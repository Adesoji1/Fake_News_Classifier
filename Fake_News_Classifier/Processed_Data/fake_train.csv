wire reported on friday about the fbis surprising announcement that it would be reopening the clinton email case due to new evidence of classified information found on sex cheat anthony weiners newly estranged husband of clinton chief aid huma abedin computer which was subject to a seperate investigation will this really yield anything significant in the  days runningup to the nov th election or is this just clever democrat party smoke and mirrors it seems that washingtons political tricksters have already sprung into action 
after comeys shock announcement a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere supplied to fox news  in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control 
elite circles fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton 
certainly a desperate democratic party and an even more desperate obama white house over the last  weeks obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal yesterdays fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios protect the president who is already deeply tied to the clinton email coverup democratic party machine has created a distraction to coverup latest wikileaks dump fbi are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring hillary clintons create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious trump scandal next week 
note despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have which they cannot by law anyway youd think hillary would have already known that it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election  if they have anything at all its just too early to tell 
see also fbi james comey was board member of hsbc  clinton foundation  drug cartel bank of choice 
the fbi director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the justice department seek an indictment against clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation  allowing clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election  despite the fact that comey stated to a congressional investigative committee that clinton was extremely careless and that clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the us secretary of state 
zero hedge adds 
now it is the democrats turn to rage at comey and the fbi although comey likely did not have much choice had he kept the information secret it certainly would have leaked as we predicted as such his best recourse was to come clean although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure needless to say all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over 
here is leaked aka just covering my ass memo from fbi director james comey 
watch this space here is a highlight reel of hillary clinton lying on at least  occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server

fbi october surprise 
according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server 
cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded 
humas estranged sexting husband 
according to a new report released via the new york times  
the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled 
this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years 
the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation 
the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week 
the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  
the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe 
the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau 
in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request 
the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face 
it remains to be seen how new case will impact the us presidential election

Shawn Helton,2016-10-29T04:22:00.000+03:00,fbi redux whats behind new probe into hillary clinton emails,"a tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the clinton campaign as the  presidential election draws to a close 
meltdown the clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details photo illustration wire 
over the weekend it was discovered through a wikileaks email dump that neera tanden of the center for american progress  john podesta s top aide had an email exchange with michael lux of progressive strategies revealing that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners was closely allied with clinton campaign manager robby mook  
political bombshell clinton campaign manager robby mook had close ties to disgraced dnc consultant robert creamer image source lockerdome  
creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president obama or other senior officials 
dnc scandal robert creamer of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky image source national vanguard  
creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky  
white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown

Mike Rivero,2016-11-02T01:43:00.000+02:00,party corruption clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced dnc consultant,"november   by wire  comments 
patrick henningsen st century wire 
the longer this soap opera drags on its becoming more and more evident that the russian government did not hack into the dnc and moscow is not feeding john podestas emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow 
the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools 
even vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it 
it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us 
what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement 
on july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans 
anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media 
you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another 
never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami 
backed by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive 
hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state 
but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty 
the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week 
and then down to almost nothing 
it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county 
at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack 
are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election 
behind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house 
on october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks 
soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response 
according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it 
image crowdstrike cyber security 
the posts nakashima then added 
the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers 
an online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said  we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities 
moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov 
despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented 
likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  
still during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it 
the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence 
we have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing 
whats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons  agencies 
air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence 
what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing 
the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda 
in both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  
under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything 
to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks 
for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it 
in  obama claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures 
this isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  
jumping the shark 
after their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative 
soon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb 
 josh schwerin joshschwerin october   
clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing 
they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead 
either way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization 
their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened 
to prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton 
the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it 
party meltdown 
wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton 
 a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper 
 a march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  
braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here 
 completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot 
in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage 
clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq 
 lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   
worse than watergate 
perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue 
some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president 
theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  
so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself 
what wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march   that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that 
obama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server 
so not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it 
sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people 
on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers 
coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news  
it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the obama justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case 
on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case  currently examining  emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top clinton aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik  who is kadzik zero hedge reports 
oh yes recall our post from last week  clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik 
oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it 
russia  the party scapegoat 
former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin 
 howard dean govhowarddean october   
another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender james carville  was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc  
i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think said carville 
maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb  and that the soviet union actually dissolved in  
these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign along with the many exposés revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks 
suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald trump in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre  
the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry  samantha power  and john kirby  already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki 
with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about 
the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late  when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like clinton and the democrats when the new year rang in  the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack said  we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that 
whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although  russianbacked rebles shootting down mh  and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in   certainly comes to mind 
that said its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped  foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over  foreign leaders  knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the  election 
on oct   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table 
we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security 
selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obamaclinton era 
knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry 
still were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in washington  before its too late

the cozy relationship between goldman sachs and the clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street 
as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week 
the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago 
money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire

while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street 
at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs 
in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  
for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits 
over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs 
by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades 
the real watershed moment came here 
blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  
key to the kingdom 
in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely 
the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked 
simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really 
in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the s 
to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office 
prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street 
prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world 
the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall 
then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut 
at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall 
the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  
they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  
how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house 
in  bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events 
in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed clinton gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis 
that clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg 
in  the washington post reported that hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton earned in excess of  million for delivering  speeches since the beginning of  a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid 
anointed chelsea clinton with goldman sachsbacked hedge funder marc mezvinsky 
the clinton family is chockfull of banking connections as chelsea clinton joined the avenue capital group which according to reports is a  billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many democratic party campaigns chelsea is married to marc mezvinsky  a former investment banker for goldman sachs chelseas tenure at avenue capital group was from  just prior to hillary clintons run for president in  since then chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the clinton foundation 
marc mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently eaglevale hellenic opportunity  after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of  million  after blowing the money on secondhand junk greek bank stocks and toxic government debt 
the apple doesnt fall far from the tree 
as it turns out marc is the son of troubled former congressman ed mezvinsky  another close friend of team clinton 
politico reports on one of ed mezvinskys financial controversies in  
in the waning days of clintons presidency federal prosecutors and the fbi were bearing down on former rep ed mezvinsky diowa who had fallen for a series of ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly  million money from other investors to cover his losses  
continuing politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from ed mezvinskys wife to then president bill clinton 
records released last week by the clinton presidential library in little rock and obtained by politico show mezvinsky and his thenwife  exrep marjorie margoliesmezvinsky dpa  pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case 
in  the daily mail reported the following chelsea clintons husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the greek economy and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds marc mezvinsky  and his partners former goldman sachs colleagues bennett grau and mark mallon raised million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation that fund however has lost  percent of its value investors with direct knowledge of the situation told the new york times  and will now be closed

the ny times further outlined the longheld clintongoldman connection just two years before the  financial crisis the clintons relationships with wall street deepened in the s when mr clinton set up his foundation in harlem and mrs clinton was elected to the senate from new york that brought her in close touch with the big wall street firms a source of jobs and tax revenue for new york  and a leading source of campaign funds for mrs clinton during her years in congress employees of goldman donated in excess of  to mrs clinton more than those of any other company except citigroup according to the center for responsive politics along with other new york politicians mrs clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate lower manhattan after the sept   attacks and those breaks helped goldman build its new roughly  billion headquarters when it broke ground in  mrs clinton and other new york officials were onsite how to monetize influence lloyd blankfein at a clinton global initiative event with hillary clinton image source sputniknews  the wall street racket to understand who powers the clinton foundations billion dollar rico influencepeddling slush fund you need to understand how money is laundered between wall street and washington dc goldman sachs jpmorgan chase morgan stanley bank of america and citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the  crash then in april of  goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for  billion dollars cnbc reported the following 
goldman sachs will pay  billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis the justice department announced monday 
authorities said goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and  crisis the settlement includes a  billion civil penalty  billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and  million to resolve various other claims 
this resolution holds goldman sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  
in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis 
whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve allowed goldman and morgan stanleybut not lehman brothersto become bank holding companies on sept   goldman was able three days later to raise  billion in equity  billion from the public and another  billion from investor warren buffett that would probably not have happened without the feds expedited decision and support a week later morgan stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a  billion equity investment from mitsubishi ufj financial group 
all told the clinton friendly investment giant goldman sachs after making record profits became the fifth megabank ordered to pay billions to the department of justice after the financial crash of  in addition the firm was ordered to pay  billion to the federal housing finance agency in   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the great recession 
in a new york review article goldman sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in  
data gathered mostly from the corporate research project  a public interest website show that on thirteen occasions between  and  goldman was penalized by us courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between  and

wall street selects team clinton 
the clinton connection to goldman sachs emerged in the early s as robert rubin  a former senior partner with goldman with a year tenure with the firm joined former president clintons economic policy team later becoming secretary of the treasury in  around that time the clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the rubinomics banner aka clintonomics the plan raised taxes on most americans specifically the middle class  in what was said to be the largest increase in american history at the time 
according to congressional record  vol part   in  the economy grew at a sickly   clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the st century 
in a multinational monitor report entitled wall streets best investment ten deregulatory steps to financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the clinton administration was revealed 
during the clinton administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even domestically the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by glasssteagall has eroded significantly 
with a pedigree that included goldman sachs the council on foreign relations cfr the brookings institution and the bilderberg group  robert rubin emerged in  as the vice chairman at citigroup  after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of glasssteagall while serving as secretary of treasury rubin made a fortune with citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the  crash heres a passage from bloomberg regarding rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse 
when it collapsed due in part to bankfriendly policies that rubin advocated he made more than  million while others lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the clintonera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster 
sworn fbi director james comey sworn in by former doj head eric holder image source thewhitehousespin  
under the microscope 
over the summer wire observed some curious connections between the clinton foundation and fbi director james comey  as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the clinton family heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the clinton investigation 
many will also be unaware that before comey was installed by the obama administration as fbi director he was on the board of director at hsbc bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering  including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels forbes also points out where comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case 
if comey and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez had made a different decision about kpmg back in  kpmg would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts hsbc and standard chartered scbff  were committing on its watch bloomberg reported in  that back in june of  comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether kpmg would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations 
in  the guardian discussed the financial relationship between hsbc and the clinton foundation receiving a startling  million in donations from clients of the large bank 
the charitable foundation run by hillary clinton and her family has received as much as m from wealthy international donors who were clients of hsbcs controversial swiss bank 
leaked files from hsbcs swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation with accounts in geneva 
a new update on the fbi investigation into the clinton foundation was announced over the last  hours in addition the recently reopened clinton email probe from last week it remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be 
to call it collusion would be an understatement when looking back at the financial affairs of the clintons goldman sachs and others on wall street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate

Shawn Helton,2016-11-04T00:03:00.000+02:00,partners in crime goldman sachs the clintons  wall street,"st century wire says 
this should be the biggest revelation yet from wikileaks already epic email trove will the us media cover this story 
last night in an rt exclusive interview conducted by awardwinning filmmaker john pilger wikileaks editor and founder julian assange described what he believes is the most significant email in the whole collection 
wikileaks reveals an early  email where the outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton was urging john podesta  then advisor to president barack obama to bring pressure on gulf states saudi arabia and qatar which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil islamic state is isis and other radical sunni groups 
this constitutes proof that the clinton foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from the same gulf states which both secretary clinton and president obama knew were funding isis al nusra front al qaeda in syria and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations 
in addition the clintons foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies 
infographic conservative post  
this latest news validates what wire has been saying since the isis crisis began in june  
according to fox news  fbi sources have said that indictments are likely for the clinton foundation investigation one only wonders how this latest assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning 
assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against clinton and her family foundation 
all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis 
during their minute interview filmed at the ecuadorian embassy in london assange and pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between clinton as secretary of state the clinton foundation and gulf monarchies who financed them the following is an excerpt from the interview transcript 
john pilger the saudis the qataris the moroccans the bahrainis particularly the first two are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hillary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales particularly saudi arabia 
julian assange under hillary clinton  and the clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggestever arms deal in the world was made with saudi arabia more than  billion during her tenure the total arms exports from the us doubled in dollar value 
jp of course the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the clinton foundation 
ja yes

No Author,2016-11-04T15:33:00.000+02:00,wikileaks hillary clinton knew saudi qatar were funding isis  but still took their money for foundation,"st century wire says 
yesterday wikileaks editor and founder julian assange confirmed what wire already knew  that hillary clinton and the obama white houses claim of the us election process being hacked by the russian government was a desperate work of fiction not content with that fish tale hillary clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the russians 
the following statement made by hillary clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  its time for trump to answer serious questions about his ties to russia httpstcodosmyvar pictwittercomdryempjx 
 hillary clinton hillaryclinton october   
apparently hillary clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the clinton campaign which ran on a questionable prodemocratic party online news outlet on monday the slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named franklin foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline was a trump server communicating with russia 
whatever legitimacy the slate had before last night just evaporated 
john roberts from forbes explains the bottom line is that slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season as for foer he says on twitter a follow up piece is in the works 
roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word retraction 
cyber feud assange believes clinton has gone beyond the pale with her russian conspiracy obsession 
during his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker john pilger when asked what he thought of hillary clintons shrill antics julian assange said  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick 
the saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the clinton campaign and the democratic party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty like hillary clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess 
still clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of donald trump in a tmzstyle tabloid sting that pretty much sums up democratic party strategy for this election season 
assange was right clinton the democratic party and their surrogate are eating themselves such are the spoils of power in washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it

over the past months hillary clinton the obama white house and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that  russia is hacking the us election  blaming moscow for the wikileaks emails the dnc leaks and for allegedly hacking us voting systems despite the grand accusations no evidence or proof has been offered by the us government 
it goes without saying how damaging the democratic partys crazed witch hunt has been to usrussian relations where clinton has led the antirussian crusade and demonizing president vladimir putin at every opportunity 
todays stunning presidential victory by donald trump means that all eyes are now on putin to see how moscow and washington will be interfacing going forward 
with such sensitive geopolitical issues like syria and the ukraine currently in play what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward 
in a message to donald trump russian president vladimir putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between moscow and washington in keeping with each others views meets the interests of both russia and the us 
putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing russianamerican relations out of their current crisis 
the russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some burning issues that are currently on the international agenda and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security ria novosti reported 
on top of it putin has expressed confidence that building a constructive dialogue between moscow and washington based on principles of equality mutual respect and each others positions meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community 
according to many observers usrussia relations are now at their lowest point since the cold war putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of russias relations with the us was not our choice however 
for things to improve between moscow and washington the us should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect russias interests rather than try to dictate terms putin said last month 
we are concerned with the deterioration of russianamerican relations but that was not our choice we never wanted that on the contrary we want to have friendly relations with the us a great country and a leading economy putin said at an economic forum in moscow

shawn helton st century wire 
antitrump street protests linked to the soros funded organization moveonorg have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the  presidential election result 
mainstream media outlets like cnn and msnbc have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage drowning out all other news stories including a successful transition meeting between the president elect and president barack obama 
outsider vs insider manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of trump presidency photo illustration wires shawn helton 
the free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antitrump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon 
washington dc  billionaire globalist financier george soros moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation  and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media 
wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least  major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle  and several other cities saw protests according to usa today 
in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous 
soros affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon 
americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election results 
hundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobia 
tonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesdays presidential election 
the gatherings  organized by moveonorg and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible 
within two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than  gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon 
soros agitprop empire 
last year during the ongoing european migrant crisis startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban left photo concerning the role played by soros 
pm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations open society institute was entrenched in a  circle of activists that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network 
the stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement  aka ows in  as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson missouri in  along with other black lives matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest 
back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in  and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement 
as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future trump campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage  shortly after trump started speaking then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away 
in a politico article in early  entitled  major donors consider funding black lives matter  we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance 
major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize  black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife democracy alliance board member susan sandler are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement 
it worth noting how soros a long time contributor to hillary clinton donated  million in pac money in  and january of  soros reportedly gave  million to boost clintons campaign  soros also recently funded  million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond 
look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances 
social engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media ngos and social media image source abc news  
during the last month it was revealed how investigative nonprofit project veritas found evidence that the dnc paid participants to incite violence at trump rallies during the course of the  election 
if those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also us criminal law 
paid protest social justice warriors incite antitrump violence across the us image source youtube  
usa color revolutions 
both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare these political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions ultimately a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective 
this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas  and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state 
inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg  as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests 
it still remains to be seen if trumps stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency 
but one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the th president and the public should question why 
legal action against soros groups 
in a recent report featured at rt news we learn that george soros and blm activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in dallas and baton rouge the father of the dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a black lives matter protest is suing the organizations activists and george soros for  million  in a separate suit a baton rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a blm protest 
the father of patrick zamarripa filed a lawsuit against black lives matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in dallas on monday seeks  million in damages 
while defendant black lives matter claims to combat antiblack racism the lawsuit said according to the fort worth star telegram the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities jews and caucasians defendant black lives matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang 
the misguided machinations behind the antitrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect will these protest groups be a reboot of the ows movement occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into  and beyond

we have seen soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries most recently in ukraine with the soros sponsored maidan coup 
now it looks like soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming trump presidency 
we do know thanks to wikileaks that george soros was a huge supporter of hillary clinton as hillary clinton was always looking out of george soros best interests 
we are certain trumps victory is a bitter pill for globalist soros to swallow between putin and trump soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter

if trump wins expect the likes of soros and moveonorg to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs who will protest riot smash and burn their way on to cnns  hour news rotation expect occupy  and blacklivesmatter to rage 
on friday henningsen talked to rt international about the postelections protests that were coordinated in part by democratic party community organizing online platform moveonorg  watch 
 not surprisingly moveonorg have also launched a national activist campaign to  abolish the electoral college  after democratic candidate hillary clinton came up short with  including new hampshire to donald trumps  including arizona and michigan final totals are not yet in but thus far  would be the fifth time in us history that a presidential candidate has won the white house while losing the total popular vote

wire associate editor shawn helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in cia and sorosfunded color revolutions overseas  are now being deployed on us domestic shores by similar ngo front organizations has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of donald trump 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests says helton 
helton also raised the question as to why president obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests opting instead to lead from behind he explains 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency

the election campaign might be over but the mainstream medias campaign against president elect donald trump is in full swing 
between all of the fake polling intentionally proclinton partisan coverage and mainstream media collusion with the democratic national party and the clinton campaign exposed through wikileaks podesta email dump  nearly the entire us mainstream media is now in full damagelimitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left 
its now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes 
cbs news flagship investigative program  minutes conducted a recorded interview with trump on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public or at schools in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by trump but instead mainstream cbs buried it for  days until  minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide if cbs had any credibility remaining this certainly will have finished it off 
when told about alleged reports of a trump supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win trump told interviewer leslie stahl  i am so saddened to hear that he then added and i say stop it if it helps i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras stop it 
one big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by trump supporters against muslims and latinos and even though its obvious that trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim this was driveby media at its worst in fact not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors or even hoaxes 
now its perfectly understandable that trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary clinton has left many democrats especially millennial collegeaged students upset angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that trump won as much as they are upset that they lost the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correctobsessed young adults the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future in reality much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets 
in fact one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit trump and to help stoke more nationwide protests 
buzzfeed reported via religion of peace  
a woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the university of louisiana at lafayette including one wearing a donald trump hat made up the story police said in a statement 
the woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab a scarf sometimes worn by muslim women the advertiser reported 
lafayette police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation the paper reported 
during the course of the investigation the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males the statement reportedly read 
note this story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of selfdescribed journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of americas corrupt liberal mainstream media 
thats right  this was just another hoax 
violent democraticaffiliated street gangs 
what leslie stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at cbs and  minutes have obscured is the fact since tuesdays election nearly all of the socalled violent hate crimes have been carried out against trump supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly democrat party supporters 
here are just a few examples michellemalkin even high school kids are not spared student trump supporter attacked at woodside high school httpstcoetvvdjo 
 mama angel mommysaurus november   
watch this clip taken from the radical leftist portland protests this weekend where democratic party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a trump supporter these violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the democratic party and the sitting president of the united states barack obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the democratic partys online community organizer network moveonorg  a digital platform partly funded by leading clinton donor and billionaire george soros  watch this stunning clip 
 here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago  yr old david wilcox who was driving and scraped another vehicle when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information wilcox was greeted by a gang of africanamericans presumably democratic party supporters who began pointing and shouting you voted for donald trump before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital 
from reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for donald trump it appears as if they attacked him because he was white so could one call this a case of black on white racism regardless its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism in this instance the violence was partisan and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of america watch this disturbing video  agitator and chief where is obama 
these incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national us media who are obviously still working to discredit the trump presidency 
amidst all this violence however where is the current president obama or the democratic partys losing candidate hillary clinton  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives its almost as if obama and clinton are enjoying the unrest most certainly though obama clinton and the democratic party are hoping to use this weeks mediagenerated liberal angst as future political leverage 
what used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program  minutes has gradually become a joke it seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest opting instead for running bland people magazine and time magazinestyle safe segments judging by its plummeting ratings and its predictable cast of job for life governmentapproved media gatekeepercumcommentators like anderson cooper and lesley stahl there is little hope for this institution you might even say its irredeemable  
one of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was cnn host brian stelter photo left whose own show is ironically titled reliable sources stelter is meant to be cnns media watchdog person laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst after leading cnns own exposed efforts to obscure and derail trumps presidential run while working to cover for a hugely unpopular even among democrats hillary clinton candidacy stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of us elections but its too late the damage has already been done and cnn will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain they are a dirty media outlet and now everyone knows it 
now cbs news has been exposed in public view but their crime is even worse than cnns which was just dirty politics in comparison cbs news took it upon itself to compromise public safety and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position twenty years ago this might have been considered shameful but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage 
none of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years

william mcgurn wall street journal 
lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan and its all okeydokey 
then again mr trump has already been likened to hitler mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective hohum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values 
this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group 
each presidential election the drill goes like this 
after republicans nominate someone he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater  of africanamericans of women of gays etc 
this year democrats added a twist mr trump they claim represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney  john mccain and george w bush  of course this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president 
 in  for example an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that thengov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck mr byrds daughter says so when gov george w bush refused to support hatecrimes legislation it was like my father was killed all over again 
 when john mccain ran in  barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one 
 in  when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them facetoface about his opposition to obamacare the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly telling a largely africanamerican audience that if mr romney were to win hed put yall back in chains

the person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the white house it may well be donald j trump but further due diligence is required to ensure that american democracy is not threatened 
st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign  
as it turns out the only thing illegitimate about the  election was the mainstream corporate media

a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

Mike Rivero,2016-11-24T03:37:00.000+02:00,hillary clinton supporters now calling for a recount of votes in battleground states,"while richard spencers halfjoke of hailing donald trump with r oman salute rose a lot of dust some remarks in his npi speech point into rather sinister direction a posthuman one 
transcript with references and additional av material 
undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when hillary clinton lost presidential elections to donald trump if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism  dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger 
however party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image will be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib  
in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement richard spencer in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun 
this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent  a manifestation of will as spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting übermenschen  from nietzsche to postmodern occultists 
however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy nietzsche in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as spencer apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement 
the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos 
in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november  st  

triumph of the will or hipster babylon working 

in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark 
but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of will  we willed donald trump into office made this dream into reality  
it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic 
well start our explanation with lesser weirdness 
meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works 
well it works because it is magical 

chaos magick 

here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  
therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs 
the goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet 
the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  
there are many interesting implications to this 
the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  
in this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick 
trump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other 
in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group 
so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness 


we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek 
well the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic 
namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos 
the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless 
it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek 
a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification 
however it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum 
one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs 
every post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard 
with the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on 
since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated 
out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general 
and a god was born  source  

synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction 
namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality 
i would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos 

posthuman traditionalism 

i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  
in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends 
the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for 
well end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name 
so without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail

Branko Mali,2016-11-25T14:33:14.332+02:00,hell comes to frogtown alt right and triumph of transhumanism,"st century wire says 
if there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the eus super bureaucratic class those doubts can finally be put to rest this week it seems that europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of euro red scare brainwashing 
the new eu resolution compares russian media organizations to terrorist groups like isis see full report below the report also claims that russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values  the new antirussia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the antirussia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy a touch oxymoronic isnt it 
eu parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot claiming that europe is currently at war with russia is one thing but the hysterical notion that russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of europeans is a whole new level of crazy 
no wonder millions of britons voted to leave the eu this past summer 
the cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on rt are by presenters contributors and pundits  westerners  not russians the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc cnn and other establishment outlets by spending most of their time effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over rt understood this in  when their news network took shape  years later western media moguls are playing catchup albeit in vainsunset for goebbels hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good they are simply unable to do authentic journalism or speak truth to power  incredibly instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime ideologues in brussels want to attack rt 
the faceless force behind this latest xenophobic eu resolution are those in washington paris and london who are still hellbent on keeping antirussian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many european businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with russia when donald trump is sworn in this january the usukeu antirussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some damage as europes neomccarthyites plot their escape out the back door from their disastrous coup detat in the ukraine  to natos hubris in the baltic and beyond and the eus migrant crisis debacle and the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last  years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy underpinned by a backward and confused ideology 
we tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre brussels adventure see the following video and written report by rt international 
 rt meps in strasbourg have voted on a nonlegislative resolution which calls for the eu to respond to information warfare by russia rt and sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda 
the eu parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the west russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday commenting on the vote 
putin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  russia on democracy european lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues 
 the best approach is an open discussion in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented  putin said 
adding that he hopes the western move to  counter russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions the president congratulated rt and sputnik journalists on their work 
in the wednesday vote  meps supported the resolution based on the report  eu strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties  with  voting against it and  abstaining 
written by a polish member of the european conservatives and reformists ecr group anna fotyga the report alleged that moscow aims to  distort the truth provoke doubt divide the eu and its north american partners paralyze the decisionmaking process discredit the eu institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among eu citizens  
the report suggests that moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in eu member states causing disintegration within the bloc 
at the same time russia is accused of  information warfare  with such entities as rt tv channel sputnik news agency rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the russkiy mir russian world fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools  
the document places russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as islamic state is formerly isisisil 
the report also mentions some  social media and internet trolls  from russia who are thought to  challenge democratic values  
it called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived russian propaganda threat by means of  investing in awareness raising education online and local media  it also suggests stronger cooperation between the eu and nato  on strategic communication  
sputnik has already appealed to the un the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and a number of international journalists organizations and ngos including reporters without borders to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the eu 
 the resolution hits straight at a number of respected media including sputnik agency and has an aim to stop their activity in the eu moreover the resolution bluntly contradicts the eus own human rights and freedom of press norms reads the letter signed by sputnik editorinchief margarita simonyan 
during the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote meps campaigning for the resolution said the eu was  at war with russia on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter

No Author,2016-11-25T02:49:00.000+02:00,eu red scare brussels passes new resolution to counter russian media propaganda," share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency ap photo  dennis system 
columbus oh ap  history was made today in columbus ohio when more than  million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood aab an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community endorse donald trump for president that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population which the united states census bureau says numbers more than  million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president with the full force of the amish community behind him donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november 
the organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about  amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges such as urban sprawl that face the community this year however the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee 
the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process 
over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of  timothy  we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way 
according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeightcom there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote 
the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models 
the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision 
i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent 
most pundits believe that mrs clintons plea is too little too late 
during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price 
though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose  of its staff over the next two weeks there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses 
it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant cleary mrs clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price its really sad to see the campaign end this way

Jimmy Rustling,2016-10-27T13:00:00.000+03:00,the amish in america commit their vote to donald trump mathematically guaranteeing him a presidential victory  abc news," share president obama has signed an executive order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on december th ap photo  dennis system 
washington dc ap  following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order   which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december  th  obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day  too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted  equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically 
people all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump 
under the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take  days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on dec  th with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college 
not surprisingly donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision 
crooked hillary lost this election fair and square they tried to rig this election against me but the american people didnt allow that to happen president obama doesnt care about what the american people want i said the system was rigged all along and this proves i was right 
the president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college 
we have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states we still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary 
paul horner a professor of political science at ucla believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election 
most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the united states but there is nothing in the constitution that says that hillary clinton won the popular vote by more than  votes  but because of the electoral college she still lost that decision is reserved solely for the  electors who meet in their respective states on december  th  what the people are actually voting for are their states electors not for the president though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching that does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future the way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them 
political analyst matt daemon told abc news that he agrees with the presidents executive order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether 
the electoral college is a fking joke we should be using the popular vote instead it may have made sense in  but so did the three fifths compromise  everyone should have an equal vote and thats just not the case with the electoral college you know what the electoral college gave us it gave us george w bush it gave us a war in iraq and the worst recession since the great depression its time to bring our system into the  st century i hope obama fixes this because president trump is going to be a nightmare 
obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward 
were going to investigate the fbi into their role in all of this obama said why did fbi director james comey on sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring hillary clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election why wasnt this news released earlier how many votes were lost because of this obama said if all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in december a recount will be ordered

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails   
october    
by charles c johnson  comments  
give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

why bill clintons  trips on the lolita express child rape jet matter may    
daniel greenfield   
we dont know what bill clinton did or didnt do in company with jeffrey epstein but we certainly know what epstein did and almost as outrageously what he got away with doing  

some of the most shocking allegations against epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an fbi probe in civil suits brought by his victims for example the claim that three yearold french girls were delivered to him as a birthday present but the feds did identify roughly  young women most of them underage at the time who described being lured to epsteins palm beach home on the pretense of giving a massage for money then pressured into various sex acts as well as the balkan sex slave epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just  more recently a big cash payment from mail on sunday coaxed one of epsteins main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy this victim virginia roberts produced a photo of herself with prince andrew in  and reported that epstein paid her  to meet the prince then  years old she claims that she was abused by epstein and loaned to his friends from the age of  

sex crimes of the kind roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of  to  years in federal prison yet when all was said and done epstein served his scant yearplusonemonth in a private wing of the palm beach jail and was granted a hourperday free pass to leave the premises for work 

in short epstein was never actually in jail during his house arrest he flew around the country on his jets from his new york city place to his private island at least one of epsteins victims claimed to have met bill clinton and it turns out that bill clinton was a much more regular passenger on the lolita express 

former president bill clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least  trips aboard the lolita express  even apparently ditching his secret service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by foxnewscom 

clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls 

it doesnt help that the democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting epstein a pass on child rape that bill clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money 

either way weve come a long way from gary hart being bounced for monkey business to bill clinton flying around on a child rapists plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it 

social conservatives often get a bad rap but there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window what did bill clinton actually do who knows more importantly these days who cares 

about daniel greenfield 

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 

for sure defence counsel have made much of taylors involvement with the missing and murdered women all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac the real killer whats not in dispute is that taylor is one scary character  streethardened menacing a procurer of prostitutes lured to the pickton farm contemptuous of both sextrade workers especially street walkers and drug addicts 

shes pure evil says one outreach worker who asked that her name not be used in any story about taylor 

 

court has heard that taylors dna was found on  items retrieved from the pickton property  including handcuffs condoms clothing syringes  and also on items that belonged to some victims  brenda wolfes lipstick mona wilsons rosary 

one witness pickton pal pat casanova told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as angel whod been brought to the farm by taylor he said he gave the money to taylor who shared some of it with angel 

another witness gina houston put taylor on the same bed with victim sereena abotsway in picktons trailer 

in his lengthy police interview pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with taylor 

on the stand houston recounted a conversation shed had with pickton about taylor shortly before his arrest 

willie told me that he believed she taylor would do the right thing when she came back that she would take responsibility for what she said she would take responsibility for

jeff wells points to other odd things 

a week or so ago a man called steve remian committed suicidebycop but the name steve remian surfaced at the robert willie pickton murder trial in new westminster bc last march when jurors were told that remians name  with a burnaby bc address  was on the label of a suitcase packed into a box found in picktons workshop 

in april jurors heard further evidence that dna testing on two hairs found on a hudsons bay blanket removed from picktons motorhome linked one to pickton and the other to a steve remian 

a source involved in the oakville shooting investigation told the star that the man shot by police had been charged with sexual assault earlier in life while living in oakville but had been acquitted although a coaccused was convicted 

source 

it does seem like a regular hive of activity robert picktons pig farm was a constant buzz of activity with people and vehicles coming and going all the time a woman who lived in picktons trailer for a time testified on wednesday 

tanya carr  told the jury in picktons murder trial that people were coming and going all day long at the port coquitlam bc farm and it wasnt unusual for people to show up late at night looking for pickton or his brother dave 

source 

also there are those hells angels and the piggy palace 

it was a rough crowd at piggys palace said brian a musician who played there a few years ago with the hardrock band south city slam 

the nightclub he said was inside an old building on a property dave pickton and his brother robert own at  burns rd near their pig farm on dominion road in port coquitlam 

even the women were tough looking  a lot of leather and denim it wasnt a cocktailgown kind of place  he recalled 

brian who didnt want his last name used recalled that there was a coatcheck girl and a sign saying check your knives and other weapons at the door  

the crowd at piggys palace often included men wearing hells angels biker club colours 

they were there a lot said brian the people who came all seemed to know one another

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

hiring spree seeks pornpeddler others 

in an unrelated starnet matter the vancouverbased internet gambling and pornography company appears eager to mount a new hiring spree recruiting staff in numerous positions including its porn division which it hopes to quickly sell off 

in a large ad on thursday in the georgia straight a vancouver weekly entertainment newspaper starnet is soliciting a marketing representative for its entertainment division amongst numerous other posted jobs do you have the ability to think outside the curve starnet asks in its pornpeddler posting the company states that this position requires strategic thinking and implementation directly relating to redlightcom and adultvcom 

queasy websurfers may want to take a pass on these sites at least redlightcom which offers a much hardercore home page than starnets main porn sites sizzlercom and chiselcom redlightcoms home page offers an extremely explicit mix of teaser shots including a graphic livesex video clip while starnet wants to dump its porn business its latest ad seeks a marketer to maintain continual market research of new forms of advertising and demographics with overall participation in the team effort the thursday recruitment ad came three days after starnets monday disclosure that it hopes to quickly auction off its adult entertainment division assets with documentation to be complete in  days 

this redlightcom site happens to be the same starnet site targeted by the police in their proposed single criminal count of adult pornography while no charges have yet been laid against starnet or any directors or employees the information to obtain a courtfiled document supporting the search warrant notes eight proposed counts including one of possession for the purpose of publication distribution or circulation computerized pictures depicting obscene acts the police note that fetish one of redlightcoms seven sections shows  images of nude bondage women with clamps on body parts women with horse bridles and bits in their mouths and women hanging by their arms from straps or belts 

the latest starnet recruitment ad also suggests it is business as usual at starnet despite the weekago raid by more than  officers from the rcmp cleu the ontario provincial police the united states customs service and the us internal revenue service 

the georgia straight ad seeks a worldbroadcastscom manager an internet marketing manager html programmers graphic designers an investor relations administrative assistant an adminstrative assistant of production and sports odds analysts starnet seeks openminded innovative people who enjoy working in a dynamic fun team atmosphere and are able to work creatively under pressure 

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails   
october    
by charles c johnson  comments  
give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information 

stay tuned for more 

k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story  

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months 

super serco bulldozes ahead  
by daily mail reporter updated  gmt  september  
serco has come a long way since the s when it ran the fourminute warning system to alert the nation to a ballistic missile attack 

today its bn order book is bigger than many countries defence budgets it is bidding for a further bn worth of contracts and sees bn of opportunities 

profit growth is less ballistic the firsthalf pretax surplus rose  to m net profits just  to m stripping out goodwill the rise was  with dividends up  to p 

serco runs the docklands light railway five uk prisons airport radar and forest bulldozers in florida  

 serco farewell to npl after  years of innovation  january  serco said goodbye to the national physical laboratory npl at the end of december  after  years of extraordinary innovation and science that has seen the establishment build a worldleading reputation and deliver billions of pounds of benefit for the uk economy during that period under serco s management and leadership npl has delivered an extraordinary variety and breadth of accomplishments for the uks economy and industry some of the key achievements during that time have been it has been estimated that work carried out by the centre of carbon measurement at npl will save eight million tonnes of carbon emissions reductions  of uk footprint and over half a billion pounds in economic benefit over the next decade npls caesium fountain atomic clock is accurate to  second in  million years and npl is playing a key role in introducing rigour to high frequency trading for serco s front running banks in the city through npl zulu time 

uk cabinet office  emergency planning college  serco types of exercise workshop exercises these are structured discussion events where participants can explore issues in a less pressurised environment they are an ideal way of developing solutions procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making table top exercises these involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line either in realtime or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas the participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise tabletop exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations commandcontrol post exercises these are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems feeling lucky punk  this could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support the gold standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan such exercises also test information flow communications equipment procedures decision making and coordination live exercises these can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a fullscale rehearsal they are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with highrisk situations they are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with command post exercises as part of a wider exercising package  

christopher rajendran hyman cbe born  july  in durban south africa was chief executive of serco group plc from  to october   on graduation he worked for arthur andersen in  he won an month exchange with ernst  young in london who employed him after four months head hunted in  by serco  hyman became european finance director and in  was made group finance director in  hyman became chief executive  hyman resigned from his role of chief executive of serco on  october  following allegations that serco had overcharged government customers  he was making a presentation to serco shareholder including british and saudi governments on the th floor of the world trade center north tower at the time of the september  attacks in  

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

the case of the vanishing visa files  
december    pm pst  
by chuck goudie   
december   chicago  potentially important evidence has disappeared in a terrorism case involving two chicago men their visa records vanished from chicagos indian consulate it comes one week after the abc  iteam raised questions about how david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place 

the case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from mumbai to michigan avenue indias foreign secretary nirupama rao told reporters overseas wednesday that she wants answers from chicagos indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared records that might show how two accused chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in india 

top officials of chicagos india consulate wouldnt talk to the iteam on camera last week when asked how terror suspects david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained fiveyear unlimited passage visas to india 

and the consul general did not return calls wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process headley and ranas visas which indian foreign secretary nirupama rao announced wednesday have disappeared 

wednesday evening the chicago consul general emailed a statement to the iteam that conflicted with government statements made in india the brief statement read we have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to david coleman headley and tahawwur rana hussain relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the government of india 

indias counterpart to the fbi is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the  mumbai massacre 

the two chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault rana was denied bond by a chicago district judge tuesday despite family members and friends offering  million in cash and property rana has not been directly charged with the mumbai attack that left  dead but was linked to the assault in government court filings 

headley a pakistanborn chicagoan is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was daood giliani he changed his name to ease travel to india according to federal prosecutors in chicago and to avoid the required previsa background check by indian authorities 

since the time headley and rani were processed indias chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called travisa outsourcing that on its website claims we have revolutionized the way people get their visas 

and the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year 

the advantages of outsourcing is the travisa company which is handling the outsourcing has set up a call center said ashok kumar attri consul general 

foreign secretary rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the us has given to indian investigators headley and rana are not due back in court until january

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

benghazi consulate attackers used militarystyle tactics say us officials  
experts still unsure whether assault that killed  americans in libya could have been prevented  
by matt apuzzo and kimberly dozier   
september    am  washington ap  the heavily armed extremists who laid siege to the us consulate in libya used militarystyle tactics that may have steered americans toward a waiting ambush us officials said friday as they pieced together details about how the compound was overrun 

us intelligence indicates that  or more people many of them masked were responsible for the sept  assault on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi gun trucks provided added firepower the attackers set up a perimeter controlling access in and out of the compound a first wave of attacks sent the americans fleeing to a fallback building where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire 

intelligence reports were still coming in but officials told the associated press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an antiislam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation 

in a country coming off a civil war a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance how much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions officials said 

the attacks killed ambassador chris stevens diplomat sean smith and two former navy seals who us officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials stevens was visiting benghazi from tripoli to preside over the opening of an american space cultural center 

the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports they stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in benghazi fbi agents from new york and washington were in libya investigating the attack 

what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack secretary of state hillary clinton said friday and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four americans 

officials have not singled out one responsible group but have focused their attention on ansar alshariah a libyan militant group led by a former detainee at the us militaryrun prison in guantanamo bay cuba 

since the civil war that ousted libyan dictator moammar gadhafi last year the country has been awash with rebels militias and terrorists weaponry is easy to come by both from the former regime from weapons depots looted during the war and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion the origin of the weapons used in the assault on the us compound was unclear officials said

an angry john podesta issues a statement on reopening of fbi probe   
by tyler durden   
oct    pm while hillary has yet to address todays stunning letter by fbi director comey who reported that the federal bureau of investigations has opened a probe into hillary clintons email as a result of findings on what the nyt reported was an electronic device belonging to anthony wiener a clearly angry john podesta clintons recently hacked campaign chair issued the following statement in response to fbi letter to gop congressional chairmen 

in response to the letter sent by fbi director james convey to eight republican committee chairman in congress hillary for america chair john podesta released the following statement friday 

upon completing this investigation more than three months ago fbi director comet declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call in the months since donald trump and his republican allies have been baselessly secondguessing the fbi and in both public and private browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm hillary clintons presidential campaign 

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information 

stay tuned for more

 serco farewell to npl after  years of innovation  january  serco said goodbye to the national physical laboratory npl at the end of december  after  years of extraordinary innovation and science that has seen the establishment build a worldleading reputation and deliver billions of pounds of benefit for the uk economy during that period under serco s management and leadership npl has delivered an extraordinary variety and breadth of accomplishments for the uks economy and industry some of the key achievements during that time have been it has been estimated that work carried out by the centre of carbon measurement at npl will save eight million tonnes of carbon emissions reductions  of uk footprint and over half a billion pounds in economic benefit over the next decade npls caesium fountain atomic clock is accurate to  second in  million years and npl is playing a key role in introducing rigour to high frequency trading for serco s front running banks in the city through npl zulu time

christopher rajendran hyman cbe born  july  in durban south africa was chief executive of serco group plc from  to october   on graduation he worked for arthur andersen in  he won an month exchange with ernst  young in london who employed him after four months head hunted in  by serco  hyman became european finance director and in  was made group finance director in  hyman became chief executive  hyman resigned from his role of chief executive of serco on  october  following allegations that serco had overcharged government customers  he was making a presentation to serco shareholder including british and saudi governments on the th floor of the world trade center north tower at the time of the september  attacks in  

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

last night a leaked memo was revealed indicating fbi director james comeys stated reasons for reopening the clinton email probe upon discovering what now appear to be tens of thousands of huma abedin emails located on anthony weiners notebook comey revealed two core reasons for the action a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup what he did not reveal and as has emerged overnight from a report by the new yorkers jane mayer is that comey also acted in contravention to doj practices and more importantly acted contrary to the preference of doj head loretta lynch whose infamous meeting with bill clinton on the phoenix tarmac at the end of june will likely be reassessed in light of these latest revelations 


according to the new yorker comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
traditionally the justice department has advised prosecutors and law enforcement to avoid any appearance of meddling in the outcome of elections even if it means holding off on pressing cases  one former senior official recalled that janet reno the attorney general under bill clinton completely shut down the prosecution of a politically sensitive criminal target prior to an election  she was adamantanything that could influence the election had to go dark the former official said please go to zero hedge to read the entire article",english,abeldanger.net,No Image URL,bs,title,source zero hedge tyler durden oct last night leaked memo revealed indicating fbi director james comeys stated reasons reopening clinton email probe upon discovering appear tens thousands huma abedin emails located anthony weiners notebook comey revealed two core reasons action sense obligation lawmakers concern word new email discovery would leak media raise questions coverup reveal emerged overnight report new yorkers jane mayer comey also acted contravention doj practices importantly acted contrary preference doj head loretta lynch whose infamous meeting bill clinton phoenix tarmac end june likely reassessed light latest revelations according new yorker comeys decision make public new evidence may raise additional legal questions clinton contrary views attorney general according wellinformed administration official lynch expressed preference comey follow departments longstanding practice commenting ongoing investigations taking action could influence outcome election said felt compelled otherwise traditionally justice department advised prosecutors law enforcement avoid appearance meddling outcome elections even means holding pressing cases one former senior official recalled janet reno attorney general bill clinton completely shut prosecution politically sensitive criminal target prior election adamantanything could influence election go dark former official said please go zero hedge read entire article,1,,,,,

do not forgive the msm 

the msm turned on hillary the fbi turned on hillary want to know why because in florida where they flipped a huge number of votes trump still had  percent of the vote nationwide they did not have the vote scam machines everywhere and when that got averaged in trump took  percent of the votes nationwide even with the stolen votes subtracted from the average the fbi fox cnn everyone else knew the gig was up and is now only moving to say sorry so they dont go to jail 

well ive got news for you they are still the same lying despicable malfunctioning trash scum they always were they showed their worth and we would be idiots to forgive them no matter how badly they burn hillary 

cnn is despicable trash we all witnessed it never forgive them  because they have proven their worth already no matter what they do they cant recover from what they have done they are garbage a disease bleachworthy filth and i hope trump erases them ditto for all of the rest of the msm including the huffington post snopes abccbsfoxyounameit  all of them are the lowest of filth that is now heading for the darkness of the nearest sewer to get away from the coming bulldozer 

the fbi is a trash agency along with the rest of american intelligence which only works to serve the enemy for as long as it thinks its head will not be cut off all of the fbi must be disbanded and everyone in the fbi should be blackballed and never allowed to work again with the top echelons jailed for life for treason they lied about  and they knew it  and have proven they serve one purpose to protect evil ditto for the cia the nsa the dhs the tsa and all the rest of the trash all of it needs to go there is not one fragment of it that should be salvaged 

so they are all running like rats for cover they know they blew it they know they are going to be bagged for heinous crimes against america now they are putting on the biggest fakest show the world will ever witness as if they cared they never did care and i hope to god trump has a memory longer than the average jarhead and bags every last one of them when he has his day they had better run for the gates and ditch the country just like they said they would if he got elected  because if not they are heading straight to the gates of justice 

i would like to thank everyone in the altmedia who made this happen and i would also like to say that i said it all along as it was and never backed off hillary never had more than  percent national support this is something i said repeatedly that trump was always  percent supported and i never wavered and never once posted bullshit like oh lets rejoice trump is at  percent that was always a trap  a scam to justify stealing the election  and i called it as it was 

our job is not over 

the rot is there it is deeply rooted with fungus roots running all the way through the country one bottle of bleach is not going to do more than spotclean the surface we won this battle and it is not time to sit down the altmedia cannot rest until cnn and all of the rest of the msm is either bankrupted or jailed the altmedia cannot rest for as long as google is allowed to wage war on websites like this one by refusing to allow it ads if this website were allowed ads it would easily selffund with  plus per month and would probably have more than  per month denial of ads just because someone disagrees and has a monopoly established via full control of various ad firms is a flagrant violation of antitrust laws and has to be stopped dead cold 

the altmedia cannot stop until every last criminal in the fbi is jailed by the fbi i am sick of the bait tactics and false flag psyops fronted by that agency heads have got to roll piles of them especially since it has been proven that it was the fbi itself that did the first world trade center bombing with the full intent to bring one of the towers down thats the type of agency that has got to be shuttered  or we are all toast trump or not yeah i know you at the fbi are reading this go to hell 

our job will not be over until the cia is cleaned out our job is not over until the american bar association is disbanded as the criminal bloodsucking hive it is our job is not over until the top executives at the medical companies that produced the tainted autisminflicting vaccines hang with stretched necks our job will not be over until every last liberal arts and womens studies department of all universities have their staffs jailed for treason they gutted the home front in a manner which was horrific beyond belief our job is not over until all of americas great libraries are fully restored after being totally wiped out by the jews and all scientific journals and works once again become fully free and public domain our job will not be over until the childsnatching cps is shut down and their feed for their slave trade is cut off our job will not be over until american corporations begin to fight for america and bring our jobs and american quality back 

the list of what the altmedia needs to accomplish now that it appears the first huge battle has been won is practically endless but i believe the altmedia is up to the task and will succeed as long as one thing is cemented in stone 



julian assange is obviously dead 

consider these facts and then figure the odds of him being alive 

 wikileaks dns server was suddenly pointed elsewhere thats right that night in the wee hours of the morning after pamela was there to poison him police in an armored vehicle showed up at the embassy and that night the dns server pointed to a different ip address for wikileaks and google updated everything instantly so the transfer was completely seamless from the real wikileaks server to the fake wikileaks server that was at a completely different ip address 

 mr assanges subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters i reported this repeatedly 

 mr assanges tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades gavin mcfadyen became mcfayden for example mcfadyen  the director of wikileaks was found dead three days after assange started having mystery problems this is something i made a huge issue of here 

 streams of disinformation were spewed 

 themes supported by mr assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications very bad timing with that everyone with a brain noticed this and it lit up the forums and blogs 

 body double rumors have been circulated and documented 

 new strange hitherto unknown moderators of wikileaks have suddenly been installed 

 his deadman switch was activated before the armored vehicle even showed up at the embassy which means assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned much of his stored data and secret website pins were to be released in the event of his untimely death i released both deadman switches here one encrypted and one unencrypted 

all of this happened right after pamela anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned and the media talked all about how assange was pale and not feeling well when she left and that he said the food pamela brought him was torture good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the msm no doubt 

my take assange was poisoned and then removed from the embassy in an armored vehicle this was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss and i saw that and stayed up the entire night for it that is why i so strongly stated that he cant possibly still be at the embassy perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded 

if the new wikileak releases are real they are not coming from the wikileaks server  only a redirect to a different server in the name of wikileaks the ip address change proves it and we can only hope it is white hats doing it it seems so but one can only guess

conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why fbi director james comey reopened hillarys email investigation after just closing it back in july concluding that although hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against her democrats after lavishing comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an impartial way have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the  election cycle with hillary herself describing his recent actions as deeply troubling republicans on the other hand have praised comeys recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to clinton staffers 

according to the daily mail  and a source close to james comey the decision at least in part came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi who felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director 

the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 

some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 

according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 

he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 

the people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him the source continued and that includes his wife pat she kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state though were sure there are many facets behind comeys decision making process we can all be quite certain at this point that hes not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in washington both in law enforcement and in both political parties in fact after tim kaine just last week praised comey as a wonderful career public servant with the highest standards of integrity

Anonymous,2016-10-31T01:40:00.000+02:00,no title,"breaking bombshell fbi nypd insiders leak  email scandal about to take a sick and twisted turn    
source victurus libertas  


all of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific firsthand knowledge of the hillary clinton email scandal it seems that things are about to heat up we are told that of the  emails lifted from anthony weiners computer  emails are huma abedins and pay to play  including saudis and israelis meaning huma was the one hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via humas computer 

it has been established through many avenues but mainly through wikileaks that the clinton foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform paytoplay games with multiple entities including foreign nations paytoplay nations include israel saudi arabia turkey qatar kazakhstan and the ukraine 
furthermore we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms isis was created by cia and israeli secret intelligence service  with help from joe lieberman john mccain and lindsey graham an nypd insider said the content they viewed did include state department top secret emails one file was called life insurance a second file was titled  dnc nuclear arsenal  

a third file im sure hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled intimate  according to this nypd insider this file contained xrated photos of huma and hillary with a teenager  

nypd detectives were sickened by what they saw according to our insider and they had threatened fbi field agents that they would leak this information if the fbi did not step up and take off the kid gloves  at that point  of the fbi agents in nyc were also threatening to leak the information 

as you can imagine the scandal has the entire obama administration in full panic we are told there are emails that could send loretta lynch to prison  as well as bill and hillary the twitter post below our sources sent us verifying it is all true 




even more 

the following information comes straight from an fbi anonymous source who is the senior analyst who posted on chan in early july of this year 

jim comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both loretta lynch and bill clinton thus making his job impossible 

comey sent a letter to congress knowing that ultimately it would expose loretta lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to obama  the state department is terrified now comey has assembled a small team of  agents whom he has declared the untouchables after the famous federal agent eliot ness 

comey has clamped down on all fbi agents and he expects a fullscale war between the fbi and the department of justice doj the white house and the state department he has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators congressmen lobbyists and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted  one of the main targets of the probe is the clinton foundation and clinton global initiative among the targets under investigation are john podesta huma cheryl mills cnn abc nbc etc 

as it turns out weiner humas husband had been forwarding humas emails each time she came home and left her computer open huma appears to have been in touch with saudi actors and therefore espionage is strongly suspected 
comey and his   untouchables  are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in american history which is what i think must happen if comey is planning to stay part of the fbi he lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first hillary investigation it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again the pentagon has internal players and outside players they call  creatives  creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses malcontents extreme hackers or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas a pentagon program called cicada   which we have reported on previously was created by several of these talented civilians the program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the noncorrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe 

ive heard it said a vagina almost took down bill now will a weiner take down hillary lol 

again thank you to all of the insiders the whistleblowers the good fbi agents the good cia agents the good nypd officers and the noncorrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed without these brave wonderful and morally erect individuals our country would still be in the corrupted darkness

humas husband anthony weiner which blows the whole humaislam meme into the gutter all we are seeing with this is the fact the muslims running saudi arabia are crypto jews  anyway  hillary was so sure shed never be called to account with her emails that she was careless enough to have them end up on weiners personal laptop in a file he titled life insurance 

well you know how the entire establishment is wrapped up in child sex and other similar crimes and weiner ended up getting his laptop seized by the nypd in a kiddie pornchild sex investigation when the nypd went through the laptop they found hillarys emails in full unadulterated pristine form they proved crimes of the highest order  at least  felonies found so far with a majority of them related to treason and selling out the country 

so the nypd opened up a case on hillary the fbi said no well take that  and that is the only reason why these investigations got reopened because if the nypd handled it huge portions of the fbi would be sent to prison now the fbi is under pressure to actually do its job because they know the nypd knows no matter what the outcome the fbi gains zero  zero credibility points from this 

so read my report do not forgive  it was bang on they did this because they had to not because they had any intention at all of being good and it really is time to drain the swamp 

now lets all sit and wait for the suicide of preet bharara  the us prosecuting attorney for the southern district of new york and the nypd who pushed this into the light hes now a target of the fbi the dnc the clinton death machine and god knows what else prediction and i do not make predictions the director of investigations for the nypd will commit suicide within  days hes a walking dead man 

the circle of crime in washington dc is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart poking that monster in a way that hurts is something i do not believe anyone will survive preet might as well call himself a zombie 

the nypd trumped the fbi that is why they had to investigate hillary 

well well the nypd is what busted the hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on weiners laptop and that is why the fbi was forced to investigate hillary they had no choice nypd trumps fbi

 john podesta kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

 podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show 

 both were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

 kadzik lobbied podesta  then wh chief of staff  to pardon his billionaire tax dodger fugitive client marc rich whose wife gave  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon fbi director james comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and hillary clinton put all over the face of fbi agency by reopening hillary clintons case thanks to kemails linked to sex scandal of huma abedins husband anthony weiner and the mutiny of fbi agents who wont put up with comeys crap we are suppose to finally get justice 

but guess what doj assigned a clinton ally and john podestas very close friend peter kadzik to take charge of the new investigation 

in a letter to congress the doj writes that it will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible assistant attorney general peter j kadzik writes in letters to house and senate lawmakers 

who is peter kadzik 

according to an excellent article published by daily caller 

the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 

the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 


podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

the postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures 

kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 

in the trenches 

podesta and kadzik have a long history  one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal 

kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 

that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account 

in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 

podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 

kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 

to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   

a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 

the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 

on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library

extraterrestrials the other day and of course at the end of the article the tired line about extraordinary measuresblah blah blah came out towards the end of the article this needs to stop when talking about extraterrestrials it may have been an extraordinary claim  years ago but its not today with the scientific evidence we have today many people including one of the top scientist of our time has reached the conclusion that extraterrestrials exist based on the evidence hawking saidaliens almost certainly exist these are conclusions reached based on the evidence not extraordinary claims the article was on a possible signal that could be of extraterrestrial origin this signal matches a prediction made in  and its just science this is what was said at the end of the article and its this type of thinking that needs to stop with things like water found on other planets exoplanets in habitable zones extremophiles in places we thought life couldnt exist building blocks of life found on comets and more saying extraterrestrials exist isnt an extraordinary claim but a possible explanation based on the evidence heres what was said the one in  objects with unusual spectra seen by borra and trottier are certainly worthy of additional study the team said in a statement however extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence it is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations internationally agreedupon protocols for searches for evidence of advanced life beyond earth seti require candidates to be confirmed by independent groups using their own telescopes and for all natural explanations to be exhausted before invoking extraterrestrial agents as an explanation wwwindependentcouk first the scientist who are behind this study never said unequivocally this is an old tactic thats used by some people on this board from time to time they cant debate the evidence presented so they try to make it seem as you made a blanket sstatement the scientist say probably right there on the updated comments on their published paper heres what they said but they make clear that further work will need to be done to confirm or deny that hypothesis that will need to be done by watching for the same signals on different equipment so that all other explanations can be discarded again nobody said unequivocally i hate it when people do that this is why i always ask people to quote me where i said this or that because when people cant debate the evidence they try to debate against things that were never said they also said this all natural explanations need to be exhausted before extraterrestrials are invoked as a possible explanation what that makes no sense this standard would make it almost impossible to find an extraterrestrial signal in most cases all natural explanations will never be exhausted so we will have to talk about these things in terms of probability and whats most likely and least likely at least at first look its easy to cherry pick after the fact like i said an earlier study about the search for extraterrestrials predicted that we would see these signals and that would be evidence to support the hypothesis thats just science if you look at the sentence it says before you can even invoke extraterrestrials as a possible explanation again thats absurd

Anonymous,2016-11-02T00:14:00.000+02:00,no title,link hey people i always enjoy your threads though i think you focus too much on a singular belief issue or pattern and then it becomes self affirming for you in your research first this but voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness sorry maybe a stress reaction not to be judgmental happens to the best and such just really not what i am trying to convey here though i believe you are quite intelligent i dont think you are qualified exactly to make that wholesale definitive judgement you even contradict that by referencing dr vinods channeling of the nine in  channeling by definition from dictionarycom means in one sense the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing i dont wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because i dont sense this is really what your thread is about but there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people who dont test as schizophrenic or any other dsm related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations indicating mental illness now thats not to say that anyone hearing voices is being technologically harassed but saying definitively its always mental illness does a disservice to the search for knowledge and stopping such technology being used on people link to lawsuit psychotronic weaponsspace preservation acthouse resolution bill brain manipulation from a distance last year in october the congressman dennis j kucinich introduced in the american congress a bill obliging the american president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons in this bill the definition of a weapon system includes any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on or damaging or destroying a person or the biological life bodily health mental health or physical and economic wellbeing of a person through the use of landbased seabased or spacebased systems using radiation electromagnetic psychotronic sonic laser or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war mood management or mind control of such persons or populations  as in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain psychotronic weapons remain at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research in the sphere of science fiction since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication that it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal either sound or visual messages is now generally known this is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies without consent of the user is banned devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life as for the sound a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted appeared last year in the world newspapers the beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill the acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging one of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy though in the open scientific literature only some  experiments were published supporting this assumption  already in  in the ussr after successful testing with military unit in novosibirsk the installation radioson radiosleep was registered with the government committee on the matters of inventions and discoveries of the ussr described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves     dear senatorattorney letter included we seek your offices assistance in initiating hearings and a factfinding congressional inquiry into the government agencies andor private companies that are targeting citizens many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing intrusive and oppressive targeting evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals based on us patent and trademark office filings public releases by agencies and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication the weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism microwaves sonic waves lasers and other types of directed energy and were characterized as psychotronic in rep dennis kucinichs draft of house resolution  the space preservation act of  furthermore it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past for example the cias human experimentation discussed in orlikow v us  fsupp  ddc  secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in united states v stanley  us   and military chemical experimentation as discussed in congressional committee report  d congress d session s prt  dec   lastly the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted including people with postgraduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial however common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports surveillance scenarios harassment techniques and more can be readily established i highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit containing a great deal of verifiable information the military has admitted for some time to having at the least a non lethal lol weapon called active denial but this rabbit hole goes much much deeper having said all that as ive said before in one of your threads i think it wise to consider that its not just one thing or another its many things there could be aliens for instance and then there could be milabs leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction rather than their being used for human experimentation which is supposed to be against our constitution and most certainly against our human rights and then people can also suffer from temporal lobe seizure like hallucinations but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced artificially as well in short i think your rabbit hole is only

reldra,2016-10-27T02:54:48.091+03:00,two powerful quakes hit italy within hours,link years ago i came here for the ufos and after a small amount of time i stopped believing mostly due to nothing being real anymore most stuff is faked at least in my opinion the below is true even if its not as exciting as cgi videos my main reason for posting is about one of the very few times i saw stuff back in summer of july i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west texas with a friend robert my last trip as a single guy before i got married the following month the trip was a lot of canoeing swimming cliff diving snorkeling and camping out at night beneath the stars no tent just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly robert and i were best friends and also worked together too anyway one really really dark chilly and moonless night about pm or so we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good i was  my friend was  he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by boat we used a rental canoe so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being  foot high they seemed a lot taller to me we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another i then saw it and said look right there he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed saw it and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent or semitransparent and faint bluish looking sphere a clear bubble really moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting stuff but then one of us i really cant remember who noticed another one this time coming from the east they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere it wasnt laserlike at all i dont think but it appeared more like a vshaped beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a second and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn westward now going almost the same direction as the one from the east making them both going in the same direction actually the one that got flashed didnt make a  degree turn it was really going more of a path more like westsouthwest more like  degrees or so just guessing now when i say that it turned it turned abruptly not at all anything like any plane would do that struck us both as being odd no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance both staying in a straight line to their intended destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the directions but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard of we hear it all of the time now years ago though it wasnt talked about at all not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years that almost  degree turn to be honest i just didnt understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that night i dont know how long it took us but we did but after a few hours around ish am robert woke me up and said listen and i heard footsteps that scared us pretty good cause we had gotten so worked up earlier i guess heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us well we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep i have to admit ok yeah i did partake myself but only a little bit i wasnt into it like him but i was on vacation that made us both very paranoid i guess anyway the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing the breads plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river they determined that it was a raccoon which they do this sort of thing i know now now to regular people that might not seem like much especially now days here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily still for back then it was really something my older brother by  years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around  in the spring may i think and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers thats all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties after all that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my pickup i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake he being quiet through the entire story he wasnt that talkative really and within  minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one i had my own binoculars this time i was really amazed it was exactly as what i had seen before i mean exactly nothing major happened though it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right and that was that my brother was never a believer anyway maybe had it landed it would change his mind we saw several regular ol satellites afterwards too why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around  lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did with the slightly vshaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away id really love to read that again it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed i say confirmed because that friend robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work we hardly talked about anything else on that trip and especially on the way home too assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work maybe  people i didnt see the harm in telling what we saw after i said my piece i said ask robert robert said i was crazy and he didnt see a thing i thought he was kidding but he was being serious youd think that on the way back hed say that he wasnt wanting to tell anyone but nooo edit on  by recrisp because typo,english,abovetopsecret.com,http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats3.jpg,bs,two powerful quakes hit italy within hours,link years ago came ufos small

Profusion,2016-10-27T02:54:51.356+03:00,russia puzzled by norways decision to host us marines,why isnt observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for ufos page  link eyewitness accounts have been used by science for years newton used eyewtiness accounts in the principia when talking about comets he came up with a theory on comets based on recorded sighting throughout the world like a boy saw a comet and this is what he described there wasnt any internet to even verify the credibility of these eyewitness accounts yet newton used them to come up with a theory about comets which helped lead to his equations of gravity so if eyewitness accounts are so unreliable how did newton use them to come up with his theories we also saw this with meteorites this is from wiki although meteors have been known since ancient times they were not known to be an astronomical phenomenon until early in the th century prior to that they were seen in the west as an atmospheric phenomenon like lightning and were not connected with strange stories of rocks falling from the sky in  yale university chemistry professor benjamin silliman investigated a meteorite that fell in weston connecticut silliman believed the meteor had a cosmic origin but meteors did not attract much attention from astronomers until the spectacular meteor storm of november  people all across the eastern united states saw thousands of meteors radiating from a single point in the sky astute observers noticed that the radiant as the point is now called moved with the stars staying in the constellation leo astute observers saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky and to this day this is still called the radient i thought science never uses eyewitness accounts also heres a list of published papers and studies on ufos this page offers a list of  articles papers and monographs about ufos  uaps published in professional journals and specialty publications two polls of professional  amateur astronomers respectively on whether they see ufos or not finally  phd dissertations and academic publications about ufos very little peerreviewed literature has been published in

extraterrestrial visitation has occurred i have had  sightings myself two looked like probes it was real windy one day and the wind was almost knocking me over then this round orb passed in front of me going against the wind it slowed down and then it sped back up where are all the scientist explaining ufos why are there still these unidentified objects in the sky we have aeriel phenomena in the

for a moment she said she was not quite as cheerful as she had been just minutes ago the october afternoon was cooling off as evening approached and jonathan could see his breath the coach trundled past wellmaintained stone gables and a heavy wroughtiron gate standing open on one side oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog and additional lanterns spilled pools of yelloworange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house eleanor gasped as the massive shape of the house came into view its beautiful jonathan made a surprised hm but otherwise said nothing a welldressed footman dashed out to lower the stairs of their coach and open the door then offered a whitegloved hand to eleanor as she peered out with a flashed smile at jonathan she accepted the young mans hand and descended the driver was speaking quietly with another footman and an older man emerged from the heavy oak door of the house as jonathan descended the

gariac,2016-10-27T11:15:48.078+03:00,tonopah test range google earth imagery,link hello again ats though we are two weeks out from election day as i sit to write these words  i find myself already looking beyond tuesday november the eighth and at some of the things that i think will happen between now and  as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that years election it wont be a popular opinion here on ats i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying that short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event  this years election is very likely a done deal hillary clinton will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day  as of this writing  the metaanalysis of polls shows clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this view i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post  world will look like frankly gazing into my allegorical crystal ball i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of tuesday november the eighth could well be historic  in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has builtup a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our televisions computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment we as a nation will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media twitter to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one donald j trump source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible  given the evidence it is more than likely the probable outcome trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged that they have no voice and that he is the only one who can save them this is a very very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most trump supporters obviously will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race  even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some trump supporters those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling the alt right very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that trump enjoys i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late  and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line blunty put  if election night comes and trump loses  and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago  it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about trump tv many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i dont see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that trumps original thoughts  or more the thoughts of those who influence trump  was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that its now grown into something more i think that trump tv  or whatever they end up calling it  trump tv is too generic theres no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like trumps maga network is probably more on point  will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed  im looking at you sarah palin and glenn beck  by congealing the various patriot tea party and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity  a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that donald trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement  using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night frustrations angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and trump will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a  live streaming show  and trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see trump tv however i dont see trump being the driving force behind the actual message trump is a brand after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didnt build shows that he didnt create and ideas he didnt originate trump works as a spokesperson  the guy who says im not only the president of but im also a member the real people behind the curtain will be the mercers  robert and rebekah  steve bannon and to a lesser degree roger ailes as for on camera talents i think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be hannity oreilly and lahren  though im honestly not personally sure if oreilly will make the jump money is money after all and big daddy bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the fox news heap as his career winds down regardless however of who wins the backstage power war  other than the mercers who are a lock  and the on camera positions the network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and i think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming

childoffather,2016-10-27T09:50:00.000+03:00,more footage of operation high jump with hitler,the moon that fell from heaven page  link there is an intriguing text from anatolian myth with regards to the moon falling from heaven the moon god fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex but no one saw him the storm god sent rain after him he sent rains after him fear seized him anxiety seized him the god hapantali went there he stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell the goddess kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said what in the world has happened here a good question from kamrusepa there then but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isnt really explained so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldnt he the moon be seen having landed my consideration is that the gate complex is that of the cilician gates  and that the moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the taurus mountains with silver that region did relate to the silver mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in silver at kultepekanes the essence of the trade was to ship tin woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire directly or indirectly silver and gold which was shipped back to assur tin essential for the anatoian production of bronze was imported in assur from susa perhaps by elamite caravans and ultimately originated from central asia assyrian trade colony at kanes there are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from kultepe on these sometimes can be seen the taurus bull that bears upon its back the silver mountain also seen beneath on that example is the scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the cilician gates and greater region also the symbol of ishara the goddess of the silver mountain and related to concept idea of the moon within the underworld her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement the temple of ishara being at kanes or nesi to the hurrians there were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then including in cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above taurus in gemini and its opposite point of emergence in scorpio according to the intersection point of the galactic and ecliptic planes were this gets interesting is that there is a hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named the song of silver involving their tutelary god tessub and his ongoing issues with kumarbi god of destiny among tessub the sun god of the sky sauska ninevehs queen and all the gods no one worships him although his power is greater than their power his word is greater than their words his wisdom is greater than their wisdom his battle and his gory are greater than theirs it is silver the fine of whom i sing wise men tod me the story of the fatherless boy it did not exist long ago silvers father had disappeared and they do not know his spendor heroic men ran to battle abundance did not exist and grain did not grow only hunger the songs of the kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to byblos and ebla it is likely the same in this case conflict with the region of nesa and the silver mountains this however relating to a much earlier period potentially also this relates to conflict from the heavens as silver could be named kubbabaranzu as noted here the association with anzu in conflict with tessub relating to the same with ninurta in the sumerian mythos and that seemingly from anatolia the identification of silver as dumu also correlates with the sumerian notion of the divine child as damu often seen as the basis for the cult of dumuzid were it was also the case that the city of dumuzid badtivira was the centre of the sumerian metallurgy industry silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas dumu which means a child whose father is dead or missing hittitologists generally translate this as orphan silvers consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time the song of silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve silver at some point establishing his power silver seized power with his hands silver seized the spear he dragged the sun and moon down from heaven the sun and the moon did reverence they bowed to silver the sun and the moon began to speak to silver o silver our lord do not strikekill us we are the luminaries of heaven and earth we are the torches of what lands you govern if you strikekill us you will proceed to govern the dark lands personally his soul within him was filled with lovehe had pity on them in dragging the sun and the moon down from heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the mountains with gold and silver but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of allani and ishara at the time of silver the spiritual qualities brought down to earth hopefully in the future more complete accounts of these texts will emerge as they are most intriguing and almost completely overlooked apart from

question relating to quantum computing since qubits are what makes up quantum computers that being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on off or both on and off at the same time in usual computing transistors are either on or off in quantum they can be both on and off at the same time the question i have is simply this is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on off and on and off at the same time even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor i mean a normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state if it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state couldnt you make the voltage extra high to get a both onoff at the same time state or half voltage to get the same onoff state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario there might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an onoff state but couldnt it be possible perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both onoff by checking the voltage some how idk please answer me like im a drunk stupid idiot perhaps laymen terms i can be quite the idiot sometimes thanks for hearing me out im currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to darage im sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit but that doesnt really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology which has been highly refined the advantage of the qbit isnt really that it stores more information its that it can be used to process more information at the same time quantum  computing  quantum computing the key features of an ordinary computerbits registers logic gates algorithms and so onhave analogous features in a quantum computer instead of bits a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits which work in a particularly intriguing way where a bit can store either a zero or a  a qubit can store a zero a one both zero and one or an infinite number of values in betweenand be in multiple states store multiple values at the same time if that sounds confusing think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time schrödingers cat being alive and dead or a car being a bicycle and a bus a gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals if you blow on something like a flute the pipe fills up with a standing wave a wave made up of a fundamental frequency the basic note youre playing and lots of overtones or harmonics higherfrequency multiples of the fundamental the wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously theyre added together to make a combined wave that includes them all qubits use superposition to represent multiple states multiple numeric values simultaneously in a similar way just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once so it can process them simultaneously instead of working in serial doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence it can work in parallel doing multiple things at the same time only when you try to find out what state its actually in at any given moment by measuring it in other words does it collapse into one of its possible statesand that gives you the answer to your problem estimates suggest a quantum computers ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer if only we could build it so how would we do that explainthatstuffcom if i understand correctly a quantum computer will just be a smaller more energy

in the midst of deepening tension between us allies nato and russia nato is planning the largest military buildup along the russian border since the cold war 
nato called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort according to reuters  thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks 
it was reported that italy france denmark and other european states are expected to join the nato military divisions that will be led by the united states along russias border 
on wednesday britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to russias borders as part of a huge military deployment 
a total of  troops drones and tanks are moving to estonia as part of the biggest military buildup of nato troops on russias borders since the cold war 
in addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation nato has an army of over  ready to be called up to fight at any time 
the us military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a deterrent to the russian military but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war 
this is a credible deterrence not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg said on tuesday  ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation 
just imagine what would happen if russian troops amassed along the mexican border and told the us that this move was to prevent conflict 
the socalled iskanderm cruise missiles can hit targets across poland and the baltics although nato officials declined to say if russia had moved nuclear warheads to kaliningrad 
the united states envoy to nato douglas lute told reporters that nato and the us military may consider russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of natos deployment this statement is insane considering the fact that the us military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone elses lands 
this deployment if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed would be a change in russias security posture lute said 
if anyone is a threat it is nato and the us government 
these military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in syria in which western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups meanwhile russia has interests in keeping their allies in the syrian government in control putting the two superpowers at odds 
until now russia and the us have been fighting through third parties just as they had during the previous cold war and the same type of situation is developing today

myanmars defacto leader aung san suu kyi of the national league for democracy ndl political party has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy she has not only illegally declared herself leader of the southeast asian state in contravention of its constitution she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with 
during elections earlier this year myanmars constitution prevented suu kyi from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas her status of having been married to a foreign and her childrens dual citizenship instead of adhering to the law her party once in power simply contrived an entirely new post for her state counsellor of myanmar which makes her the defacto leader of myanmar 
canadas the globe and mail in an article titled stéphane dion says aung san suu kyi is the de facto leader of myanmar would note that canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping stating 
dion called suu kyi now myanmars foreign minister the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state 
suu kyi the internationally recognized democracy advocate is barred from becoming president because her late husband was british as are her two sons the rule was crafted during myanmars decades of military rule which suu kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall 
in essence she is unelected and illegally holding power for a woman whos western backers  particularly in the united states and united kingdom  have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both the inhumane humanitarian 
another myth built up around nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi by the west has been her advocacy for human rights her advocacy for human rights however appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned for groups beyond this selfserving political protection and particularly regarding her political opponents she and her ndl are just as eager to jail crush or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been 
in addition to escalating violence targeting the nations rohingyas population several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and westernbacked media fronts and organizations 
myanmars eleven media group emg in its article facebook offender brought to court for insulting suu kyi attempted to distance what suu kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now a simple matter of enforcing the law it would state 
a facebook user named zaw zaw aka nga pha was brought to the north dagon township court on october  to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about state counsellor aung san suu kyi 
he has been charged under section d of the telecommunications law 
hes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the state counsellor posted on facebook said plaintiff nay myo kyaw a yearold resident of north okkalapa township 
around  people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the network of supporters of the rule of law they shouted you deserved it for insulting a good person 
the article also admits 
the myawady township court sentenced aung win hlaing aka a nyar thar the first man to be prosecuted under the current government for defamatory posts on facebook about president htin kyaw to nine months in jail after he was convicted under section d of the telecommunications law 
aung myint tun aka ko pho htaung a member of the national league for democracy is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter 
another man named yar pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake facebook account under the name of nay myo wai the chairman of peace and diversity party 
hla phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on facebook about the commanderinchief 
emg  ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by reporters without borders  would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of myanmars laws to silence its own critics claiming 
eleven media group emg also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on facebook against the group though emg lodged complaints against film director mike tee who is the owner of a facebook account named than tun zaw and another facebook user named myat maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff the legal process has yet to begin emg lodged the complaints on january  and march  this year 
one would expect such a tidal wave of abuse  as defined by the west in regards to media governance and censorship around the world  to be met with sweeping condemnation from the wests various human rights advocacy organizations including human rights watch amnesty international and a no doubt embarrassed reporters without borders  yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling taking over where accused dictators left off 
the wests champions of democracy rule of law and human rights in myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where suu kyi and her ndl party had claimed the militaryled government left off and despite the overt nature of suu kyis breaches of western standards of democracy and human rights the us is on track to lift all sanctions from myanmar as suu kyi and her government open the nation its people and its resources to exploitation by western corporations 
the overt nature of both the wests and suu kyis hypocrisy illustrates that democracy rule of law and human rights are merely facades behind which the west and its proxies wield their power  hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them and in reality such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could  because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the western governments supporting the current regime in myanmar their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime and proxies like suu kyi and her ndl themselves 
international audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the west attempts to overturn other governments in southeast asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric  supporting supposed prodemocracy and prohuman rights advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power

i begin this piece with three quotes from my workinprogress the underground 
there is a media metaphysics its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information now we have a new twist information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it in other words the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a userconsumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event 
information can be dressed up a thousand different ways but it tends to have an elastic quality by that i mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up thats a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press they expose themselves even though they dont want to it takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation this is happening now right in front of our eyes 
the basis of big media is theater news is theater its directors and producers think theyre doing a firstrate job but theyre sadly mistaken gaps and obfuscations are growing larger the outright nonsequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent the audience is wising up to the farce who are these fools who direct the news theyre simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer but that transaction doesnt contain any guarantees about shelf life mainstream news is decaying and the expiration date is approaching like civilizations the petty princes of information rise and fall 
globalized media its nice plan lets examine it 
the new technocratic media is based on profiling users there is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants 
shocking its to be expected how else would technocrats parlay the untold hours theyve spent sizing up their consumersusers 
several years ago i wrote tech blather has already begun since jeff bezos ceo of amazon bought the washington post at a fire sale jeff genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to people on the go and make the post a smashing success mobile devices multiple platforms digital taking over from print ads customized to fit readers interests profiling news stories customized to fit readers interests more profiling 
in other words nonnews if you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before you havent seen anything the new news will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms 
the tech giant apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users yahoo apple news part of the upcoming ios  operating system aims to be the primary news source for users of the iphone and ipad apple says its news app follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests joshua benton of the nieman journalism lab said the app will be important because through the awesome power of default apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league this news app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within  hours of its debut 
translation profiling their users down to their toenails apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read 
not just one overall presentation for all no different news outlets for apples audiences 
this introduces a whole new layer of mind control 
youre an obama fan here are stories confirming your belief in the prophet 
you want neocon on the rocks with a conservative republican twist heres some war footage thatll warm your heart 
do you believe government gridlock is our biggest concern congress cant get anything done weve got headlines for that from here to the moon 
tuned into celeb gossip heres your world in three minutes 
the idea convince users one day at a time that what they already believe is important is the news of the day 
its decentralized centralization one media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and nocontext psyops 
and for fringe users youre doubtful about gmos well look at what whole foods is planning for their healthier produce section cheer up nothing about maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic monsantodow experiments or the dangers of roundup youre antivaccine sorry you dont count youre not a recognized demographic but heres a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the i 
does this sound like science fiction it isnt its the mainstream look of the nearfuture search engines are already personalizing your inquiries us abc national news is climbing in the ratings because its giving viewers lighter stories and spending less time on thorny issues like the middle east 
the mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience and treating every user as a profiled socialconstructbundle of superficial preferences is their answer 
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth 
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands 
the onetwo punch 
any actual event occurring in the world will be predigested by robot media editors and profilers and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences 
who cares what really happened in the new world there is no what really happened thats a gross misnomer a faulty idea a metaphysical error no there is only a multiforked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same eventbecause different viewers want and expect different realities 
in   orwells big brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population that was oldschool that was primitive technology that was achieving unity by hammering unity into peoples skulls this now is the frontier of unity through diversity 
we want to make all of you into androids through basic pr and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education however we recognize youll become different varieties of androids and well serve that outcome with technological sophistication trust us we care about what you prefer 
user a wow did you see the coverage of the border war in chula vista 
user b war they had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there at least a hundred different types and then i watched an old ww movie about aerial combat 
user c chula vista they had a great food show this woman made a lemon pie i could practically taste it 
user d that wasnt a border war it was a drill and then afterwards these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear vests shields communication devices flashbangs auto rifles with silencers batons i watch drills all over the country love them 
user e chula vista the only thing i saw on the news was sunny and mild this week i watch all the weather channels i love them 
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone 
one problem though major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites and by wikileaks and project veritas this attack has exposed the truth and the clinton crimes 
and alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in whats actually happening on many fronts 
the technocratic plan for the news is failing 
it was a nice plan but 
its turning out to be a dud 
alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another hillaryobama support for isis provaccine liars the collapse of obamacare the gmo hustle pesticide damageon and on and on 
the result major media are being backed into a corner where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for everyone all the time the idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing 
major media are playing defense against the rest of the world 
its quite a party 
and it has no expiration date 
a final note trump wikileaks project veritas drudge and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in  raining down on major media it was and is unprecedented the mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots as never before the lying the collusion the arrogant sense of entitlement the desperation the corruptionits all there to see for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells expect more to come regardless of the outcome of the election the train has really left the station

the following is the testimony i will present pro se without a lawyer representing me to the pennsylvania public utility commissions administrative law court november  and   as a result of my not permitting an ami smart meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by peco an exelon company that provides electricity and service to the suburban philadelphia where i live 
this testimony addresses most of the health legal and constitutional issues plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and rfemf cancercausing technology forced on consumers along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an ami smart meter 
there are four parts to the entire testimony that was  pages long plus  pages of exhibits a thru w and other documentation i had in my brief case not presented but as backup if needed that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation published research etc 
personally i think after reading the entire testimony which will appear in four parts readers can understand whats involved with unsafe fireprone and rfemfdirty electricityproducing ami smart meters when for decades utilities provided safe nonplastic parts analog meters before the administrative law court at the pa public utility commission philadelphia pa  november     
your honor judge heep and judge pell members of the pa puc peco energy company the exelon legal team and all interested parties 
since today is the rescheduled postponed june   hearing and for which i catherine j frompovich submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules i have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous  pages  pages of testimony and  pages of exhibits a thru q that i submitted via the us postal service and which all parties received i presume 
however in view of the paramount importance plus dire consequences of emfsrfs being forced onto pennsylvania consumers with no optout for personal safety and protection from  nonionizing radiation emitted by ami smart meters microwave technology and my being a fiveyear breast cancer survivor i submit into testimony and evidence that the pa puc and all participating pennsylvania utilities not just peco as in my case must factor in the american with disabilities act amendments which redefine cancer as a disability especially since there are cancercausing effects from emfsrfs about which i submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of exhibits per the schedule of exhibits i now introduce plus printed documents i have with me in support of the fourpage bibliography of pertinent published literature regarding electromagnetic radiation cancer  ami smart meters that i also submit into the record as exhibit s  
since the ada amendments act provides for three prongs of what constitutes a disability i am submitting into evidence a printout titled americans with disability act amendments act adaaa pointing out appropriate and applicable sections exhibit a  a twopage printout titled ada amendments redefine cancer as a disability exhibit a  along with a page dossier containing about  published studies regarding breast and other cancers and emfelfrf cancer studies exhibit a  and topping off those documents with a twopage letter dated  august  from the foremost emfrf researchers physicians and academics in the world written to the north carolina utilities commission exhibit a wherein in the third paragraph they state 
smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter rfr smart meter rfr consists of frequent very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day because smart meter exposure over a  hour period can be very prolonged  pulses can average  times a day  and because there is building evidence that the sharp high intensity pulses are particularly harmful  the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters 
those five researchers david carpenter md director institute for health and the environment university of albany dr lennart hardell md phd professor department of oncology university hospital orebro sweden dr magda havas bsc phd environmental  resources studies trent university canada dr martha herbert md phd assistant professor of neurology harvard medical school pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at the massachusetts general hospital boston dr sam milham md mph former chief epidemiologist washington state department of health 
point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph  it is imperative that the north carolina utilities commission be fully aware of the harm that rfr can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty 
frompovich respectfully points out and also cautions the pa puc that in not permitting opt outs from ami smart meters in pennsylvania during formulating its ami sm regulations since hb stated ami sms were not to be mandated  it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe ami sms regarding the rfrs they emit various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing ami sms opt outs which the pa puc deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding ami sms thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which in essence violate the nuremberg code since consumers consent was not required nor asked and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on pecos customers 
again frompovich points to the letter addressed to the ncuc exhibit a at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the us ntp june  study conclusion in part stating adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer  
frompovich further elaborates that cell phone rfr exposure is elective  ie depending upon personal choice use and an individuals ability to turn off cell phones thereby reducing andor avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and rfrs exposures both cell phones and ami sms produce 
however harmful personal bodily rfr exposure has been mandated by pa puc regulationsnot hbact   and therefore is absolutely illegal since act  does not defy nor negate the pennsylvania state constitutions inherent rights of mankind section  but its the commonwealths regulatory agencythe pa pucthat is guilty of nonfulfillment i allege 
all men and women are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and reputation  and of pursuing their own happiness  pennsylvania constitution section  
however contrary to that pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated ami smart meter rfr exposure because of no opt outs in pennsylvania specifically via pa puc regulations not act  literally provides no way to escape andor avoid ami sms microwave rfrs that is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally frompovich contends furthermore the pa puc overstepped its agency powers and frompovich contends is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process 
the above five researchers exhibit a delineate cell phone and smart meters as basically the same animal because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum see paragraph  of their letter to the ncuc for more detail including that smart meters over a hour period can average  pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as dirty electricity  
i submit into the record exhibit a dirty electricity or dirty power and the page report why are electromagnetic fields dangerous  is dirty electricity making you sick including  charts  table  ranking electric meters and table  ranking electric meters for risk of privacy and cyber security from the page report ranking electricity meters for risk to health privacy and cyber security available online at httpswwwscribdcomdocrankingelectricitymetersforrisktohealthprivacyandcybersecurity  
the key dispute and multifaceted issue of concern in frompovichs case  being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years  is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear exposure to cancercausing emfs andor actuality of contracting cancer due to ami sm rfr exposures  in her homesomething that the ada amendments act indisputably encompass since once a cancer patient that makes frompovich covered within one of the adaaa prongs for all time and also includes frompovichs indefeasible right to protect property both her home and her personal body and its life processes including her reputation 
that federal adaaa must be factored into frompovichs case since peco has obtained federal grant monies to implement its ami smart meters rollout and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the adaaa including state regulatory agencies like the pa puc 
frompovichs refusal of an ami sm plus her human and innate right to protect her health body and property are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out  the strongest evidence for hazards coming from rfr is cancer  there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity ehs see paragraph  of the letter to ncuc exhibit a  
on page  paragraph  of that same letter the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental if not predictable  variances as per the chart i raise up and submit into the record  a doublesided poster radiofrequency research does funding matter which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics 
nonindustry studies indicate  harmful effects with  no effects while industry studies indicate   harmful effects with  no effects statistically thats almost a wash as each just about cancels the other however theres a slight edge of  from nonindustry studies indicating harmful effects more interestingly though is that industry studies did find  harmful effects studiesalmost onethird of the studies and yet the industry concludes differently stating there are none that alone should be a red flag for them or anyone of scientific mind to investigate further and they did not which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out is that a crime of omission or collusion 
paragraph  on page  of that letter exhibit a cites the obvious crux of scientific and ethical issues regarding ami smart meters in pennsylvania in particular stating with a leading nc dhhs staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance the dhhs conclusion is not surprising 
frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred and still occurs with and from peco and the pa puc thereby illegally depriving frompovich and all pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental ami smart meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize nonthermal adverse health effects from rfrs which have been known since  i introduce exhibit t electrosensitivity es and electromagnetic hypersensitivity ehs into the record to document that in    and  various health issues have been identified with emf nonthermal exposures 
your honors i respectfully ask the court to instruct peco to produce the experimental studies rather than epidemiological studies indicating no nonthermal effects from emfsrfs wheres the science 
arent pecos customers entitled to have that evidence 
frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following how much influence did the microwave industry contribute to pa state representative robert godshalls campaign coffers andor his preferred charities that apparently has enabled godshall as chair of the pa house consumer affairs committee to sit on opt out bills in the pa legislature for several legislative sessions including godshalls verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fireprone ami sms in pennsylvania 
heres what other us states have done regarding ami smart meters 
analog meters are definitively offered as the optout meter in four states arizona california maine and texas the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog 
three states offer the existing meter as the optout meter an existing meter might or might not be analog georgia hawaii and consumers energy in michigan 
three states let the utility decide florida maryland and nevada the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog 
four states or utilities definitively forbid analog optouts fountain in colorado dte in michigan central hudson valley in new york amr and port angeles in washington touted as the first place to ban smart metersnot much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home

Activist Post,2016-11-03T19:17:10.165+02:00,us war in afghanistan silently slips into the abyss,"by catherine j frompovich 
this is the continuation of the testimony i will present before the pennsylvania public utility commissions administrative law court november  and   
currently chairman representative godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights especially of redress to government and also according to the pennsylvania constitution i contend 
probably nothing encapsulates and explains the emfrfr controversy or conundrum if you may from a scientific viewpoint than the page report  europaem emf guideline  for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of emfrelated health problems and illnesses  which is a spanish language document and found online at httpslistasumessympaarcanunciosmsghtml this report cites  published scientific references which leaves frompovich to question why the pa pucand peco in particularare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the s era safety thermal science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ancient radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of safety 
those safety studies originated in germany during world war ii are totally outmoded but remain the present federal communications commissions rules regarding safety of cell phones and ami smart meters it is now  how come s microwave technology science is being applied as the gold standard or scientific criterion to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the internet of things frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both peco and the pa puc for depending upon  science in todays technology world of  wheres the science later than the s please may i have those studies peco supplied to the pa puc 
frompovich therefore respectfully suggests that the pa puc study the aboveaforementioned european reports with medical and ehs health professionals who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed in order to issue updated regulations affecting ami smart meters and their continuous rfremf healthdamaging electromagnetics plus their fireandexplosionprone proclivities and occurrences which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters 
children are the most vulnerable to emf radiation and therefore i introduce exhibit u why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults the consequences and exhibit u american academy of pediatrics august   letter urging the food and drug administration commissioner the federal communications commission and others to advise the public about specific absorption rates sars regarding emfrf exposures 
also i want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity ehs is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ecopsychology professor pamela reed gibson states the following  of the usa population  of the swedish population  of the danish population and   of the german population are ehs compromised see exhibit v  however other sources claim that as much as  of the entire worlds population is affected 
just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or multiple chemical sensitivity mcsso too is ehs now being recognized by many including the world health organization i introduce exhibit w electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment printout available here httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidforumssrcidmdgxodkwotknjuotuodqwntybmtuntizmdamtqxntynzintcbtvrzdgfeounbuufkataumqebdji 
as exhibit x i introduce a study no one can refute a review on electromagnetic fields emfs and the reproductive system which outlines science the microwave industry peco and all utilities utilizing ami smart meters plus public utility commissions across the usa need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics  from dirty electricity pulsed by ami sms onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with ami smart meters 
before i include my previously submitted testimony i find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be frompovichs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt especially in light of the ada amendments act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not since the adaaa provides frompovich with disability rights and protections which peco and the pa puc must abide by 
furthermore it should be the indisputable duty of peco and all pennsylvania utility companies  but more specifically that of the pa public utility commissions stated mission for being  to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with  certainty which ami smart meters fail on numerous levels especially with their proclivity for hot sockets fires and explosions emfrf constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as  times a day 
no medicalscientific testing has proved ami smart meters emfs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that i know of wheres the science 
therefore frompovich should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone ami smart meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high rfr pulses every fifteen seconds 
just to add more salt to the wound as they would say there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the ami smart meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the internet of things or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to peco the pa puc or any government agencies or agents 
therefore frompovich feels her privacy as well as her home and personal physiology will be subjected to unlawful unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and specifically without proper legal processes eg courtissued warrants in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway zigbee radio transmitter system of ami sms and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the internet of things the times frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own 
ive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively  including technologies since the late s during my career i was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislaturelegislative hearings on health issues for numerous years i was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet nutrition epigenetics and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles 
i am in my  th year thank god since the early s when i almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle ive beaten the odds including being a breast cancer survivor using holistic healthcare modalities for the record  of us adults and  of us children used whats referred to as cam in  per nih statistics complementary and alternative medicinecam as its called is popular throughout the world while in the us there is the national center for complementary and integrative health at the national institutes of health 
however the allopathic paradigm considers it quite frankly a pain in its professional butt since cam has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one 
therefore i expect that i probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers wifi smart gadgets and in particular ami smart meters which are being bullyforced onto electric natural gas and municipal water utility customers most state legislators the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health fortunately i am not one of those people thus my refusing an ami smart meter on my house but first i think you ought to know some of my background im a wellinformed plus over  years published consumer health researcher advocateactivist journalist and author 
that i should be taken seriously i offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the us congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national coalition for alternatives in nutrition and healthcare canah for five years and as such presented fdasolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its  ota report otah ntis pb unconventional cancer treatments  expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the us food and drug administration the first government relations specialist for the life extension foundation who set up lefs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on amazoncom and my  book eat to beat disease foods medicinal qualities 
additionally i wrote and produced two tv shows one called  turn off the violence  was nominated for a telly award that hourlong show was instrumental in securing the giraffe award given to persons who stick out their necks for the common good the recipient was george mason university staff member connie kirkland who founded a hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence what ive shared is much less than half of my background more would take too much of your time however i feel compelled to ask how many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues 
furthermore i want to underscore upfront that if i were a habitual drug addict rather than an informed concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health i probably would be welcomed with open arms plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help because i am opposing faulty and healthdamaging rfemf science plus vestedinterest snooping surveillance and customer data marketing agendas using ami smart meters i am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full that leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct especially in the usa if i have to do that 
attorney ward smiths interrogatory requesting frompovichs cancer health records quite frankly leaves everyone with whom ive shared that fact totally aghast and amazed why because frompovichs medical records are her personal information protected under hippa and i must protect them furthermore since the puc administrative law court hearing is of public record frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings as that is her fundamental right 
i respectfully bring to this courts attention that my breast cancer and medical records are not the issue whats the issue problem and at stake not only for me but for all pennsylvanians is the total callous disregard by utility companiespeco included the pa puc and the commonwealth for health hazards safety and the wellbeing of all pennsylvanians especially those with health issues compromised immune systems disabilities and especially young growing childrenfetuses in particularwhom rfemf and dirty electricity produced by ami smart meters affect and impact negatively 
before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsnot s vintage radar safety researchfor rfsemfs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health i feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the ami smart meter hidden costs continuum  and that is healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from nonionizing radiation rfsemfs smart meters impact upon human tissue 
there are mounting underlying longterm adverse health effects accruing as we speak from pa pucpeco forced ami smart meter  rfemf electromagnetics pulses harmonics and dirty electricity specifically adverse nonthermal health effects impacting children and an ageing pa population which will generate dire fiscal consequences plus responsibilities upon penna medicaid health cost line items in each years operating budget for the commonwealth 
to cement that forewarning i offer the world health organizations statistic approximately  of reported cases of ehs electromagnetic hypersensitivity were considered severe which means specialized caregiving that however does not include cancerinduced health issues from rfsemfs what kind of budget shortfall will ami smart meters adverse health effects eventually generate for pas legislature and governor to haggle about when weve seen whats been going on recently to get a state budget passed has anyone thought about that very real problem

Activist Post,2016-11-05T16:50:46.736+02:00,what can the mass checkin at standing rock tell us about online advocacy,"by whitney webb 
over the course of this years us presidential election which has been nothing if not bizarre some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment leading to a suspension of the november election now these theories appear to have more credence as sources within us intelligence have contacted pat milton a cbs news senior investigative producer warning him that terrorist attacks in three us states are highly likely come this monday the day before the us election us intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al qaeda not isis could be planning attacks in new york texas and virginia no specific locations within those three states were mentioned 
us authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously though cbs news  sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed according to cbs  counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an abundance of caution 
earlier this week there were also warnings that polling places could be seen as attractive targets for lone wolf attackers by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies sovereign citizen or other extremist activity this has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worstcase scenarios one fbi official told cbs  
the counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and wellpostured to defend against attacks here in the united states the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety 
however whats interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al qaeda as opposed to the islamic state in the syrian civil war the us has been actively helping al qaeda there grouping their syrian branch  the al nusra front  in with the moderate rebels they support therefore al qaedas ability to launch attacks within the us has been directly aided by us intelligence making this announcement incredibly suspect 
its also worth pointing out that al qaeda since its inception has been a product of the us intelligence community in the s they were essentially created by the us to fight the soviets in afghanistan ever since they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of us wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically 
it is also interesting that the threat is al qaeda and not the islamic state the islamic state has been the terrorist bogeyman of recent years and their involvement in any threat real or imagined is useful justification for escalating us involvement in syria it seems highly likely that the islamic state was left out due to recent revelations from wikileaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the clinton foundation 
it is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass it will be a big help for hillary hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to wikileaks near constant releases of her campaign chairs emails but also due to the fbis mutiny which led them to reopen a probe into clintons use of a private email server any terror attack would give clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in syria and the rest of the middle east 
however as mentioned at the beginning of this article it is also possible that a terrorist attack on us soil would give president obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances unfortunately only time will tell which theory is correct compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime

Activist Post,2016-11-05T17:30:36.699+02:00,smart meter case testimony before the pennsylvania public utility commission what no one wants to acknowledge about emf damage part  of,"by joseph jankowski 
an organization which has the aim to separate the state of california from the union of the united states is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in sacramento on wednesday november   the day after the presidential election 
the yes california independence campaign  which is based in san diego describes itself as a nonviolent campaign to establish the country of california using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so 
the group is currently trying to qualify a citizens initiative in  to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in  reports sf gate  they will be in sacramento in hopes to gather support for the states exit or the calexit as they call it 
in our view the united states of america represents so many things that conflict with californian values and our continued statehood means california will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment and to the detriment of our children reads yes california s official website 
the groups page reads on 
although charity is part of our culture when you consider that californias infrastructure is falling apart our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities poverty rates remain high income inequality continues to expand and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today now is not the time for charity however this independence referendum is about more than california subsidizing other states of this country it is about the right to selfdetermination and the concept of voluntary association both of which are supported by constitutional and international law
it is about california taking its place in the world standing as an equal among nations we believe in two fundamental truths  california exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world and  california could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a us state 
yes california s website lays out  different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a california exit from the us including education peace and security debt and taxes and immigration 
one blog post on their page draws parallels with a calexit and the recent referendum known as brexit that passed in the uk in june which showed that most british people are ready for their country to leave the eu 
the push for secession is nothing new to california in  the mayor of port orford oregon gilbert gable proposed the idea to push the oregon counties of curry josephine jackson and klamath to join with the california counties of del norte siskiyou and modoc to form a new state later named jefferson 
modoc county of northern california voted in  to join neighboring siskiyou county in a push to secede from the state of california  
in  two counties in northern california petitioned for the right to form a st state of america which they also wanted to name jefferson

breaking leaked  memo from attorney kumiki gibson to clinton foundation chairman bruce lindsay gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the foundations practices 
below are key quotes from gibsons findings keep in mind that the clinton foundations very existence depends on it being legally certified as a nonprofit entity in compliance with laws governing nonprofits break those laws and its nonprofit status would be revoked and the whole operation would go down the drain 
gibson important responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the foundation cfo who appears to delegate them to an outside organization with very little oversight by the legal department as a result the foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules including in new york which requires the foundation to be certified to do business in the state apparently the clinton foundation was not legally registered as a nonprofit in new york 
gibson no matter what the leadership decides about the larger overarching question it must act immediately to bring the foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern notforprofits and must create strong legal and hr offices so to prevent any lapses in the future 
gibson the foundation does not have a record retention policy and the procedures currently utilized in harlem headquarters may violate the law 
zero hedge writes furthermore and more troubling the gibson review pointed to a highranking but unnamed foundation executive who was being paid by president clinton the government and the foundation who allowed the foundation to host what may have been or may have been viewed as a political event apparently without official preapproval from the foundations legal department and without regard before the fact to the impact of that decision on the foundations tax exempt status 
this memo was written in  it would have taken then and it would now take about a month of investigation by new york state and us dept of justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the clinton foundation 
that didnt happen then will it happen now not if the dept of justice has anything to say about it the clintons are protected 
but evidence of the foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire some fires are impossible to contain

san francisco california  the adobo chronicles san francisco bureau  now it can be told  now that hillary clinton is all but assured of the democratic presidential nomination 
for months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid her campaign logo has always symbolized americas quest to move forward with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right lefthanded people of course dispute that symbolism because for them moving forward should be pointing to the left 
but there is another school of thought about hillarys logo many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the conservative right as opposed to the liberal left 
the logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the democrats win over republican voters in the general elections  voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate

in last issue of black agenda report i argued that readers should vote for the green party this november this week i will outline what to expect from a hillary clinton presidency the great migration of republicans into the democratic party tent of hillary clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic us presidential elections corporate media outlets have collaborated with clinton to instill deep popular fear of a trump administration fear of trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the us who are fed up with both corporate parties this has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once hillary clinton actually takes office
the corporate media has exploited the general populations distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist it is critical that the left in the us extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day however trumps vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of hillary clinton his characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a clinton presidency
one could endlessly debate clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim trumps vulgar and putrid presentation has provided clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the  elections it is reasonable to assume that a hillary clinton presidency will be far less effective than obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony this is why her support system the entire ruling class has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a russiatrump collaborative threat in every sphere of us political life
here are ten things to expect from a clinton presidency i will leave it to readers to judge as to whether clinton represents a lesser evil than trump or just plain evil
 the privatization of social security  hillary clinton has stated publicly and privately to her wall street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program wikileaks exposed clintons support for the obamas administrations deficit reduction commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as social security and medicare in  clinton donors on wall street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of social security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit
more hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil john pilger clinton policies will bring great aggression to the us and the world  world war iii  hillary clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a nofly zone in syria that means us airstrikes would rain down on syrian and russian assets in syria such a move would place the us military in direct confrontation with the russia clinton has been caught stating that the syrian and russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits
 the transpacific partnership  often called nafta on steroids the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of asia pacific region has been a major talking point in the  elections clinton has supported the agreement in the past only to switch her position due to pressure from the bernie sanders campaign with sanders firmly in the clinton camp there is currently nothing in the way to stop clinton from moving forward with the tpps passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality
 maintenance and expansion of the surveillance state  not much needs to be said here the obama administrations vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of ed snowden and julian assange wikileaks additionally revealed clintons desire to drone julian assange for releasing washingtons secrets to the public a clinton presidency has every intention of following up on the obama administrations passage of bills such as the national defense authorization act of  this bill gave the us government the right to militarily detain terror suspects indefinitely
 trumps wall  hillary clinton was obamas secretary of state from  over this time she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in us history furthermore she oversaw the detention of thousands of central american children during the great migration from the  fascist coup in honduras a coup that was drawn up by clinton herself the usmexico border is more militarized than it has ever been trumps wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current us immigration policy
 servitude to the bankers  hillary clinton has received over forty million in support from hedge funds in the  elections before selling out bernie sanders made it a point to request public access into clintons private quarter million dollar speeches to banks like goldman sachs the deregulation of the banks with the passage of the glasssteagall act was a clinton project both her current list of donors and past connection to her husbands policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class
 maintenance of the mass black incarceration state  hillary clinton is the enemy of black america from her callous use of the term super predator to describe working class black men to being the architect of the  crime bill the clinton dynasty virtually built the mass black incarceration state under bill and hillary clintons two terms the prison population rose by  this was facilitated by draconian three strikes laws mandatory drug sentence and the deep militarization of local police departments with her record it isnt too difficult to assume what another four years of clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons
 austerity and more austerity  it was the first clinton administration that eliminated welfare as we know it the evisceration of aid to families and dependent children afdc and its replacement temporary assistance to needy families tanf threw millions of women and children into poverty obama has followed up with draconian cuts to snap foodstamps there is nothing on clintons track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the us
 a boost to the privatization of education  hillary clinton received boos in july when she urged teachers unions and charter operators to work together for the greater good of students ever since clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education but that hardly matters clinton receives broad support from school privatizers like walmart and should not be expected to roll back the shock and awe war on public education waged by the obama administration
 an economic crisis  bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of  capitalists everywhere were given free rein to recover with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in  the internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates whether clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well obama has remains to be seen
clinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than donald trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class the question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the twoparty corporate duopoly jill stein and ajamu baraka are attempting to build the base of the green party ticket whatever method is chosen it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a clinton

Daniel Haiphong,2016-10-27T03:00:00.000+03:00,things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency," shares
   
as donald trump gains more bad press hilary clinton rides the political wave with quick responses deflections and denials without question and largely due to trumps obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious glenn beck she is without question a wolf in sheeps clothing while trump is unbelievably hard to take constantly we need to focus on one simple question which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first
i suspect it would be hillary clinton who would be most inclined toward involving americans in another military conflict and she doesnt go small as she constantly demonizes russia with threats of military action in clintons own words youve seen reports russia has hacked into a lot of things china has hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems so weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses
military responses to a nation the us stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades military response against russia over suspected hacking hillary clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with donald trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences
it all stems from the wikileaks release that included  emails and  attachments from leaders at the democratic national committee clinton says the russians did it the national mainstream media parroted those words its the american medias political conditioning system at its finest convincingly reaching tens of millions of americans and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the russians in a usa today article from july  elizabith weise wrote computer security researchers say its difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the democratic national committee subsequently posted online by wikileaks was the work of russian hackers as some media outlets have reported
russias leader vladmir putin says the us long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction well before the cold war even ended peace with russia should be a top priority for any us presidential candidate the truth is that american politicians perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves created a road block on the highway to peace during the vietnam war putin said during the st petersburg international economic forum  it is not in my nature to scold someone  but when the united states unilaterally withdrew from the abm treaty in  they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security that was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world
more  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil now we have clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations
world rivals in the air
there is a decadesold history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology while american designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better the fastest jet fighter ever made is the russian mig it can break mach iii more than three times the speed of sound such demands lessen the life of an aircraft the mig is typically not flown at anything close to that speed as an interceptor however it was supreme no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it
the korean war was the first test soviet migs initially dominated the skies with russian and chinese pilots often at the controls the migs were deadly
on  november  at least sixteen american f fighters p mustangs were shot at by six soviet mig interceptors led by soviet wwii ace mayor nikolay v stroykov the wwii prop planes like the mustang along with the us f shooting star and f thunderjet jet fighters had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable mig fighters
everything changed when the us air force launched the f sabre wikipedia explains that the f sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six  caliber machine guns which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target f pilots were also equipped with gsuits which prevented pilot blackout in highspeed turning maneuvers
it is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and kill ratios over mig alley during the korean war
the soviets claimed  united nations planes of all types shot down including about  sabres the usaf only admits to losing less than  aircraft in air combat
the f pilots claimed  migs shot down while b gunners claimed a further  these numbers were later reduced to  migs the chinese air force claimed only  kills
in vietnam the competitors varied the mig and mig fighters were widely used by the north vietnamese air force they fought planes like the f super sabre f tiger and the f phantom once again if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part the us planes dominated in most air to air combat though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the americans during the end of the cold war in the s the soviet mig was the terror of the skies there was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first while mig aircraft were only built in odd numbers the movie top gun references the aircraft by calling them migs  migs no ones been this close before the planes used in the movie were actually american f tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails today the united states spends obscene amounts on planes like the f raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern russian planes like the su both in this case are capable of thrust vectoring which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight the ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the avb harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war but with clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the us used to hold over the russian military have evaporated into thin air
russias modern approach to warfare
during the decadeslong cold war the soviet union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander or a pilot from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order kemp freund a us army sergeant major that i met while i was covering the war in afghanistan was quote d in my  video report camp joyce remote fire base near afghanistanpakistan border saying were trying to break the old soviet methods that they use and the soviet method had that lt col completely in the dark until he needed to move he added were still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill the soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now todays russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than us taxpayer funded military planes they also utilize tactics of western pilots hillary clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another war president which was so important to former president george w bush and obama too for that matter
other looming conflicts
lest we forget hillary clintons unwavering support of israel the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by us taxpayer money and military hardware the government of right wing israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of palestinians constantly while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law then there are the attacks in gaza that target schools and hospitals leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured never does clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment israel reserves for nonjews never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call iran hasnt attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years yet iran has been savagely attacked by

the anarchist political observer noam chomsky has over the years espoused a strategy of voting for the democrat in swing states recently chomsky with john halle propounded  an eight point brief for lev lesser evil voting 
chomsky questions the ethicalmoral principle rejecting lev since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil as futile as lesser evilism is it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser evilism between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the united states lev in fact is an equally contemptible or greater evil
chomsky though sensibly cautions that challenges to the politicalbusiness duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences what are the possible consequences chomsky suggests a trump presidency should it materialize will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the sanders campaign particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right however another consequence is equally possible a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist democrat andor it might finally cause former or potential democrats to reject the chicanery of the businessdominated democrats and embrace the progressivist platform of the green party
this costbenefit strategic accounting seriously pushes for progressivist change
focusing on the electoral system however must not be the endall and beall for bringing about progressivism in the us grassroots organizing and activism must continue to inform oppose poverty and impoverishment oppose war and violence and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people  during electoral periods and between election cycles

 voting should not be viewed as a form of personal selfexpression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites
no argument with this
 the exclusive consequence of the act of voting in  will be if in a contested swing state to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning
this is true of the individual act of voting the individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result that is an obvious given however when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of likeminded individuals then enormous potentials emerge this desire for a change from the effete status quo is arguably what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of bernie saunders and it is also what happened in a dissimilar manner with the candidacy of donald trump chomsky has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action and it is but individuals can and do at times form a wider consciousness measurable by statistically rigorous polling results that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins an example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the canadian federal election of  following two successive majority governments led by the brian mulroney tories a voting tsunami washed away all but two tory seats in the seat parliament the conservatives had been around since  but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the tories
 one of these candidates trump denies the existence of global warming calls for increasing use of fossil fuels dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to india and other developing nations as called for in the paris agreement the combination of which could in four years take us to a catastrophic tipping point trump has also pledged to deport  million mexican immigrants offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted african american protestors at his rallies stated his openness to using nuclear weapons supports a ban on muslims entering the us and regards the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood while having done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich hence shredding what remains of the social welfare safety net despite pretenses
much of what trump stands for is anathema true there is no need to defend this man however trump stakes out important positions diametrical to hillary clinton for example clintons advocacy of a nofly zone over syria her saber rattling with russia her corporatefriendly policy toward socalled free trade deals
chomsky cleverly anticipated such an objection writing
 with respect to point  which some will challenge by citing the claim that clintons foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of trump
in any case while conceding as an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement furthermore insofar as this is the fact of the matter following the logic through seems to require a vote for trump though its a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously
first chomsky concedes an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable in other words chomsky posits an inside possibility one assumes that chomsky is saying that there is the strongest likelihood that clintons foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so second he raises an unreasonable demand for evidence that trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than clinton given that trump has never held political office no such evidence exists what does exist is plenty of evidence that clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy there is no reason to assume clinton would reduce the number of american military bases overseas or curtail military spending in fact it is likelier that she would increase military spending she will also likeliest resort to a us military attack to bring about regime change in syria pushing the us closer to military confrontation with russia trumps detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to clintons rhetoric but toward putin or assad clintons undiplomatic utterances are on record
moreover following chomskys logic while the more preferable policies of trump lack evidence by the same token the more objectionable policies of trump also lack evidence for the same reason trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the oval office thus following this chomskyian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of trumps pronouncements would he really build a wall on the mexicous border where is the evidence for this would trump really ban muslims from entering the us where is the evidence for this
by effectively undermining trumps peacemongering visàvis clintons warmongering chomsky by the same logic undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by trump thus following chomskys logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously
 the suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a clinton presidency
one assumes that chomsky refers to the domestic population here trumps policies  if he is true to his word to protect jobs for american workers and punish offshoring of american jobs along with his opposition to the tpp  would be a political reversal for neoliberalization clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad the economic plight of students the poor and ill however would be much better under a jill stein presidency 
the economic plight of students the poor and ill would be much better under a jill stein presidency
if chomsky is referring to the preponderant violence of us foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations then i agree with his basic moral principle not only must we take responsibility for our actions but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves under the democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died millions of people have been displaced and terrorist organizations have proliferated this is the evidence from clintons time in political office thus a vote for clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation perhaps even a ramping up of the suffering of others basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppressionenabling vote
 should constitute sufficient basis to voting for clinton where a vote is potentially consequentialnamely in a contested swing state
i contend that chomskys basis for  is false or questionable first chomsky has staunchly argued that we should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over but it seems that chomsky believes that trump will supersede clintons record of killing in iraq libya and syria clinton is not going to close us military abroad trump has called these bases into question and if one concentrates on the domestic population at least the rhetoric of trump against socalled free trade agreements and offshoring us factories abroad bodes well for the american worker
 however the left should also recognize that should trump win based on its failure to support clinton it will repeatedly face the accusation based in fact that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a trump administration
this criticism is antidemocratic furthermore the criticism applies conversely chomskys citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the businessparty duopoly the records of the bill clinton and barack obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale clinton deregulated the finance sector exposed american workers to the vagaries of free trade implemented regressive welfare policies and continued aggressive us militarism abroad obama bailing out the banks attempts to cut back social security warring in afghanistan libya yemen and syria drone strikes confrontation with russia and china tpp and the lingering incarceration at guantanamo bay it is important to note that democrats arguably have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than republicans have since many supporters of democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the republicans george bush was stymied from tinkering with social security notably obama has done an aboutface on social security and proposed an expansion picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the bernie saunders candidacy
 often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it they will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels with the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left challenge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties with the political establishment rather than breaking with it as they must
it is true that establishment operatives will use lev as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it that was the case when ralph nader ran it is the case when cynthia mckinney ran and it is when jill stein runs the corporate media and even many socalled progressives will trot out this timeworn argument with each election cycle as long as enough people buy into the premise then the status quo will persist the result is that a rightwing government always assumes office in washington this bodes ill for the poor and working class it bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the us
 conclusion by dismissing a lesser evil electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for clintons defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve
conclusion by buying into a lesser evil electoral logic the corporatepolitical duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the  and their goals for further enrichment to unfetter finance to pursue a belligerent foreign policy  a policy that seeks to placate the militaryindustrial establishment and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system all of this is at crosshairs with what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve
final comments
the tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil
some leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism  i found that to be preposterous barack obama was the socalled lesser evil the previous two election cycles obama is not a lesser evilist he is the man who enables evil  the cycles of usbacked violence and killing in places such as gaza syria bahrain afghanistan yemen and somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism if one votes for a degree of evil then one should not be surprised when evil results
progressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed a genuine peacemongering us president is needed to stop the killing and save lives consequently both democrats and republicans are anathema given the present candidates if people vote then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions
only a propeace third party will set the us on a new path  outside of a revolution the election of a propeace third party is the only moral direction on the horizon for americans truly interested in steering their country toward peace and rehabilitating the ensanguined us reputation such a third party vote however may well augur the birth of a revolution on many promising

according to the syrian dissidents news website enab muhaysini has released a video recently in which he appreciated riyadh and other arab states for equipping his comrades with missiles
the saudi preacher said that the missiles that they have sent would be used to break the syrian army and its allies siege of aleppo
he also thanked turkey for supporting the terrorists and treating the wounded militants in its hospitals
jaish alfatah is a conglomerate of terrorist groups with alnusra fatah alsham front comprising its main body
in relevant remarks in june a source said that saudi arabia has sent new cargoes of weapons and financial aid to the terrorists in aleppo in northern syria to strengthen them against the syrian army and its allies fresh attacks

to this end riyadh has sent one of its ranking officers to the regions controlled by terrorists in northern aleppo to supply them with money and arms to intensify attacks and open new fronts against the syrian army and popular forces the source added
also a prominent syrian military analyst said earlier this month that the terrorists in aleppo take orders from outside and dont dare to leave the city in anticipation of punishment by saudi arabia and turkey
violation of the ceasefire by the terrorists and their opposition to the evacuation of aleppo is of no surprise as they are not the ones in charge of the decisionmaking for remaining or leaving the city rather they take orders from the regional and international sides for whom they are working turki hassan told fna last saturday
noting that the main cause of the terrorists stubborn stay in aleppo is that leaders of fatah alsham formerly known as alnusra front and ahrar alsham are afraid of punishment by their qatari saudi and turkish masters he said if they move in defiance of their qatari saudi and turkish lords they might be killed and their properties be seized",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/ISIS_Electrocution_6072b.jpg,bs,isis executes civilians electrocution central mosul,abdullah muhammad almuhaysini senior al qaedalinked cleric religious leader jeish alfatah terrorist group admitted militants syria received financial military aid saudi arabia certain persian gulf arab states shares according syrian dissidents news website enab muhaysini released video recently appreciated riyadh arab states equipping comrades missiles saudi preacher said missiles sent would used break syrian army allies siege aleppo also thanked turkey supporting terrorists treating wounded militants hospitals jaish alfatah conglomerate terrorist groups alnusra fatah alsham front comprising main body relevant remarks june source said saudi arabia sent new cargoes weapons financial aid terrorists aleppo northern syria strengthen syrian army allies fresh attacks hear humanitarian crisis aleppo everywhere else syria maintaining assad least worst option criminal wests state sponsorship terrorism israel wants syria destroyed presaged oded yinon plan saudi regime recently sent small arms new equipment including drones terrorists syria source said end riyadh sent one ranking officers regions controlled terrorists northern aleppo supply money arms intensify attacks open new fronts syrian army popular forces source added also prominent syrian military analyst said earlier month terrorists aleppo take orders outside dont dare leave city anticipation punishment saudi arabia turkey violation ceasefire terrorists opposition evacuation aleppo surprise ones charge decisionmaking remaining leaving city rather take orders regional international sides working turki hassan told fna last saturday noting main cause terrorists stubborn stay aleppo leaders fatah alsham formerly known alnusra front ahrar alsham afraid punishment qatari saudi turkish masters said move defiance qatari saudi turkish lords might killed properties seized,1,,,,,

the saudi interior ministry on sunday announced that four men were arrested over plans to detonate a bomb at the king abdullah sports city stadium during or after an october  world cup qualifier match against united arab emirates in the city of jeddah the suspects were arrested one day before the match which gathered over  fans
isis wants any operation that could result in the highest number of victims said interior ministry spokesman major general mansour alturki
a security official general bassam attiyah said a vehicle carrying around  kilograms of explosives was found near the stadium he added that the suspects had planned to either target people in the stadiums parking lot or fans watching the match

Harun Yahya,2016-10-30T02:00:00.000+02:00,gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads,"bill clinton and his cabinet members pursued antiindia activities and as secretary of state hillary did the same as president she will no doubt continue to bully india  shares
   
there are only weeks left until we find out if we have a president trump or a president clinton donald trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment while hillary clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the country
a president clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards india that we saw in the s overseen by her husband after he took office in  the us relationship with india went on a considerable downslide for nearly a year clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to india even as he went about opposing india on multiple fronts leading to anger in the indian establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening india by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions
in  senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super  clause of the american trade law
these economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the s the terms dunkel draft super  wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india
by  india was justified in believing that indous relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudoracist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process
more clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same bloodsoaked albright who advocated bombing yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the clintons she also knows how to abuse her power lest we forget albright also justified the deaths of half a million iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were worth it and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman albright has already threatened women in america and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for hillary clinton
there is already talk of joe biden in the frame as secretary of state under hillary clinton biden would continue his antiindia agenda and try to thwart the development of indias space programme and other technological advancements then of course there is hillarys closest confidante a duplicitous lady called huma abedin who is of pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in pakistan and saudi arabia abedin could end up playing an important role in determining american foreign policy and would be certainly antimodi
another point against hillary clinton is that the hawkish henry kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same kissinger who is so hostile against india many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end
it is in the light of this setting that many indianamericans have opposed the candidacy of hillary clinton and have come out in support of donald trump in contrast to the policies of the clintons trump has promised to make india the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister narendra modi trump has also reached out to hindus in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants to a hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for india
in order for india to build a constructive relationship with us it requires people in both countries to have good intentions it is clear that india cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the us if hillary clinton is running the corridors of power on the other hand donald trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for india",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Turkey_PKK_e0749.JPG,bs,gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters shooting heads,bill clinton cabinet members pursued antiindia activities secretary state hillary president doubt continue bully india shares weeks left find president trump president clinton donald trump perceived candidate corrupt establishment hillary clinton seen part fabric establishment corrupt candidate run president history country president clinton weeks would return us hostile climate towards india saw overseen husband took office us relationship india went considerable downslide nearly year clinton bother appointing ambassador india even went opposing india multiple fronts leading anger indian establishment initially intent disarming weakening india preventing access technology also mounted sustained attack indian economy imposing several economic sanctions senator joe biden vice president barack obama introduced amendment bill granting aid russia making aid conditional fact russia could sell cryogenic engines indias space programme clinton administration hellbent hurting development indias space technology sectors blocked sale cray supercomputers approved ronald reagan administration india also targeted several economic sanctions threatened called super clause american trade law economic sanctions specifically borne way mr clinton attacked indian textile carpet industries throughout terms dunkel draft super wto patent laws became synonyms us attempts retard indian economy led many protests india india justified believing indous relations hit lowest point things took dramatic turn worse bill clintons second term office madeleine albright became new secretary state increasingly hostile india especially pseudoracist television outbursts fact loved attacking india much went leaving office called plebiscite kashmir justifying actions violent groups process clintons policies look like death sentence americans things expect hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must indicted hillary clinton ushered one party dictatorship monopoly capital remember bloodsoaked albright advocated bombing yugoslavia got investment firm attempt takeover mines country like clintons also knows abuse power lest forget albright also justified deaths half million iraqi children claimed deaths worth icing cake particularly nasty woman albright already threatened women america claimed special place hell reserved vote hillary clinton already talk joe biden frame secretary state hillary clinton biden would continue antiindia agenda try thwart development indias space programme technological advancements course hillarys closest confidante duplicitous lady called huma abedin pakistani descent whose family links radical elements pakistan saudi arabia abedin could end playing important role determining american foreign policy would certainly antimodi another point hillary clinton hawkish henry kissinger supports oeuvre secretary state kissinger hostile india many racist statements even tape end light setting many indianamericans opposed candidacy hillary clinton come support donald trump contrast policies clintons trump promised make india best friend us stated looks forward working prime minister narendra modi trump also reached hindus us always risk unknown clear trump make change wants hillary presidency certainly major step back india order india build constructive relationship us requires people countries good intentions clear india cannot strong forward looking relationship us hillary clinton running corridors power hand donald trump articulated right intent stance holds promise india,1,,,,,

obbop,2016-10-31T23:37:00.000+02:00,no title,"the article explains a lot of the background to the white helmets and asks some important questions about the relations between government and ngos or as the author terms them neargovernment organisations the author should also be commended for the extensive bibliography
the author suggests that the truth about the white helmets may lie somewhere in the middle that the white helmets is a dualpurpose organisation with both humanitarian and propaganda functions
the author offers no evaluation of the video evidence provided by the white helmets which to a number of people seems incontrovertably fake and staged if this video evidence is indeed faked then it invites the question why is this necessary where are all the real casualties hasnt the russian bombing killed any civilians at all
the scd or white helmets counts nearly  rescue workers this claim comes only from the white helmets it could well be that the foreign office is paying for  salaries but whether those drawing
them are occupied in fulltime humanitarian work is another matter
after watching carefully the dubious video footage of rescue scenes and the far more convincing footage of white helmets participating in torture and abuse of prisoners it is difficult to see how the white
helmets are anything more than a set of expensive props and uniforms provided to extremist groups in aleppo and idlib and donned for propaganda purposes or when other uniforms are in the wash
furthermore given that the white helmets are funded by the governments and organisations who are totally unmoved by the plight of civilians in the greater part of syria the idea that these bodies would pay for humanitarian duties on the part of the white helmets seems somewhat optimistic
if the white helmets are have a dualpurpose function it is not propagandisthumanitarian but propagandistterrorist
i would also take issue with the statement the sad thing is that avaaz has learned nothing from its own campaign for a nofly zone in libya this view like the idea that the us etc keep making mistakes is following a mistaken policy presupposes that avaaz is wellintentioned that it opposes the destruction of iraq libya syria iran russia",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Turkey_PKK_e0749.JPG,bs,title,article explains lot background white helmets asks important questions relations government ngos author terms neargovernment organisations author also commended extensive bibliography author suggests truth white helmets may lie somewhere middle white helmets dualpurpose organisation humanitarian propaganda functions author offers evaluation video evidence provided white helmets number people seems incontrovertably fake staged video evidence indeed faked invites question necessary real casualties hasnt russian bombing killed civilians scd white helmets counts nearly rescue workers claim comes white helmets could well foreign office paying salaries whether drawing occupied fulltime humanitarian work another matter watching carefully dubious video footage rescue scenes far convincing footage white helmets participating torture abuse prisoners difficult see white helmets anything set expensive props uniforms provided extremist groups aleppo idlib donned propaganda purposes uniforms wash furthermore given white helmets funded governments organisations totally unmoved plight civilians greater part syria idea bodies would pay humanitarian duties part white helmets seems somewhat optimistic white helmets dualpurpose function propagandisthumanitarian propagandistterrorist would also take issue statement sad thing avaaz learned nothing campaign nofly zone libya view like idea us etc keep making mistakes following mistaken policy presupposes avaaz wellintentioned opposes destruction iraq libya syria iran russia,1,,,,,
ahtribune.com,2016-11-03T02:00:00.000+02:00,iraqi soldier battling in mosul reunited with his family after two years of estrangement,"it doesnt matter what the friggin legal and ethics people say we need to win this motherfucker  mr scott foval field director americans united for change retained by the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee  shares
   
an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make hillary clinton our next president these are the oligarchs the  whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life hillary clinton is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will
to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general
who are these people the top  of wealthholders numbers about  million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are hillary and bill clinton whose net worth about  million qualifies the couple for the  stratum by a factor of  others are wall street bankersthe clintons primal financial benefactors and firstname friends lloyd blankfein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the  would be the corporate elite 
candidate clintons relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status
this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting  of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research 
more a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin
instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption  the story of moribund democracy is detailed here  the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy
yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery
the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms
perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch
a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks  they looked into the grand strategy makers the  most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill clintons bushs and obamas in the clinton administration  of the  grand strategy makers  were linked to  different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration  of the   had connections to  corporations in the obama administration  of the  over  had such toplevel corporate affiliations with  companies
smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly  the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill clinton administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying  trillion in americans household wealth  halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired  in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money
for the last  years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite
two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying
the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes
your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average  million in campaign funding a senator  million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions hillary clinton has taken in  million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising
undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were  for a senate race  for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic
the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of  the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up  superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited  print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race  among them were george stephanoplous and  others from abc rachel maddow and  more from msnbc gloria borger and  of her colleagues from cnn and  from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two
the firstandmost strategy worked secretary clinton preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo  sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the clinton campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum
to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games
this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed
not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated clintons superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced clintons presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine   frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval 
no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the  reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence
enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and hillarys paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the clinton campaign prior to the debate from time to time i get the questions in advance the attempt to reschedule the illinois primary another tranche of emails arrives braziles complicity with the clinton campaign is broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the clinton foundation hosts pay to play the clintons personal enrichment the  million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco
finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude
once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june   by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here 
then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly
that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then hillary clintons nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy
but the corporate elite will not be denied given the clintondnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed
the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the clintondnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception hillary clinton promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it
but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting hillary clinton is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust
here now we need to be vigilant

mohsen abdelmoumen  do you think the united states can claim to be democratic simply by electing a woman president can we talk about democracy in the usa with a candidate of the financial lobbies and aipac
ann garrison no of course not no more than we could claim to be a democracy because we elected a black president these two elections signify nothing more than the inclusion of previously excluded classes of people in the super elite the united states is an oligarchy of the   of the  any president who is not already among the  like bill clinton becomes part of the  by serving its interests and then peddling influence after leaving office no one has developed an influence peddling machine as welloiled as the clintons with bill working the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative while hillary was secretary of state just imagine the new depths of corruption that the next eight years and beyond could bring obama has said hes now considering a move from the white house to venture capitalism that has silicon valley slathering at the opportunity
every four years americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs andor aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the paytoplay campaign contributions of the oligarchs
in municipal and county elections and ballot measures americans often do have real choices but the higher and more powerful the office the greater the corruption and oligarchic control nevertheless only a small minority of americans actually vote n local elections the atlantics citylab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than  vote in mayoral elections in  of the  most populous cites disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of american political life
regarding federal elections this concept of democracy within the largest most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with when us citizens cast ballots to elect a new commanderinchief who will continue the project of perpetual war military industrial profits and global hegemony how democratic is that the vast majority of those who will suffer and die dont get to vote the only exceptions are members of the us armed services who die in us wars if those on the other side of the pentagons crosshairs were able to vote im sure they would elect our green party presidential candidate jill stein who said we say to trump we dont need no friggin wall we just need to stop invading other countries her running mate vice presidential candidate ajamu baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white mans burden and said you have to ask yourself when was the last time the us has been on the side of the people and the answer is never
more top aide to hillary clinton urges the fbi to disclose what it knows about trumps russia ties what will hillary clinton do for india not much and heres why clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency how do you explain the dynastic governance clinton is the american dream in all its glory
im not sure i can explain the clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one chelsea has been very involved in the clinton foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day we have had other political dynasties most notably the roosevelts the kennedys and the bushes and there are many lower level dynasties like the browns in california jerry brown the current governor of california is the son of former california governor pat brown new york state has the cuomos governor andrew cuomo is the son of former governor mario cuomo and his brother chris cuomo is a prominent corporate television host
regarding the american dream i assume youre referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules you can achieve some proportionate degree of status security and prosperity if so the clintons certainly arent living the american dream because although they did well in school theyve hardly played by the rules theyve enriched themselves with that welloiled influence peddling operation i mentioned earlier the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative were all wondering whether hillary clinton and maybe even bill clinton might finally be indicted now that the fbi has reopened its investigation of clinton email because more of it was discovered on the laptop that anthony weiner  a former congressman under fbi investigation for sex offense  shared with his wife clinton aide huma abedin if hillary clinton is elected shell have to be impeached convicted and removed from office but thats extremely unlikely  no matter whats in the newly discovered email  if her party the democrats win a majority in the house and more than a one third minority in the senate it takes a majority in the house to impeach a president and a twothirds majority in the senate to then convict and remove a president so hillary clinton is at a berlusconi moment in her sordid career her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected getting back to the american dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a yearold white house intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee however his own party held a majority in the senate and they acquitted him this was all legal according to the us constitution but does it really sound like he was playing by the rules during the final days of his presidency clinton acquitted glencore international founder mark rich an international fugitive who had fled to switzerland his exwife had donated to the democratic national committee the clinton presidential library and hillary clintons new york senate campaign
according to the law president clinton had the authority to acquit rich but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption
in  clinton polished the reputation of president nursultan nazarbayev kazakhstans autocratic leader and human rights offender who then gave a uranium mining lease to canadian businessman frank giustras shell company making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight giustra then made a big contribution to the clinton foundation no one has claimed that this was illegal but is it playing by the rules
when guistra sold a majority stake in his company uranium one to rosatom the russian atomic energy agency it was approved by secretary of state hillary clinton giustra then contributed  million to the clinton foundation and bill clinton was offered a  speaking engagement with a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin does that sound like playing by the rules and now hillarys trying to make us believe that russias meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with russia over syria i dont think shes kidding about the confrontation but the clinton foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances
meanwhile most of the rest of us are not living the american dream sixtythree percent of americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe unable to handle a  car repair or a  emergency room bill  the clintons as i said serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join when bill clinton was on his way out in the last months of his presidency he worked with republicans in the lame duck congress to deregulate the banking industry by  its dishonest excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy costing millions of americans their jobs andor homes then as a new york senator hillary clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crashs wake
how do you explain that candidate clinton who failed as secretary of state with the death of the us ambassador in libya her health problems the scandal of emails is the candidate of the democrats
again clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined many people believe that the nomination was stolen from bernie sanders the democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy growing income inequality and even the israeli lobbys dominance in american politics
but theres one other important element to this americans who identify as liberals supporters of womens rights andor antiracists have such a longstanding allegiance to the democratic party that supporting its nominee every four years is their kneejerk reaction ever escalating foreign wars dont seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of us troops and once the republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic donald trump defeating trump became a liberal crusade
there are of course glimmers of rationality and hope yesterday i was out canvassing for an oakland california ballot measure with a young black man a college sophomore despite trumps overt racism he told me that he considers clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with russia over syria he understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war accidental or not and that trump for all his faults says that the cold war is over that nato is largely obsolete and that clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with russia by promising to remove bashar alassad
our green party presidential candidate jill stein is reported to be polling at  among voters under  and much of bernie sanderss support was quite visibly from the same age group local grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control they include community gardens renewable energy buyers cooperatives and gmofree zones if a ballot initiative to make californias sonoma county gmofree passes the whole northwest coast of california will be a gmofree zone from santa cruz to humboldt counties and including one inland county trinity
dont you think that the twoheaded american system with the candidates of two traditional parties democratic and republican is out of breath
i wouldnt say its out of breath because its still very much in control however trump has left the republican party in disarray with many republican luminaries and funders defecting to clinton who is welcoming them with open arms as black agenda report editor glen ford has written  the clintons have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the us ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons the scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the lords of capital so well for so long has come undone thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules the two parties of the ruling class have become one
its hard to say whether or not the republican party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does
one possibility could significantly change this if green party presidential candidate dr jill stein wins  in this election the green party will become an official national party eligible for  of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee this year all federal funds went to the two official national parties republicans and democrats who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money the greens take no corporate money
five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much but it would be a huge watershed for the us greens it would be a big psychological and visibility boost and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that jill steins campaign has been able to raise
winning  would also ensure ballot access for the greens in most states not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races as it is greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the  states
everyone knows that clinton is the future president of the usa in your opinion why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing clinton in the oval office
she is backed by the oligarchy corporate and dynastic particularly the investment bankers the oil industry and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars they are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid clinton operatives in this election and the corporate media like the cops serve as protectors of the oligarchy and again the majority of americans are politically disengaged
you are close to jill stein head of the green party which emerged late in the campaign why was this alternative sabotaged
well i wouldnt say im close to jill personally but she knows who i am and i of course know who she is ive reported on her campaign and on the us greens for the past year on radio and in print and online outlets and im always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages i write for the black agenda report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors who have given their full support to the green party this year even as bernie sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the democratic nomination in these times that are so easy to see as the end times shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have regardless of the geographic distance between us
jills campaign could hardly compete with the republicans and democrats because neither she nor any other greens solicit or accept corporate money we stand behind the slogan people and planet before profits and we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers fossil fuel giants and agrochemical companies who profit from it jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half closing all the us military bases in foreign countries and launching a peace offensive she proposes free public education from kindergarten through college the abolition of student debt national health insurance and a green new deal that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal immoral lethal and environmentally catastrophic us wars the green new deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before its too late to stop the climate meltdown  if it isnt too late already and it would fully employ americans in meaningful dignified and cooperative work for the common good
of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the deathmarch industries i would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent jill stein and ajamu baraka from winning the  that would make us an official national party
i have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop greens at the local level in  matt gonzalez the green partys mayoral candidate in san francisco seemed to have a good chance of winning that so alarmed the democratic party that it sent all its best known most powerful names and faces to san francisco to campaign for the democratic candidate they sent hillary and bill they sent jesse jackson they sent many democratic party superstars more than once they seemed to be more concerned about defeating matt gonzalez and the greens in san francisco than they were about defeating george bush and the republicans in the following years presidential election
one of the founders of the san francisco green party was elected to the city and county board of supervisors twice but when he ran for sheriff an executive office democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the greens and joined the democratic party which he did they still got rid of him after his first term with a really ugly campaign but thats another complicated story in itself the city and county of san francisco once had more elected greens than any city or county in the country but many of those that greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the democratic party for the sake of their political careers
is not hillary clinton a danger for humanity
hell yes i agree with congolese author and political activist patrick mbeko who said shes more dangerous than isis for all the reasons ive already mentioned her dark alliance with the deathmarch industries and her seeming eagerness to confront russia over syria andor on russias borders in the interest of global hegemony russian uranium deal aside i think that diana johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in russia
and i have to mention my friends from the african great lakes region  particularly uganda rwanda burundi and the democratic republic of the congo  which became the killing grounds of the s as the us using african proxies established itself as the dominant power there most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the clintons all but certain return to the white house the clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the first and second congo wars and later the humanitarian interventions in libya syria and iraq if the truth about rwanda and dr congo were known bill clinton would be implicated in mass murder but thats true of every us president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that no ones going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority
you have many worked on africa how do you explain the french leadership in africa
well im no expert in this but i can say a few things
first i wouldnt call it leadership id say that france sustains a neocolonial and military presence in africa france was a partner in the destruction of libya in mali niger the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo france is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates  of its electricity theres no doubt that france was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister president thomas sankara and the installation of president blaise compaoré in burkina faso i dont see any sign that french policy towards burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now despite its resignation to compaorés ouster by a popular movement
france and the us now appear to be military partners in africa more often than not but during the rwandan war and massacres and the congo wars of the s the us displaced france as the dominant power there
however a source of ongoing tension between france and the us has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the rwandan genocide the us defends rwandan president paul kagames account in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage kagame blames france particularly for operation turquoise in which french troops created a humanitarian corridor for rwandan refugees mostly hutus who were fleeing the advance of kagames rwandan patriotic army this conflict has recently been renewed first with france reopening its investigation of allegations that kagame ordered the assassination of rwanda and burundis hutu presidents juvenal habyarimana and cyprien ntaryamira in  rwanda responded by accusing  french officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in rwanda
in  nicholas sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between france and the us and rwanda by accepting the usrwandan account of the massacres he publicly apologized for frances alleged guilt in rwandas tragedy  and shortly thereafter france was rewarded with greater access to dr congos resource riches however alain juppé who was the french prime minister at the time of the rwandan massacres and operation turquoise was having none of that he even left the country during kagames  reconciliaton visit to paris  now juppé seems to be leading sarkozy in the bid for his partys nomination and if he is elected president the history of rwanda and dr congo in the s will be more fiercely contested most of my rwandan friends very much hope that juppé will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened they believe for one that operation turquoise saved many rwandan lives
while africa is a young continent how do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who dont want lose the power
the old presidents cling to power and the western powers with geostrategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people rwandas kagame and ugandas museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the us and other western interests
france the us and all the rest of the nato nations appear to be united in their determination to topple burundis nkurunziza who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the east particularly russia in resource extraction contracts i cant explain mugabes hold on power at age  or omar albashirs at  since neither are us aliies youll have to ask africans in those countries to explain that
in your opinion is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of africa why doesnt africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model
i really hesitate to say anything about that because im not african myself and i think western media often use the word tribe as a racial slur that disguises western resource interests at play in african conflicts i recently wrote a piece about the new film a brilliant genocide  and milton allimadi the ugandanborn editor of the black star news told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which id used the word tribe i told him id been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it im now reading his book  hearts of darkness how white writers created the racist image of africa 
why are congolese being massacred in beni territory north kivu province  the first question ive asked to try to answer that question is what resources are there in beni the answer is oil timber gold diamonds wolfram coltan and cassiterite beni is a vivid example of the saying everybody wants a piece of congo no one could convince me that the industrial nations hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts why are all the deadly ethnic conflicts in dr congos resourcerich eastern provinces
the competition andor animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real as they are in the west but in africa the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests
i sometimes cohost a show called afrobeatradio with my friend wuyi jacobs on wbainew york city and we both hope to someday produce a show about rwanda and burundi in which we wont have to use the words hutu or tutsi dr léopold munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in rwandan history that were exaggerated by europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other
libya lives total chaos how do you analyze the situation in libya
its horrible like so much else it makes me deeply ashamed to be an american if you read hillary clintons email its easy to see that the usnato war on libya was for one another western war against another defiant resource nationalist muammar gaddafi regardless of whatever human rights offenses gaddafi or saddam hussein were guilty of both were resource nationalists as was mohammed mossadegh the secular democratically elected prime minister of iran who nationalized iranian oil before our cia and the uks m ousted him in the  coup i wrote about how this played out in libya in  clinton email we came we saw we got oil 
obama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the libyan war was the greatest mistake of his presidency but id say his greatest mistake was waging the libyan war in the first place like the iraq war it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the middle east and north africa

the signing of the comprehensive economic trade agreement with canada ceta on the th of october marks the beginning of north americas annexation of europe the negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors for over  deputies in the european parliament there are more than  thousands lobbyists the society for european affairs professionals seap  the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations  this is the real power block in europe the european worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions multinational corporations will have unlimited power over european workers who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle
will european workers lie down and accept this imposture what concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over european workers which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold
there are currently no political parties running in the major european elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests but there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite we will mention them below
there are two important geopolitical processes to consider here the first is the eastwest corporate  geopolitical axis america is pulling the european peninsula away from the eurasian continent with the installation of a neonazi regime in kiev washington attempted to recreate an intermarium from the baltic sea to the black sea and down to the eastern mediterranean  driving a permanent wedge between russia and germany
in order to facilitate the social transformation of europe into a america minor millions of pilgrims are necessary hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious european workers with deracine youths  in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the powerelite
in the new trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind in each european country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare these antifa are the modern equivalent to oswald mosleys fascist gangs in the s they represent the same class interests pettybourgeois leftism is the new world orders avantgarde
a favourite passtime of the antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers one can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs so police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the spanish civil war such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations the agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services french police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over french suburbs they complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents they have been demonstrating in paris they have been calling for an end to the control of the french police by free masonry exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target black youths with spotchecksm  very often without reason
the recent demonstrations by french police in france against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the french police could be waking up to the reality that france is government by a criminal gang after the magnanville terrorist attack in june where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of president hollande and prime minister manuel valls it was a highly significant act of insubordination
the police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another  that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses
many of these dissident police officers are linked to le pens national front a reliable source in french intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left they see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology from the arab spring to nuit debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism the potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more study
what should we make of all this in the context of ceta as i have said on numerous occasions the far right in france are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie but the national front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left the prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass families
as i have pointed out before looking at a debate between the trotskyist jeanluc melanchon and marine le pen in  one would have thought that le pen was was the leftist and melanchon the rightwing militarist melanchon shamelessly defended the nato bombing campaign of libya while le pen opposed it
civil war on the horizon
the rightwing presidential candidate philippe de villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the french territory between muslims and nonmuslims he quote s francois hollandes own writings to back up his claims everyone is talking about an imminent civil war in the bars and cafes of paris one can hear more and more disgruntled french citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class
the scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of french politics but one should not have illusions about the national front they are following the menacious zionist narrative on the war on terror muslims are the problem the partys vicepresident forian philippot is close to the ultrazionist lawyer gilleswilliam goldnagel a friend of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate jean frédéric poisson who said hillary clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the zionists poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the representative council of jewish institutions in france crif where he sought forgiveness he was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget in spite of the national fronts antimuslim bias an increasing number of muslims are voting for the party many muslims prefer the national front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left  with their pseudo antiracism and humanitarian wars
there have also been major strikes by police in ireland for similar reasons to france french workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat meanwhile the french government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to britain to stay in france the socialist party is creating a new electorate it is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants the oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through gmos takfiri antiislam and total reification of life ceta is the beginning of the end for social hope it is the prelude to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip  the most evil trade deal in history
french vicepresident of the trilateral commission herve de carmoy wrote a book in  entitled leuramerique  euramerica where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic superstate run

the palestine football association pfa in a first testing of palestines ability to fight its battle with israel in international courts plans to go to the worlds top court for sports in a bid to force its israeli counterpart to view israeli settlements on the west bank as occupied territory rather than an extension of the jewish state
the potential palestinian move follows the palestinian authoritys campaign to isolate israel in international organizations and challenge israels occupation of the west bank in the international criminal court icc
using soccer as a testing ground palestines efforts to confront israel in international organizations has produced mixed results while palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations the pfa last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body fifa to suspend israel the pfa argued that the policies of the israeli government and the israel football association ifa violated fifa rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory
the pfa has since been unable to push fifa towards any punitive steps against israel instead fifa opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse palestine is expected to take legal recourse if fifa fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in january
the pfas focus since failing to get israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in israeli settlements on the west bank from playing in israeli lower divisions fifa rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federations territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation the pfa rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize israeli settlements and the occupation
more swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match pfa president jibril rajoub suggested that the pfa would take its case to the court of arbitration for sport cas after a sevenhour meeting earlier this month of a fifa committee headed by tokyo sexwale failed to resolve the issue
mr sexwale is scheduled to visit israel later this month for a meeting with israeli sports minister miri regev the fifa council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in january the pfa is likely to prepare its case for cas but wait with filing it until after the january meeting
israel sees the palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds that sees penalization as a means of forcing the jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the  middle east war
condemnation of the israeli occupation and settlements by the united nations security council constitutes the legal basis for the pfas approach as well as potential challenges in international courts
the strength of the palestinian position has been weakened changing persian gulf attitudes towards israel and saudi and united arab emirates pressure on palestine authority president mahmoud abbas persian gulf states despite paying lip service to the palestinian cause have become more public about their informal relations with israel based on common opposition to expanding iranian influence in the region
writing in the kingdoms controlled press a prominent saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel the uae last year agreed to the opening of an israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the abu dhabibased international renewable energy agency rather than the uae government bahrain as part of an agreement to host next years fifa congress has consented to issue visas to representatives of the ifa israeli nationals are barred from travelling to persian gulf countries
at the same time saudi arabia and the uae have been pressuring mr abbas to resolve his differences with mohammed dahlan the controversial former abu dhabibased gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the palestinian president mr dahlan is widely seen as a successor to year old mr abbas who would be acceptable to israel
israel may be able to count on some degree of tacit persian gulf support within fifa but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the palestinians
the palestinians focus on the israeli west bank teams has however raised the bar for israel an agreement between prime minister benyamin netanyahu and former fifa president sepp blatter struck last year addresses many of the pfas grievances but not the issue of six the west bank teams their status goes to the heart of the palestinianisraeli conflict the legal status of territory occupied by israel since 
under the agreement mr netanyahu proposed to give palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between palestinian areas and those under israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of palestinian soccer mr netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players travel between the west bank and gaza that are separated by israeli territory
israel initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in  years a west bank team hebrons al ahli passage to gaza to play a palestine cup final against the strips al shejaia hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the pfa cancelled the return match in hebron after israel agreed to grant passage to only  of the  players who were scheduled to travel implementation of the agreement has since evaporated
the pfa by putting the west bank teams at the top of their agenda has made it tougher for fifa and israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of israelipalestinian peace making israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court yet that may be exactly what would best serve the palestine authoritys overall

ever since the telling of biblical fairy tales few stories have lived up to the hype around the mismatch between the shepherd boy david and the giant goliath in the biblical encounter david prevailed by keeping his foe goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon his sling
today a modernday version of david and goliath is playing out
although granted political asylum by ecuador a target of us empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in ecuadors london embassy under constant surveillance by british police the fully weaponized us empire which boasts of its fullspectrum dominance has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed as in having no conventional weaponry man who heads a publishing organization
this uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the militaryeconomic albeit faltering on both fronts behemoth to the worlds public the protransparency publisher wikileaks its founder and de facto political prisoner julian assange and antisecrecy collaborators infuriated the united states establishment with a slew of documents emails and graphic exposes like the  collateral murder  video that demonstrated a us military engaged in war crimes
nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps but it is a oneway street as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question
more swedish government implicated in charges against assange un body to rule on arbitrary detention of wikileaks founder websavvy wikileaks objects to this double standard and it welcomes vets and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the publics right to be informed about what their government is up to
evidence makes it clear that the violent american establishment engages in browbeating inciting socalled color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments military encirclement and saber rattling this selfdescribed indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as china and russia was not about to have its fullspectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers
leaning on its allies the us enacted a financing squeeze on wikileaks many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by us sanctions but tiny wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the washington schemers
in an attempt to topple wikileaks the us establishment has sought to lop off the head of wikileaks it has kept close tabs on julian assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring assange down in sweden we have been warned that the pentagon for example is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us
in sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape in selfdefense assange spoke to the facts of the situation 
here we have a case the swedish case where i have never been charged with a crime where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum those are the facts but what is the rhetoric
 the un formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes i am subject to persecution by the united states
disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire
while in britain assange was eventually placed under house arrest sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview assange in britain on the allegations it insisted he come to sweden which assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere knowing full well that the us department of justice was preparing a case against him sweden refused to give such an assurance which speaks strongly about swedens intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens
despite all this intrigue wikileaks has continued to publish and assange has continued to give interviews assange did not cower instead he chose to fight back against hillary clinton and the democrats this is because hillary clinton and the democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government
clinton and the democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris along the way many outs presented themselves to the democrats they could have dropped the grand jury investigation they could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for assanges deportation from sweden the us could even have given a presidential pardon to assange extremely telling about the caliber of man that assange is is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner chelsea manning
but empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire empire does not negotiate deals it takes what it wants because it believes it can
the result
the corruption in the democratic party has come to light wikileaks revealed that the democratic national committee conspired against party aspirant bernie sanders and heads fell clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz
clintons emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair john podesta revelations include payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations a  direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism of isil in the middle east libya more than anyone elses war was hillary clintons war and banks buying cabinet positions
the clinton campaign has predictably been thrown into disarray
the clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere the clintonites blamed russian hacking for interfering in the us presidential race finally julian assange felt compelled to state 
the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything hilary clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source
neither is wikileaks complicit with russia
we have published about  documents of various kinds that relate to russia most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia most of which are critical our russiadocuments have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia which they use our documents to back up
graciously toward clinton assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to  drone  him imagine what the response would have been if assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against clinton
presently assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the clinton campaign for the presidency
trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money  are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves
however a counter coup was announced against the coup by clinton cronyism it is said to include fbi cia military intelligence other security organizations through julian assange that have promised to stop clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies
a revolution
no matter what transpires on november  the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental us democracy has  again  been revealed to be glaringly corrupt most importantly the worlds preeminent militaryindustrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person properly framed it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater

an important question is on the  election statewide ballot in massachusetts question  deals with the states charter school cap without the cap upwards of  charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year the charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofmassachusetts in large part due to the obama administration a vote no is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nationwide as massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next president of the united states it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in washington
the obama administration immediately created the race to the top program after the  election this program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it the department of education funneled billions of us dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor mostly black cities as long as these districts met the mandates of the program these mandates included the closure of failing schools mergers with forprofit charter schools and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories race to the top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire us public education system
the results have been disastrous hundreds of public schools have closed around the country tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired in new orleans nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by  publicly funded charter schools the chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in  
the impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class the civil rights project of ucla has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools  furthermore charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves all the while these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against els and disabled students
in addition charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates corporate charter operators also cream students from the top and toss the rest even so charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores  what the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite which has masterfully used media and nonprofit manipulation to demonize public education
the usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in massachusetts the new york lobbying group families for excellent schools is controlled by hedge fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the walton family ie walmart another organization education reform now advocacy has received upwards of  million dollars from the same source  charter schools are often labeled public because they receive tax payer dollars however the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them
a yes vote on question two would place the education of students in massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval but fortyfive public schools would be in danger of closure over  million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state at the moment the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than  charter schools if the cap islifted however this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students families and educatorsvictimto the shock and awe privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades
opposition to privatization is being led by the organization save our schools save our schools consists of families teachers students and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the massachusetts public education system charter schools already drain  million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands a vote no would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators
a no vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the massachusetts area over the last few years the boston school bus drivers union local  won a historic victory against the veolia corporation in  the harvard dining workers of local  unite here followed by defeating harvards bid to raise healthcare costs in october of  now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent fullscale privatization
doing so will not be easy the model of unionmanagement cooperationwith thedemocratic party continues to prevent workers in massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault a vote no on question  in massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful pushback against the forces behind privatization however a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a peoples movement the fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the

Daniel Haiphong,2016-11-07T02:00:00.000+02:00,massachusetts is the next laboratory for school privatization and why it must be stopped,"professor dr mujahid kamran vicechancellor of the university of punjab on the suspension without pay of prof tony hall  shares
   
professor mike mahon president and vice chancellor lethbridge canada
dear professor mike mahon
it is with a sense of great sadness that i have learnt of the suspension without pay of professor anthony hall one of the most distinguished scholars not only of the  but a researcher and writer who is recognised and respected globally in a country like pakistan which is far behind canada in term of education research and scholarship no teacher or nonteacher of any university can be suspended without pay when someone is suspended he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension if canada is doing better than us on various scales then one would expect that suspension without pay puts canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play i may add respectfully that in pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing the decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment
 from his writings that i have read over a period of time it is evident that professor anthony hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state his analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly and his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation  or any university for that matter should have been proud to have professor hall on its faculty his suspension creates an impression even from this distance from where i write that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech have targeted people like professor anthony hall who speak out for democracy decency peace and justice
i have found out from the internet that bnai brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech it is quite evident that the charge that professor anthony hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious to the contrary it appears that an antimuslim bias has been created in your institution by professor halls unfortunate suspensionthere is also a strong impression that bnai brith has taken over the administrative decision making at lethbridge
more suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech bnai brith attack on canadian professor has roots in zionist false flag tactics it is also worrying that bnai brith have now targeted canadian universities and canadian society if this is the case then the situation is disturbing not just for lethbridge and canada but for all freedom loving people worldwide when i was a young student at university of edinburgh scotland in the s i used to meet many canadian students and i found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice the suspension of professor hall is inconsistent with my image of the canadian people that i had then formed
on behalf of the academic community of the university of the punjab established  i urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend professor hall it will go a long way in rehabilitating the impression of people worldwide about the upholding of free speech academic freedom and genuine scholarly discourse at lethbridge
with my humble regards and very best wishes

usa usa usa they chanted together in the hilton ballroom as the results came in who needs polls they never gave him a chance but now we have it president donald trump not only were the polls spectacularly wrong who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what america was thinking across its societal spectrum what it wanted what was felt deep in its blood
it is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire west has wallowed in since the s and a rejection of obama and the false hope he decried the impotent nature of us political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by crooked hillary
the world must live with it democracy has spoken and theyre going to have to get over the words president trump some will head for the hills some will run to canada others will continue to cry but as obama said yesterday regardless of the result tomorrow the sun will still shine
this is a cry for american exceptionalism and like him or not trump typifies that he is committed to education and demands high performance selling well is an admirable skill for a president to have negotiating with congress internationally etc is exceptionally useful trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose
trumps business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates  this gives him keen realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships andor antagonism between different industries and particular governments
more trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trump turkey and police tyranny the crisis of imperialism finds political expression an america in denial this vote comes down to the reckoning that for too long politicians have sold the american people out to foreign nations and global industry what donald trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying nevertrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate
although it is entirely true that trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes he brings something to the presidential table no other candidate had before he speaks his mind
america clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear they want the facts straight
president trump isnt cut from the political class that class which is entrenched in its selfinterest and has let the country down time and time again ross perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables a corrupted ethically questionable president is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and im not talking about donald trump
trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos he is not a social engineer a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts the liberal democratic policies of obama us rep nancy pelosi us sen harry reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today
so what if his language is intemperate and insulting even lacking in nobility from time to time how can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long
obama won because conservative voters stayed home he had promise and he let so many down what did clinton have and that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote

presenting and attendance million of shias at arbaeen create a massive and international unity among shias this capacity can be useful for huge cultural action
mashrigh and tasnim report that different religions ever require their followers to attend in specific days in the year for solidarity and correlation between followers to identify the social stream this kind of attendance is a good publicity of that social stream and influences the international community
easter the christians religious day
for example christians celebrate easter as the most important religious day with a long history every year
 this day is a holiday in christians calendar and followers of jesus christ hold various ceremonies and celebration in the church
more the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally letting freedom ring how islams universal message continues to speak through imam husayn ibn ali the jews carnival purim
purim is a great religious festival in jewish religion jews have named the fourteenth and fifteenth day of adar in hebrew calendar purim and celebrate it
jews hold celebration in synagogue with reading the book esther after ceremonies children and youth wear the colorful clothes and masks and launch the carnival of joy in occupied palestine territories and jewish cities this ceremony is advertised extensively by the jewish dictatorial media
but muslims
about  million muslims from all over the world travel to mecca saudi arabia in hajj days and perform hajj but  pure mohammadi islam and alavi education is not advertised and explained properly in hajj because of the restrictive policy of saudi regime
imam reza peace be upon him stated if the beauty of islam is heard by others they all will follow wholeheartedly the prophets household inevitably
arbaeen golden opportunity
attending million of shias in arbaeen create a massive and international unity among shias 
karbala can be a symbol of unity and allegiance to imam that has the worlds effects the start of husseini magnetic attraction is in arbaeen this is the magnetic that exists in my and your heart over the centuries
so if we cant publish the shia massage efficiently in hajj we can universalize it in shia glorious presence in the husseini massive rally
in fact the hajj pilgrimage for imam hussein followers is in karbala their try between safa and marvah in the  beyn alharamain and their ihram clothes is the mourning clothes for aba abdallah
walking to shrines is topical
imam hassan askari peace be upon him mentioned that one of the real believers sign is walking to visit imam hussein in arbaeen
imam sadigh peace be upon him told to one of his followers visit imam husseins shrine and dont give it up i asked what is the reward for visiting him imam pbuh stated when you walk to visit imam hussein allah gives you a reward and removes your guilt and raises your grade
at the other time imam sadigh said if someone goes out of his home and walks to visit imam husseins shrine allah gives him a reward and removes him guilt for each step to visit aba abdallah when he reaches to shrine allah considers him among righteous favorites when his rites finish allah registers him among success when he is coming back an angel of god stays on him and tells the messenger of allah says hello and gives tidings to you that all your faults are forgiven start again your actions
walking tradition has an old history
in a way walking tradition for imam hussein in arbaien has an old history walking to visit karbala was customary at sheikh
ansarys time but it was forgotten for a long time it revives again by sheikh mirza hussein noori he walked to visit aba abdallah in  hegira for the last time
although visiting imam hussein s shrine was often difficult and pilgrims were not safe and secure but they were willing to take risks and had an audience to imam hussein in arbaeen
islamic life style
at that time with full of great interest and knowledge in the way hussein path that leads to karbala shias called each other just with hussein visitors zayer alhussein or hussein server khadem olhussein that is a symbol of islamic life style
pilgrims of this holy and spiritual journey have a lot of blessing and gifts from god such as the nice spiritual state with holy sayyed alshohada  generous dealing with pilgrims entertaining and receiving by hussein servers sacrificing and respecting for each other treating elders and sayyeds kindly and considerately visiting the imam husseins holy shrine in arbaeen
role and place of imam husseins visitors
visiting aba abdallah is a good evidence of esteeming and honoring the divine rituals and display love and friendship with prophets household according to the quranic verse of mavaddat
imam husseins holy shrine visitors enter into heaven before all their guilt is disappeared their life will be long and god provides for them and removes their sadness and sorrow
of course if this old tradition that is established again after destruction of iraqi dictator not to be cultural pathology it will certainly have the negative effects
because every phenomenon is threatened it seems if this pilgrimage tradition becomes a primer to the cultural work it will be more effective and blessings than today",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/Mujahid_Kamran_53382.jpg,bs,creating antimuslim bias canadian university,visiting aba abdallah good evidence esteeming honoring divine rituals display love friendship prophets household according quranic verse mavaddat shares presenting attendance million shias arbaeen create massive international unity among shias capacity useful huge cultural action mashrigh tasnim report different religions ever require followers attend specific days year solidarity correlation followers identify social stream kind attendance good publicity social stream influences international community easter christians religious day example christians celebrate easter important religious day long history every year day holiday christians calendar followers jesus christ hold various ceremonies celebration church th days new campaign communitybuilding social solidarity shia muslims gather dc antiterror rally letting freedom ring islams universal message continues speak imam husayn ibn ali jews carnival purim purim great religious festival jewish religion jews named fourteenth fifteenth day adar hebrew calendar purim celebrate jews hold celebration synagogue reading book esther ceremonies children youth wear colorful clothes masks launch carnival joy occupied palestine territories jewish cities ceremony advertised extensively jewish dictatorial media muslims million muslims world travel mecca saudi arabia hajj days perform hajj pure mohammadi islam alavi education advertised explained properly hajj restrictive policy saudi regime imam reza peace upon stated beauty islam heard others follow wholeheartedly prophets household inevitably arbaeen golden opportunity attending million shias arbaeen create massive international unity among shias karbala symbol unity allegiance imam worlds effects start husseini magnetic attraction arbaeen magnetic exists heart centuries cant publish shia massage efficiently hajj universalize shia glorious presence husseini massive rally fact hajj pilgrimage imam hussein followers karbala try safa marvah beyn alharamain ihram clothes mourning clothes aba abdallah walking shrines topical imam hassan askari peace upon mentioned one real believers sign walking visit imam hussein arbaeen imam sadigh peace upon told one followers visit imam husseins shrine dont give asked reward visiting imam pbuh stated walk visit imam hussein allah gives reward removes guilt raises grade time imam sadigh said someone goes home walks visit imam husseins shrine allah gives reward removes guilt step visit aba abdallah reaches shrine allah considers among righteous favorites rites finish allah registers among success coming back angel god stays tells messenger allah says hello gives tidings faults forgiven start actions walking tradition old history way walking tradition imam hussein arbaien old history walking visit karbala customary sheikh ansarys time forgotten long time revives sheikh mirza hussein noori walked visit aba abdallah hegira last time although visiting imam hussein shrine often difficult pilgrims safe secure willing take risks audience imam hussein arbaeen islamic life style time full great interest knowledge way hussein path leads karbala shias called hussein visitors zayer alhussein hussein server khadem olhussein symbol islamic life style pilgrims holy spiritual journey lot blessing gifts god nice spiritual state holy sayyed alshohada generous dealing pilgrims entertaining receiving hussein servers sacrificing respecting treating elders sayyeds kindly considerately visiting imam husseins holy shrine arbaeen role place imam husseins visitors visiting aba abdallah good evidence esteeming honoring divine rituals display love friendship prophets household according quranic verse mavaddat imam husseins holy shrine visitors enter heaven guilt disappeared life long god provides removes sadness sorrow course old tradition established destruction iraqi dictator cultural pathology certainly negative effects every phenomenon threatened seems pilgrimage tradition becomes primer cultural work effective blessings today,1,,,,,
Saurav Dutt,2016-11-09T02:00:00.000+02:00,arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it,"prof rafiq islam responds to the vicechancellor of the university of punjab outlining the background of the hall case at the  shares
   
dear vice chancellor kamran
salam from the east coast of canada
thank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding professor hall like yourself we all have been stunned by the voracity of dr mahons action we used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the establishment we all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group however bnai brith is not just a special interest group it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west allow me to elaborate
you have correctly identified bnai brith to be behind this movement against shutting down free speech while this statement is accurate this phenomenon of targeting canadian universities and canadian society is not something that started now not too long ago it used to be branded as the hidden hand behind the hidden hand during the harper era this operation became a fullblown politically driven policy directive the legislation that dr mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the harper era harper had an extremist rightwing background and organizations like bnai brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda as early as the s i personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of muslim student association at the university of alberta although harper didnt attend that university we were not too far from the epicentre of the neoconservatism movement that was brewing in canada we fastforward  years and come upon the type of events such as professor hall travesty that are products of that time in fact a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of canadian lives only recently we had this court ruling against canadian security intelligence service that was illegally spying on the public this gangsterlike involvement started in  shortly after harper and the neocon came to power
this is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government in fact the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime take for instance the case of omar khadr travesty 
more creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech this case is something we had known albeit too late to intervene at the time and has been subsequently discredited publicly even during the harper regime  the overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely  year old omar khadr who said  you dont care about me  this is what defines the mindset of these people bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience
the attack on professor hall was particularly toxic but equally sinister attacks have taken place before some decade ago now defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring it was the largest muslim organization at a time canadian muslims became the largest religious minority one particular episode involved bnai briths planted story involving a university professor who became the target of hate crime while at the same time investigated for hate crime if it wasnt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then university president current governor general david johnston it would have become career threatening if not life threatening event of the professor top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from donors that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena the vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today what we dont know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing
clearly some of the faithful memberssympathizers apply it publicly such was the case of former professor turned politician irwin cotler who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia then there are others such as alan rock of university of ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia a third group would be lorna marsden of york university that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda yet others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence it doesnt matter which category they belong to they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and for some cases join in to the atrocity this obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late professor david noble who ended up suing york university and canadian jewish congress jointly for conspiring against him professor noble a jew himself faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of jews that wasnt enough dr noble had to take on human rights commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the university authority professor noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon university of ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of alan rock a man without a phd that was at the helm of the university mr rock recently left the universitybut not before leaving the universitys good name in the sewerage of politicking what dr mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim
had i not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last  years i would almost not understand what is at works here in old days such tactic would be unheardof in a university certainly such things couldnt happen in a civilized country i would exclaim
so what happened to professor hall is not new what is new is the waking up of the general public your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about professor hall people are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice for instance in the context of csis an activist jim comeau wrote i would say its time to jail the highest ranking csis to send a clear message to the rest of them do something illegal straight to prison they damn well knew what they were doing was illegal
the peoples revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of julian assange who wrote on us general election day november  
yet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clintons main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsbecause none exists
in the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate
of course recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the united states
to anyone with an iota of conscience there is no mystery here people are making their voice clearly known in the words of claire lanyado i prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil the problem is when a president of university for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately there is no recourse for a professor to fight himher in other cases if such atrocity were launched against a student eg the case of freemanmaloy vs lorna marsden of york university  the student an antizionist jew could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another jewish lawyer peter rosenthal who himself is a university professor of mathematics it was struck down by the court and then it was overruled by the court of appeals at the end the university settled and dr marsden the embattled president was gone the morale of this story is the path to justice is steep but for a professor the path to justice is becoming impossible
the irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes just because they dare speak out against an atrocity of course they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice
thats how extremism works

Rafiq,2016-11-10T02:00:00.000+02:00,the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities,"part  introduction  shares
   
for the last  years i have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts this reluctance to criticize any policies of the israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the americanisrael political action committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices
 former us president jimmy carter 
how the interviews came about
the marxian thesis that the dominant culture and ideology of a society here referred to as social base or just base are those of the dominant class here referred to as system is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power does this tool work in the us model certainly  the relation between the system and its social base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies because of that sustained regularity system and base acted in convergent patterns of dependency in historical perspective it was not possible for the system to transform those colonies into states and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion from that time onward an ideological symbiosis ran between the system and the base not only that but each time the system modifies direction philosophy or ideology the base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception
the patterns of ideological association between the us system and its social base extended into modern times and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections if you look at voters turnout since   you will notice that a relativetolarge majority of americans had voted in those elections my interpretation of the vote in relation to marxs thesis is the following voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies crimes around the world overthrowing foreign governments not in line with washington and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing voting for that system while knowing its attributes policies and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology culture and violence
more zionism is racism zionism goes from bad to worse taking judaism with it how modern is israel green party of canada calls to revoke jewish national fund charitable status caveat that does not necessarily mean that all voters share the systems imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples the pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the systems foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the base resides in two concepts discarding immediately the notion that the base has been cohabitated by the system the first concept has it that the base has given a mandate to the system to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars a dichotomy sets in here the system has its way of life and the base has its own the second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism meaning if the system could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations
 a question would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of active sharing in the policies of the system this subject is open for debate   
the relation between the american system and its base was uniform up to a certain point in history late s until that point the american state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status that uniformity however managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged to be exact despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the base and government as well as the composition of the latter the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was  not open for challenge and  shaped by an exclusive american anglosaxon experience
but when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system that was the first time in us history where the powerful american imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project with that a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the us power the rest is history as a result the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the united states coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the us power the dominant american system itself fell under the domination of one of its social factionsamerican jewish zionists
when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system
as a group american jewish zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment they possess efficient organizational structures have a monolithic political presence across the american system and they know how to finance their activities with us tax money i must note that their alignment with the global agenda of us imperialism is a twopoint expedient the first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of americas interests the second is tactical to reap on behalf of israel the benefits of alignment with slogans such as israel is our only trusted ally in the middle east
the american jewish zionist experience is agenda driven as such their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other jewishrelated consideration
on the domestic front the focus could not be more evident to consolidate zionism and turn it into a means to  perpetuate israel as an american national issue and  make of them the principal factor in defining american politics you can notice the endeavor clearly during us elections when the zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the jews and for israel today voicing dissent against the policies of american jewish zionism or criticizing israel amounts to crime jimmy carter experienced this firsthand when he published his book palestine peace not apartheid  american jewish zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him
as for the jewish zionist foreign agenda this is clearcut and leaves no space for misunderstanding it aims to induce control or lead the united states to  adopt hostile policies toward the arab nations because due to their rejection of the zionist state and  undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to israel equally important it demands that the united states keep denying the palestinians rights for nationhood through american diplomacy what is the rationale recognition of the palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the zionist state and its claim on palestine
because the jewish zionist control of the us system is real and dominant how does the american society figure visàvis this dominance based on observations of the american society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns there can be but one answer zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the american people it is however the dominant culture and ideology of the us political system
observations
first despite gargantuan zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the american people jewish zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for zionist issues and for israel
second due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues a majority of americans have only vague ideas on what zionism is
third to establish roots for their political dominance jewish zionist activists invariably focus not on the american people but on ways to control the american system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter white house and congress
fourth this control did not happen because of elections it is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing jewish zionists to important positions inside the administrations
fifth among the stratagems employed by zionists when they run for elective offices one was particularly effective take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election to do that jewish zionist candidates rarely if ever talk about israel or zionism instead they only debate matters of interest to the voters once elected though promoting israel via american legislations becomes the top hidden agenda
sixth and to conclude this particular argument the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of jewish zionists thus indirectly to israel in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and culturezionism
another point to discuss is the expansion of the jewish zionist power by all accounts such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process in his book the arabists the romance of an american elite  robert d kaplan defined the issue that i framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy kaplan was unambiguous he called these new elites by their names irishamericans and jewishamericans
kaplans viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion he argued that the old elites approached the usarab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog all while keeping an eye on the us imperialist interests his argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion the two groups of postwwii american society that kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of us foreign policy it is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward arabs and muslimseach for his own set of religious political and ideological rationales as for the successive shares of africanamericans and hispanics in the making of the national policy of the united states this is another argument
as a witness to history in early  i began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of american jewish zionists in the making of us policies and wars in the arab world in may of that year as my work became broad in scope i decided to seek more views on the subject i came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where i pose the same questions while some of the prospective interviewees declined and others accepted but then withdrew three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge scholarship and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views
they are francis boyle a professor of international law university of illinois college of law james petras a professor emeritus university of binghamton new york canadian writer and former coeditor of the online publication of dissident voice kim petersen professors boyle and petras answered my questions via phone conversations and petersen via email correspondence
however in the weeks following the interviews my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing in short i was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned today as i thank prof francis boyle prof james petras and kim petersen for sharing their invaluable insight i apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read
introduction
the turning point in the emergence of jewish zionism as a dominant american political force came about when iraq invaded kuwait discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction the jewish zionist establishment seized the occasion mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against iraq to bring their war mania to fruition they unleashed their experts in all directions they talked about iraqs formidable military capabilities and about saddams onemillionman standing army ready to invade saudi arabia and seize its oil they told stories about saddam husseins personal life his bunkers and his mortal nuclear threats to israel and they talked about iraqs threats to us interests and allies in the middle east    here is a brief account of those events
on july   iraqi president saddam hussein met with us ambassador to iraq april glaspie it is on record that glaspie gave hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve iraqs problems with kuwait militarily on august  iraq invaded kuwait on august  george h w bush ordered the freezing of iraqi and kuwaiti assets and immediately placed iraq under hermetic embargo considering the prompt extraordinary antiiraq measures that the united states took in the first  hours of that invasion one wonders what was pushing the us to move so quickly on iraq knowing that only two days earlier this was conducting a us proxy against iran the observation that the us did not take similar actions when iraq invaded iran in  or when israel invaded lebanon in  raises many questions what were the us rationales in taking such measures who conceived them did the us entrap iraq why   
the atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic like a lightning bolt us imperialist and zionist forces instantly mobilized their media talking heads retired generals and bogus experts on the middle east the deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by iraq in kuwait hid a definite scheme incite for war  in the period august    january   israelis and jewish zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war on january   a member coalition in which the us had the lion shareninetyseven percent of the total forceattacked iraq by every standard and minutia of details the war on iraq in  was an american war 
at the end of a war that destroyed one of israels arab adversaries george h w bush might have thought of himself as americas laureate hero he did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the us loan guaranties to israel would have unleashed the jewish zionist establishment against him the fact that he lost to bill clinton who opposed bushs freeze and who stated that israel was the only country that paid back its debts indicated that american jewish zionists had finally reached their objective to perfect ways to control the us politics from the inside  in retrospect it can be said that george h w bush was the last nonzionist american president from bill clinton forward us presidents and their vice president became pawns in the jewish zionist play of power
now as the united states was preparing for war with iraq to liberate kuwait thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it but no one could have ever beaten patrick j buchanans memorable words about how american jewish zionists and israel were pushing for that war he said there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the middle east  the israeli defense ministry and its amen corner   with that buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head am rosenthal a ringleader of us zionist journalism could not bear what he heard in a rebuttal he unleashed an acerbic attack against buchanan his weapon of argument so to speak was the stale and trite accusation of antisemitism
whining rosenthal twisted buchanans clear words and went on to imply that buchanan was in effect engaging in an antijewish tirade he reinterpreted buchanans words and cast them in a standard zionistic fashion he wrote that buchanans intention was the jews are trying to drag us into war only jews want war israeli jews want war to save israels hide american jews who talk of military action against iraq want war because it would suit israeli interests they are willing to spill american blood for israeli interests 
by inserting the word jew in his reply rosenthal and the new york times behind him spat on the face of us political reality under the tight grip of zionism we need not waste our breath on rosenthals petty tactic his clear objective was to distract from the central issue which is buchanans opposition to the planned war against iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity
still buchanan was honest he pointed the finger to israel and its amen corner because that was the truth the fact that most israelis and amen corners happened to be of jewish faith was nonissue to conclude it is evident that buchanan a dreamer of an american republic not empire could not stand by idle while seeing the united states sheepishly fastened to the yoke of zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state israel
buchanan did not stop there truthful and resolute he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the us congress visàvis israel and american jewish zionists he dubbed it as an israelioccupied territory  buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly american politicians would dare not think let alone say notice that buchanan had placed israel before its us amen corner i view this as a statement he clearly implied that israel is the primary decision maker did that also imply that us zionist groups amen corner are puppets moved by israel most likely if so which has more power in setting the us world agenda and policies israel or american jewish zionists dialectically the answer should be israel by means of its amen corner
now in december  jim lehrer a former coanchor of the macneillehrer newshour and later sole anchor of the newshour with jim lehrer  interviewed pat buchanan it is important to mention that jim lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over  years starting in  is that an issue yes and to debate it the following applies whenever a specific group of people be they christian muslim jewish atheist duopoly party apparatchiks etc keeps an important public post for such a long duration the implication is unescapable the group controls that post because of its embedded importance    but more important they have the power to keep it
nonetheless when a specific group continues to hold throughout time important positions inside public corporations agencies and branches of the us government a paradigm emerges either the group controls said corporations directlythat is why it is able to do what they want or it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees at any rate considering this type of control the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable
additionally the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect it means that someone within the context of us imperialism has decided that the us public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns in these patterns issues such as israel zionism palestine us imperialism in the middle east wars etc are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter
before continuing i must state that lehrers political views are not a subject to discuss visàvis his program for one the newshour program is not about the personal views of presentersit is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation second whether lehrer had sympathies for israel or zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them nevertheless a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated newscomments the people who deliver them and the people who hear them
firstly planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses to be sure these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries still the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict they also know they can seep to the viewers preconceived ideas through pleasant dialogs affable manners appearance of neutrality and clever circumlocutions
to be fair to lehrer he was consistent in making intelligent questions however he was also consistent at doing something else he would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed it is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the zionist and imperialist discourse in essence a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation
now in his interview lehrer played dumb when he asked buchanan about his bold characterization of the congress he phrased his question as follows you have also said that congress is an israelioccupied territory now what do you mean by that  italics are mine
comment semantically as much as politically buchanans figure of speech was terse and unequivocal he plainly meant that the congress observes israels agenda and acts accordingly there was no need for buchanan to say anything further because what he said had and still has basis in verifiable facts with a question such as what do you mean by that lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from buchanan the form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap buchanan make him retract or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency in essence lehrer had simply tried to deny that israel controls the congress through its amen corner because his what do you mean indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation 
to wrap up the issue without exclusion any denial of the jewish zionist control of the united states is a farce take abraham h foxman of the infamous antidefamation league as an example foxman authored a masterdeceptive propaganda book that he called  the deadliest lies  the israeli lobby and the myth of jewish control italics are mine first foxman lied he knew very well that the jewish zionist control is not a myth but a pervasive reality second but most important the problem is not the abstract jewish control but the specificjewish zionist control this can be explained using a current universal truth hundreds of thousands of jews from all nationalities actively oppose zionism on political religious ethical historical and ideological grounds
foxmans denial means one of two things either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of american jewish zionism or he is very ignorant of the history of zionism  which is impossible either way foxmans business is propaganda demagogy and deception incidentally foxmans denial looks very similar to what some arabs do in the middle east villagersbut even some city folkstry to fend off envy by following an eonold superstition they fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center it appears that foxman and his associates have their own superstition by decrying the deadliest lies against american jewish zionists they try to fend off the accusation or the envy that jewsspecifically jewish zionistshave power and influence
of substance did foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what john foster dulles told william knowland a prozionist senator from california back in february  in an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get israel out of egyptian territory occupied by israel in the suez war dulles pronounced these prophetic words we cannot have all our policies made in jerusalem     that was in  today all those who deride or deny the charge that israel has a say on us foreign policy and wars in the middle east must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying
interestingly years after buchanan made that statement the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity two people vindicated his characterization of capitol hills as an israelioccupied territory and both used his words to make the point the first is a former cia officer philip giraldi and the second is philip weiss founder of mondoweiss website in an article he wrote in  giraldi pointed to the congress as  its still occupied territory  weiss titled a piece he wrote in  as such  capitol hill  still israelioccupied territory 
at this point do american jewish zionists control the united states do they control it as polity or only the political system do they have real influence in setting us foreign policy and wars against the arab and muslim nations or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations

i grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views vietnamese americans as the targets of war ive lived through successive democratic party administrations with little to celebrate the bill clinton era brought nafta which outsourced my aunts union job and forced her into the lowwage service sector my mother never found a living wage job and relied on my fathers public sector union position to meet our familys needs in the st century obama expanded bushs war on terror which merged my fathers job with into the department of homeland security
downward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and i even then my sister and i graduated with large sums of student debt i have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage another four years of a democratic party president was not going to make anything better for my family that is not to say that donald trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation but trumps victory is not the end of the world either
trumps victory is the product of global capitalisms decay millions of people voted for trump for a variety of reasons namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them i dont agree with all of his solutions white nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda trumps call to further militarize the usmexico border yet make peace with russia is a contradiction in and of itself a white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency
however trumps consistency is not the most important aspect of this election millions of people have shown their disgust with the twoparty system of the capitalist class a number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for trump trump also received more votes than expected from the black and latino electorate meanwhile the elections produced a low turnout for clinton from the historic democratic party bases of black voters latino voters and women voters clinton may have won the electoral vote but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on trump trumps base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of democratic party voters who are now without a home the round table of elites called the electoral college could not afford any more damage to the democratic party than what transpired during the election
so the democratic party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it white liberals a large section of the democratic party base wanted bernie sanders to be their next president they did not hold their nose for clinton the legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with trumps racism should not be led into the bowels of the democratic party yet for white liberals this is the ultimate mission
more brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trumps victory has energized the white liberal section of the united states to fight back white liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over clintons loss they then placed blame for trumps victory on russia lowvoter turnout and the white working class white liberals have blamed everyone except hillary clinton and the democratic party now white liberals in the us hope to wage a crusade against trump in hopes of a democratic party recovery it is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both trump and clinton and lead them into the democratic party graveyard
white liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal they speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other they talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests white liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from
white liberals usually originate from the ruling class the managerial class and various stripes of the professionalized sector their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of human rights based on race gender and sexual equality however white liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation in other words the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in us society it has wielded the socalled struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of classconsciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders
the  elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame white liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the trump moment their dominance over the left in the us ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline millions of people voted for sanders based on his demands for material relief millions of people voted for trump for the similar reasons his racism and sexism notwithstanding whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not trump the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him if the trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily they would of voted for ted cruz or jeb bush in the primaries
so white liberal anger about trumps victory is not directed at sexism racism or any other aspect of trumps politics white liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of us society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years where were the white liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by democratic party administrations where were the white liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world the institutions that murder and incarcerate black americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates
the answer is that white liberals were supporting the us capitalist systems assault on the oppressed every step of the way this is what they are trying to hide with their anger over trump we cannot defeat trumps white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor white liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements as it spreads it breeds the germs of democratic party control over these movements but the democratic party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class if a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of trump then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the democratic party and build an independent party of our

china has warned donald trump that he will be defying the wishes of the entire planet if he acts on his vow to back away from the paris climate agreement after he becomes us president next january
the election of climate change skeptic donald trump as president is likely to end the us leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion china
it is global societys will that all want to cooperate to combat climate change a senior beijing negotiator said in morocco on friday at the first round of un talks since the paris deal was sealed last december the chinese negotiators added that any movement by the new us government would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy
china worked closely with the administration of outgoing president barack obama to build momentum ahead of the  paris agreement on climate change the partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly  countries to support the pact at the historic meet in frances capital
by contrast trump has called global warming a hoax created by china to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the united states from the historic climate agreement as well as reverse many of obamas measures to combat climate change

china is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing southsouth partnership particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change
china is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change a gesture that has received wide welcome
speaking to the chinese news agency xinhua moroccan foreign minister and climate change conference cop president salaheddine mezouar said that china has an extremely important role to play in accompanying reinforcing and boosting southsouth partnership and support sustainable development policies in the african continent
xie ji deputy chief of the chinese delegation to the ongoing nd session of the conference of the parties cop  said on nov  that china has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climateresilient we will help build up ten lowcarbon pilot zones launch  climate change mitigation and adaptation projects and offer training programs for  climaterelated professionals he said
what xie called the  project is part of the effort that china has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change the country has earmarked a total of  million yuan about us million since  to help developing countries according to zhang yucheng deputy director of the international cooperation division of the department of climate change of the national development and reform commission ndrc

book review  dr rafiq islam emertec rd ltd dalhousie university halifax nova scotia
 book title true islam jihad and terrorism the science of islamic foreign policy  jaan s islam
 publisher new york nova science publishers
 isbn 
 at a time of politics of fear jaan islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece true islam jihad and terrorism nova science publishers new york  during the  us election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in todays context this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history philosophy and political science this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun jaan islam uses the socalled islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields such an extension was first pointed by islam zatzman and islam  in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculum
more stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars jaan islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist now it has morphed into neoorientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post  world with disinformation and agendadriven research about islamic history the distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value
 although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology it is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition the west does recognize averröes the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands islam as just another religion similar to christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy it is no surprise that with that starting point islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west
chapter  of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely hobbes locke and ibn khaldun in this chapter the author debunks another myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun
in chapter  the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as rashedun caliphs clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the quran they were enacting for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the quran no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the time
similar to chapter  the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter  once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter
in chapter  the author addresses a difficult topic when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topic
often when islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief if it is all that simple why dont islamic scholars have consensus the author handles this topic like a pro in chapter  he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to islam andor scientific cognition process one doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars to anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiislamic nonmuslim scholars
chapter  is where proof of the pudding appears the author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups most interesting is the discussion on current us allies such as saudi arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting arguments
chapter  is the conclusion and recommendation i have studied islam for some  years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion it is important to read the book in sequence
chapter  lists the bibliography and references it is many pages long and is quite comprehensive
chapter  is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformation
anyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology quite interestingly the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam without the roof the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever this depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggression
this book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word islam that means peace through submission to the creator this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world in this sense this book is a manual for

Kim Petersen,2016-11-14T02:00:00.000+02:00,china warns trump against abandoning climate change deal increases climate change aid to developing countries to  b," shares
   
citizens of the united states have chosen the wealthy businessman donald trump as their new president trump who was considered a wild card candidate will take control of the country in january to fill his four year term violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose trump or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise trump supporters have also been attacked to say the very least this is the dawning of a new age in america to put it mildly trump alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign women mexicans muslims blacks the media have all taken their turns at his whipping pole trumps harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
interestingly trump shares many traits with the man who brought germany to its knees during wwii adolph hitler hitler rallied germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups the communists and the jews trump rallied americans by directing high doses of anger toward mexico and muslims trumps perception of mexican immigrants is way off the mark as the majority of those who emigrate to the us are hard working people willing to perform roles most white americans avoid like field harvesting nonetheless trump has described them as rapists and criminals tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the us through illegal means
when it comes to muslims mr trump is exceptionally ignorant he fulfills the thoughts of those in the middle east who already believe the us has a long range plan to eliminate islam
millions of americans are having a meltdown over the election of trump while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously imitate trumps bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view particularly in social media insults have never been so foul and widespread everyone is riled people are unsure of what to do it seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever get better
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired on a positive note trump has backed off on his threat to dismantle obamacare one thing is certain donald trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day unfortunately trump did this when initially exposing the connection between barack obama and hillary clinton and isis
it is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east in syria and libya both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of israel as a wikileaks cable recently confirmed the mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how obama and clinton operate it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than  million a day the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable
the isis expose was a golden moment for trump even though he didnt stick to his guns the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations while the us government spends trillions on killing it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens one great example is saudi arabia the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international lawthese problems have sullied us support for many years
the only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation for clinton maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans parading as a liberal hillary clintons warmongering is legendary the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate bernie sanders was equally reprehensible
in the end there were no good choices for us voters the protrump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr trump does not care about them in any way shape or form only days after the election it is already being announced that the tax cuts trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed it is reminiscent of former us president george bushs famous words read my lips no new taxes of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick each time it was enough to convince republicans trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters perhaps not
in the meanwhile tempers are flaring and americans are increasingly turning against each other the real unavoidable truth is that donald trump will be the next us president he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means in the postwwii years there was peace unless you were black americans had freedom unless they were women or minorities
the united states has always waged illegal wars dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another was broken is donald trump going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years it would be a very good thing if he did
on one hand it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of donald trump but giving up is not the answer if trump goes too far out of sync or becomes embroiled in charges that he cant pay off or threaten away there is an impeachment process that americans can follow",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Xi_Jinping_2_ba318.jpg,bs,china warns trump abandoning climate change deal increases climate change aid developing countries b,shares citizens united states chosen wealthy businessman donald trump new president trump considered wild card candidate take control country january fill four year term violent protests raging attacks oppose trump fail fit criteria acceptability rise trump supporters also attacked say least dawning new age america put mildly trump alienated huge swaths humanity campaign women mexicans muslims blacks media taken turns whipping pole trumps harsh words used condemn huge groups people trump hasnt attacked white american males people trump hasnt attacked white american males interestingly trump shares many traits man brought germany knees wwii adolph hitler hitler rallied germans directing national anger toward two primary groups communists jews trump rallied americans directing high doses anger toward mexico muslims trumps perception mexican immigrants way mark majority emigrate us hard working people willing perform roles white americans avoid like field harvesting nonetheless trump described rapists criminals tossing blanket every human finds way us illegal means comes muslims mr trump exceptionally ignorant fulfills thoughts middle east already believe us long range plan eliminate islam millions americans meltdown election trump supported bid presidency continue express anger simultaneously imitate trumps bully demeanor attacking disagree point view particularly social media insults never foul widespread everyone riled people unsure seems almost certain things going get lot worse could ever get better defeating white liberalism age trump brian cloughley greatest achievement mr trump would engage positive discussions russia china arise president trump end world know trumps sexual predator characteristics grandfather pimp least paid women hired positive note trump backed threat dismantle obamacare one thing certain donald trump extremely willing toss ideas positions change mind following day unfortunately trump initially exposing connection barack obama hillary clinton isis absolute fact united states directly responsible starting two wars middle east syria libya conflicts deadly destabilizing waged request israel wikileaks cable recently confirmed mere idea nations trampled way cements understanding obama clinton operate also speaks volumes dark ways us manipulated zionist government israel nation drains us taxpayers million day track record human rights violations israel goes well beyond unforgivable isis expose golden moment trump even though didnt stick guns wars us waging recent years unjustified conflicts used make large amounts money groups like halliburton mercenary organizations us government spends trillions killing historically ignored suffering allies direct toward citizens one great example saudi arabia radical wahhabi government still beheads people public strict violation international lawthese problems sullied us support many years hope future lies peace reconciliation clinton maintaining peace seemingly impossible task lest forget threats war toward russia iran crossed line large numbers americans parading liberal hillary clintons warmongering legendary democratic national committee debacle derailed promising candidate bernie sanders equally reprehensible end good choices us voters protrump crowd may feel victorious realize mr trump care way shape form days election already announced tax cuts trump promised fraction claimed reminiscent former us president george bushs famous words read lips new taxes course man offered promise election gimmick time enough convince republicans trump promote needs meet goals perhaps political moves coincide wishes voters perhaps meanwhile tempers flaring americans increasingly turning real unavoidable truth donald trump next us president says going make america great many us wonder exactly means postwwii years peace unless black americans freedom unless women minorities united states always waged illegal wars dating back beginning one treaty native people another broken donald trump going keep us wars next four years would good thing one hand seems entirely doubtful country make four years donald trump giving answer trump goes far sync becomes embroiled charges cant pay threaten away impeachment process americans follow,1,,,,,

saudi arabia has warned donald trump that the incoming us president will risk the health of his countrys economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports
over the course of the twoyear american election process republican nominee trump promised on the campaign trail to divest us interests from our foes and the oil cartels referring mainly to the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec of which the ksa is the largest producer and de facto leader
at his heart presidentelect trump will see the benefits and i think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy khalid alfalih  chairman of aramco and saudi aramco oil minister told the financial times in marrakesh where world leaders are currently negotiating the nuts and bolts of the landmark  climate change agreement

halls suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two american academics steven salaita and norman finkelstein both were openly critical of zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous arab populations of the occupied territories both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of palestinian rights and lost their jobs

as radicalism and hatred continue to empty their venom onto the world sowing discord enmity and selfrighteous arrogance a group of shia muslim entrepreneurs from iran saudi arabia pakistan iraq and the us imagined a technology which would speak unity amid furious sectarianism and cohesion where there was distrust
keen not only denounce but oppose the ideological abomination which is wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud rose atop the fanaticism of one heretic scholar muhammad ibn abdelwahhab th century muslims have chosen to anchor their rebuttal of extremism through the promotion of a new media platform messenger 
will likely argue that another social media platform is hardly revolutionary  especially if we consider how many apps are already available this one particular product defiantly taps into a religious movement and expression wahhabist saudi arabia has worked to silence
what in the world am i talking about
i am referring to resistance  more particularly social resistance through the affirmation of islams most sacred and universal principle justice
more why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally letting freedom ring how islams universal message continues to speak through imam husayn ibn ali if islam has often been portrayed as the religion of peace i would personally argue that islam promotes in fact justice  this innate yearning we all share beyond the many labels we have chosen for ourselves at the heart of most
it is our refusal to bow to tyranny and accept oppression which prompted communities of man to rise against the establishment and from the ashes of empires dream themselves free
today such principles have been packaged into an app  several lines of coding put together to defy saudi arabias radical construct a tool to break free from the shackles of religious oppression
who said technology could not be revolutionary
here is where messenger  really promises to break the social sound barrier  beyond a simple exercise in technological entrepreneurship and an imperious need to reject theofascism messenger  carries the very essence of islams tradition in it name arbaeen
arbaeen means  in arabic a reference to the mourning of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad and third imam of islam
a symbol of fortitude courage and exceptional piety imam hussains name has long echoed of islams most brilliant principles  that before tyranny none should relent that even in the most suffocating of darkness it is truth which must be spoken beyond selfinterest and beyond all fears
it is those principles messenger  ambition to promote by speaking freedom in a region locked in oppression  all thanks to saudi arabias desire to project hatred onto a faith it has proclaimed ownership over
should you have missed the momentous act of resistance this one app represents i would like to remind you that saudi arabia still forbids women to drive  that and a few other wonderful vapid social restrictions in a region where being a religious minority often equates to a death sentence thinking freedom is a revolutionary act  never mind speaking tolerance and acceptance
with less than a fortnight to go before arbaeen just as millions are making their way to karbala to remember the martyrdom of their imam he who was claimed by the forefather of terror yazid ibn muawiyah messenger  is preparing its grand launch
haidar attouq a member of the board of developers who refers to himself as a saudi citizen explained how messenger  aims to reform the way muslims think communication by fostering tolerance and peaceful exchange

    donald trump speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland credit gage skidmore  flickr
trumps victory was a shock to most especially given the broad support hillary clinton received from the forces of wall street although trump is a billionaire himself his criticism of free trade agreements and us policy toward russia angered a broad section of the ruling class it is the ruling class in control of the banks military institutions and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the united states trumps victory is a product of the ruling systems decline and crisis more than anything else the question is now what
what is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the trump moment first trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis the laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the us creating the deindustrialized terrain trump spoke so much about in his campaign at the end of the day the profits that wall street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades 
so when hillary clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism few listened many people in the us saw clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground the black lives matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the black prisoner population during her husbands rule hillary clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power
some have claimed that since clinton won the popular vote she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws others have argued that the republican party rightwing elites rigged the election  however true there will be no recall this time around why the dnc and the clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat sanders in a stunning shift of political legitimacy the democratic party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its republican party counterparts
numerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet trump will select indeed trumps possibilities do not deviate from the standard republican party makeup his potential choices for top positions include tough on crime rudy giuliani austerity magnate chris christie and privatization enthusiast newt gingrich however for the first time in a long time the president of the united states is accountable to something other than the ruling class in the past republican party and democratic party presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it this is not the case with trump just a month ago trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class  it was trumps petty bourgeois and working class base of white america that propelled him to victory it is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel trump to choose a neocon administration but a neocon agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white american nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity however nothing less can be expected from the likes of chris christie and newt gingrich
the contradictions of the trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the great depression white liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the twoparty system the neocon establishment will have to confront trumps foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric much of which is in direct antagonism with the gops record and the democratic party will attempt to use the age of trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp
how should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions first the antiwar left needs to confront trumps foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back nato and its escalation toward russia the left needs to resist any and all attempts by trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the us nuclear arsenal of course trumps rhetoric must be placed in its proper context it was the obama administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to modernize the us nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years a number unseen in us history this means resistance to the trump administrations use of the apparatus that obama and the democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class not just one of the two parties that represent it
the vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the twoparty system as don debar of cpr news has made clear the check of white supremacy simply doesnt pay the same dividends anymore while the wealth gap between white america and black american would take over two centuries to even out  it is also true that merely ten percent white america owns almost all wealth in the us  capitalisms crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions a unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the us and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it
what is meant by opportunity is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results it should be imperative that the left force trumps hand on foreign policy it should demand that trump use his executive powers to force through a st century glasssteagall act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the us the left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his administration with full recognition that it was democratic and republican party consensus that got us here as emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the united states the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war

democracy grants people the right to protest to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nations protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world it serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters demonstrations rallies strikes pickets boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting as long as they are within the limits defined by the law protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy freedom of opinion and expression
however in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments
legitimacy of protests and feasibility of demands
democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible justified and feasible  protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met
the antigovernment movement in bulgaria in  confirmed the validity of these qualities the protests took place in three separate cycles january and february witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign they were successful as the requests were sensible a later demonstration was against a government officer and resulted in his resignation yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society
more gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  bombers stopped by police blew themselves up in turkey dispute over kurds and coup attempt threatens usturkey alliance the attempted coup détat made turkey band together the gezi park protests in turkey in the same year followed the same pattern set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first the government heeded the nature lovers voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of gezi park yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature demonstrations that began in gezi park in istanbul and that demanded the preservation of gezi park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government it was a quite clear coup detat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government the protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights but then appealed to nondemocratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation
though justified at the beginning these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of illminded people recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments they bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests which then lead to violent antidemocratic clashes these protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another it all happens in the wake of a governments nonyielding to some dark powers demands and a democratically elected government faces antidemocratic attempts
methods of provocations and otpor
such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media social media becomes an instrument for organizing stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent these illegal subcontractors organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors academicians journalists and members of nongovernmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public
one of the most common groups among these  professional revolutionary organizations  is a serbiabased resistance organizationotpor  independent observers state that otpor organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the usbacked dissident organizations in many countries such as the former yugoslavia serbia georgia bulgaria ukraine egypt brazil and turkey there is a consensus that the cia has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries otpor its offshoot canvas
a relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings otpor 
the otpor s  fistlogo would turn up  years later in the streets of cairo  illustrating further the preposterous foreignbacked nature of the egyptian uprisings serbias otpor would continue receiving funds from the west and become a ciacoup college of sorts under the name of canvas center for applied nonviolent action and strategies 
the research article penned by carl gibson and steve horn and published on occupycom deals with the international financial intelligence and political connections of otpor and features the following information based on wikileaks documents
serbias srdja popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in eastern europe and elsewhere since the lates  and as one of the cofounders of otpor popovic and otpors offshoot canvas have also maintained close ties with a goldman sachs executive and the private intelligence firm stratfor as well as the us government 
such examples are easy to find the internal public opinion on otpor is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the us no wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the us administration speak highly of otpor at every turn moreover the british media rigorously advocates that the executives of otpor have nothing to do with the organization of coups
likewise some turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the  gezi park demonstrations the attempt to occupy the prime ministers residence by armed groups which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law was orchestrated by otpor according to reports yet the media deliberately defined it as the exercise of legitimate democratic rights and freedom of expression by the people and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation these media organs called the nations security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and peoples lives as the socalled enemies of freedom and democracy
in truth such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments divide countries and organize bloody conflicts  and even civil wars  can no longer be called innocent rallies but subtle projects of

coming this weekend over  million pilgrims will rally in the holy city of karbala to mark the greatest pilgrimage of all  arbaeen right at the heart of iraq surrounded by the terror of the black flag army it is communities of men which will gather in prayers and in mourning to perform the last rites of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad
while arbaeen has eclipsed even the hajj in terms of attendance few  even within islam have ever heard of the pilgrimage let alone the tragedy it recalls never mind the principles it saw enacted
arbaeen it needs to be said stands very much an offense to wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud has furiously promoted to assert its ascent to power arbaeen it needs to be emphasised actually speaks of this eternal struggle in between good and evil freedom and slavery piety and dogmatism
 sidelined by mainstream media for it speaks of islams attachment and commitment to such values as justice freedom and compassion towards all men and all fashion of faiths arbaeen has nevertheless towered a beacon of hope amid the furious rise of radicalism arbaeen i would personally argue has become a grand symbol of resistance against oppression  the coming together of communities beyond their differences and most importantly perhaps in spite of their differences so that together they could oppose tyranny and offer the oppressed a rampart behind which to find refuge
for those of you who still have no idea what in the world i am talking about allow me to tell you the story of a man  a man whose courage resolute strength of character and yearning for truth have echoed across the centuries to inspire generations upon generations to think themselves free and to rise themselves independent from the yoke of tyranny
more messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally imam hussain ibn alis martyrdom in the plain of karbala over a millennium ago stands testimony to our collective struggle against injustice and though it is islams banner the third imam carried his message was a universal call for freedom  an immovable promise that real tragedy lies not in our failure to defeat tyrants but in our reluctance to oppose them
allow me to take you back a few centuries back when islams early history was still being written back when the name of the prophet muhammad was still murmured in the present tense through the lips of his progeny the house ahlulbayt
only a few decades after islams last prophets passed islam stood divided as a nationstate its religious sovereignty challenged by men of greed and oppression yazid ibn muawiyah was one of them  arguably the most barbaric of them all since he envisioned slaughter to be the legacy of his throne
as bigots brandished islam to rationalise their heresy and proclaim righteous exceptionalism before the abomination of their deeds imam hussain had no other choice but to march against yazid  even if alone for as long as there was breath in him it is justice he would command for all people
and so the imam marched on  from the holy city of mecca to the thendeserted plain of karbala he walked knowing death would be his fate and still he pushed on 
it is this determination to meet evil and not relent in the task which arbaeen speaks of most loudly it is allegiance loyalty and love pilgrims manifest into reality as they walk towards their imam united not faith but in their humanity
arbaeen you most likely were never told is not exclusive to islam arbaeen is neither shia nor sunni arbaeen is for all who dare think themselves free under god and in him seek refuge
and while arbaeen has long been associated to shia islam for its school of thought revolve around those very principles imam hussain consecrated with his death the pilgrimage stands not in opposition or rejection of any faith  quite the contrary since christians yezidis hussainis brahims alongside countless other religious denominations have year after year centuries after centuries come to karbala to remember
arbaeen is remembrance of hussain ibn ali remembrance of the word of god made complete through hussain the man the prophet muhammad called his son and whose leadership he commanded all believers to forever follow
if many failed in their allegiance for fear rendered them motionless before their imams calls hussains station in karbala has echoed ever since of a love so brilliant and unparalleled that all people all nations all faiths across time and space have found themselves compelled to walk the great walk of arbaeen  and through hussain ibn ali find their humanity
arbaeen i have to say speaks to the best of our humanity it is home after all to the best of humanity  martyr among all martyrs there has never been a day like hussains day  and though his name wahhabism has worked to bury under the rubbles of history karbala has remembered its imam with fierce loyalty
a city build around and for hussain ibn ali karbala is a declaration of allegiance to the house of the prophet  those extraordinary men and women whose hearts lips and prayers have spoken islam in wisdom and piety and without whom we would be orphans
every year without fail karbala has fervently commemorated its imam  even in oppression especially when in oppression
before the poison of radicalism karbala has offered generosity and compassion before brutal repression karbala has opened its doors and to all oppressed offered a shelter before the depravity of sectarianism karbalas pulpits have called upon men and women to hold to rope of allah never to disunite
a city surrounded by the evil of daesh karbala has never shun brighter
in the face of insane fanaticism imam hussains followers have never been braver
and so coming this november   karbala will let out a roar which will shook tyrants thrones karbala will offer all of its prayers and all of its devotion  hussains name will be etched on believers hearts tears of allegiance will flow fists will rise to the sky a promise that when called upon all will answer
islam today is best manifested in karbala since karbala shuns no one karbala today has put saudi arabia to shame since it has provided food and shelter to tens of millions of pilgrims  without expectation without any hope of a thank you
a city has proven more generous and compassionate in its destitution than saudi arabia in its wealth and might where the socalled custodians of islam have cried the weight of the hajj on their coffers karbala has provided beyond the mathematically feasible
in a few short days karbala will stop time once more  so that all could remember all martyrs are in fact alive and that the sons of hussain are still standing vigil",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Protest_against_Donald_Trump_2_22585.jpg,bs,title,shares coming weekend million pilgrims rally holy city karbala mark greatest pilgrimage

shortly after hillary clintons crushing defeat the media came up with another spin zuckerberg and facebook were held responsible for her debacle what crap facebook apparently carried fake news didnt the media invent and promote precisely this kind of news to bounce hillary over the last hurdle its convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and hillarys corrupt campaign organization for her defeat clinton labeled ordinary americans deplorables displaying her contempt for half of the population hillary clinton was favorite puppet of the establishment she was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system and the american people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image an estimated  per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husbands corrupt clinton foundation
the real reason behind the attempt to blame zuckerbergs facebook is that it makes everyone and no one responsible what is posted on facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class they lost control of public opinion established methods of mindcontrol do not work any longer the fawning media report only what they are fed by government spindoctors it is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters this holds true for us media as well of the media class in the european vassal states german media were for example as manipulative as those in the united states they celebrated president obama as the embodiment of good america ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extralegal executions but he possessed a great advantage he was black or if you wish nonwhite obama was thus a nonwhite and smarter version of george w bush
when mark zuckerberg visited berlin in february  he was bootlicked by the german political and media class the springer group the most outspoken mouthpiece of us interests us in germany awarded him the axel springer award of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between zuckerberg and chancellor angela merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against socalled hatespeech on the internet the merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy merkels minister of justice heiko maas has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for hate speech whatever that means
there is no agreed upon definition what hate speech implies hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily the range of hate speech can range from antimuslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call to kill every jewish zionist there is a duty of government under the international convention for the abolition of all forms of racial discrimination to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda ergo there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of hate speech
even restrictions to free speech extend to other spheres such as prohibition of deceitful advertising slandering other people and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in iceland human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values there is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights
in germany this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as klicksafede jugendschutznet gesicht zeigen show your face to name a few the most eminent of these is the amadeu antonio foundation run by a former stasi agent by the name of anetta kahane who claims to fight racism antisemitism and xenophobia today she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of merkels policy of government failure
internet giants such as facebook google and youtube and twitter also participated voluntarily in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up in september  this new censorship body was established in the german ministry of justice and works since then without legal basis the participants agreed on best practices in handling hate messages there are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize hate speach that means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily there are no rules or statutory provisions those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship despite such arbitrary practice the interim results which were presented in the ministry of justice on  september  were not satisfactory google and youtube and facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results from august to september  punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies nevertheless the ministry of justice was not satisfied
thus it is not only the american political class which is blaming facebook for the defeat of its minion hillary clinton but also the german political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on facebook fearing that ordinary people could endanger merkels quest for a renewed mandate as chancellor but what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the deplorables ie the mass of ordinary people do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editorsinchief the attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of facebook and google
at the beginning zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for clintons defeat after a while it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in on friday november   zuckerberg wrote on facebook that the amount of misinformation is relatively small nonetheless there is much work ahead on our roadmap the following work in progress was outlined by him
a stronger detection system the most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation this means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves
 easy reporting making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster
 third party verification there are many respected fact checking organizations and while we have reached out to some we plan to learn from many more
 warnings we are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community and showing warnings when people read or share them
 related articles quality we are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in news feed
 disrupting fake news economics a lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam were looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week and better ad farm detection
 listening we will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input in particular to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them
apparently zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue i beg to differ the issue is not about fake news it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mindcontrol industry owned by a few families on both sides of the atlantic ocean if they lose this control of public opinion they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges
dear mr zuckerberg take courage and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class
when one discusses freedom of expression and the role of facebook one point needs special scrutiny namely the private character of this entity the private character of an entity precludes transparency citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances let alone participate in determining facebook projects and policies as a citizen one cannot accept that one unelected person however nice he may be could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule one can see this operating within wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of  or the israelpalestinian conflict its impossible to even insert critical question because they dont pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control google is another such leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership how such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer the first step would certainly be for civil society without influence from the corporate world to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services it would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this

dr anthony jhall is a professor of globalization studies at the in alberta canada professor hall is the editorinchief of the american herald tribune he is author of several books including a twovolume publishing project at mcgillqueens university press entitled the bowl with one spoon american empire and the fourth world the bowl with one spoon part i mcgillqueens native and northern earth into property colonization decolonization and capitalism the bowl with one spoon part ii mcgillqueens native and northern series the part ii edition was recently selected by the uk independent as one of the best books of  the journal of the american library association called earth into property a scholarly tour de force the books aim to set the  catastrophe and post  wars in the context of global history since  dr hall has been suspended and harshly pulled from his classroom in midterm without any process of arbitration namely for having expressed his viewpoints on israeli crimes calling for an open debate on the holocaust and  despite being promoted to a full professor rank through a process of peer review in an exclusive interview with khameneiir professor hall elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the west
ayatollah khamenei has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive it
i reflected very selfconsciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country canada when i opted in the mid to late s to go to graduate school at the university of toronto with the great canadian historian jms careless as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in  to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there
for the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in  at the invitation of the leroy little bear the chair of the department of native american studies i thus moved to the resourcerich province of alberta once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western canada
in my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first nationsfirst ministers conferences that took place in ottawa between  and  the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase  the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada are hereby recognized and affirmed section  constitution act  
more the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section  was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over canadas constitutional structure from the british imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of canadian federalism
the culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a madeincanada version of the canadian constitution involved my opposition between  and  to what became known as the meech lake accord if this political deal between canadas first ministers had become constitutional law the first nations of canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of canadas fundamental characteristic
in academic essays in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the meech lake accord for fairminded canadians supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an ojicree parliamentarian by the name of elijah harper used his veto power in the manitoba legislature to block the ratification of the meech lake accord because of elijah harpers actions the meech lake accord did not become part of canadas supreme law
i was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of canada until about the year  between  and  i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native american studies towards a field of my own making globalization studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on globalization studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from  until the present
it is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student joshua blakeney that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of palestinian and other arab peoples in the region of greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of  as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me
due to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of  as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century
my quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in  after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action
i have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure
the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions
ayatollah khamenei believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university
i agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between  and  when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations
unfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after  when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on  who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of  specifically and false flag terrorism more generally
as i began to look more deeply into the existing research on  i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in  as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of  led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush  although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of  with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my  studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg
my essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush  our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act  the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals
in pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic
as i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law
this line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy
for sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of  the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of  i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries
in a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards
a gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early  epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonné dieudonné was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days
one of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication
there is a controversial quote from ayatollah khamenei in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia
i agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor
this type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression elaboration and receptiveness indeed we need to make ourselves expert in universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse god curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political

given the mainstream medias constant sensationalized reporting on terror and muslims in the western world the utter lack of coverage of arbaeens march on sunday and monday revealed the double standard that exists in reporting on peaceful muslims
monday marked the final day of the mourning for imam hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph yazid the caliph of umayyad dynasty was promoting the same type of islam as isis and wahhabist preach today
millions of marchers participated in the annual arbaeen procession in karbala the marchers are said to come from over  countries and most of them have marched all the way to karbala from other iraqi cities like najaf and baghdad in a show of devotion each year sunni muslims and followers of other religious groups such as christians join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of imam hussein
arbaeen or mourning is a shia muslim tradition to mark the anniversary of seventhcentury social justice leader imam husain arbaeen is commemorated  days after ashura the martyrdom anniversary of imam hussein as and his companions in  ad however in light of isis terror attacks globally several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms
tens of thousands of muslims have been killed and displaced by isiss declared caliphate an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the west

iraqi troops have been deployed to ensure security for the pilgrims the northern and western parts of iraq have been plagued by gruesome violence ever since isis terrorists began a campaign of terror in the country in june

mohsen abdelmoumen  according to you when we see the numerous demonstrations antitrump in the united states after the election of donald trump at the presidency are we witnessing a colored revolution
wayne madsen it is classic sorosfunded color revolution soros is financing moveonorg black lives matter demos and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators
in your very relevant books devoted to george soros soros quantum of chaos you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world from where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable
soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person evelyn de rothschild along with his family they are all the true puppet masters of the world
soros remains a major element in the antitrump device can trump resist him
more disrespecting the american imperial presidency trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the sorosrothschild puppet masters and certainly not to trump
can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions
secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the sanhedrin and pharisees in palestine and the dionysian cults of the nile valley and the mediterranean region
in your book  isis is us  the shocking truth behind the army of terror you detail the relations between the usa and isisdaesh what is the triggering element that has put you on this trail
trumps national security adviser retired lt gen michael flynn revealed that the us was supporting isis and then he was forced to resign my own sources in the middle east confirmed this long before flynn made his public statement and was fired as defense intelligence agency chief by obama
you mention western sahara and the involvement of the clintons in a deal with the kingdom of morocco while this case is under the authority of un arent the clintons outlaws such bonnie and clyde by supporting morocco against the sahrawi people and the uns resolutions
the clintons received at least  million from the moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to moroccos agenda which includes permanently annexing western sahara as the southern province morocco and israel share the same policy on annexing illegallyoccupied territories
according to your diverse very interesting analysis can we assert that the world government or the false prophets of the new world order are the real decisionmakers of this world
i mentioned a few already sorosrothschild others are the bilderbergs bohemian club and the council on foreign relations and their counterparts
you know very well some american intelligence agencies like the nsa do these intelligence agencies serve the us interests or rather the oligarchys interests
the cia has always served the interests of wall street nsa now serves the interests of the global security network it leads
you were an officer in the us navy was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before
before i was an fbinavy whistleblower in  and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the us navy that reached into the reaganbush white house and was ultimately exposed in the washington times in  my whistleblowing cost me my navy career however and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs
in the recent us election we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls didnt one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes dont we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the new world order and its purely capitalist product globalization
 percent of major newspapers endorsed clinton many alternative news sources supported trump we are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate tv and websites to the alternative media of which waynemadsenreportcom has been prominent since its founding in 
snowden has denounced the prism program and you have denounced echelon both of which serve the interests of the worlds oligarchic caste what is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg
what is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between nsa and private companies like microsoft apple google facebook and major telecommunications companies it is much greater than even snowdens documents describe
the quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings how all these truths have been hidden
the major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events
i advise everyone to read the wayne madsen report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media how do you explain that we who are resisting to what i call the fascist oligarchic caste are called conspiracy theorists is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed
the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in the mids to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of president kennedy it has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into irancontra  and other deep state crimes
your book  the star and the sword  is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the zionist entity of israel and saudi arabia you claim that they organize false flag attacks including the  what is the origin and nature of this israelisaudi strategic alliance do you think that the jasta law will succeed or will it be countered by the zionist allies of saudi arabia do the fact that the usa and the westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the saudis to yemen isnt due to the weight of the lobby zionist
the zionistwahhabisaudi alliance goes back to ibn saud who wrote the british and zionist leaders that he did not oppose a jewish homeland in palestine so long as it did not lay claim to saudi territory on the eastern shore of the gulf of aqaba the relationship has always been close except for the time of king faisal who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative
do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do if so how do you live it

when the dust settled on the nov  election we learned that a completely unpredictable egomaniacal narcissistic buffoon would inherit the white house and the vast powers that go along with it this deeply offended many people who see donald trumps racist and misogynistic rhetoric as unpresidential liberal new york times columnist charles blow summed up this view i respect the presidency i do not respect this presidentelect that the presidentelect should not be respected is a given but why should we respect the presidency
the imperial presidency of the united states has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial arguably the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war the constitution specifically reserves this right for congress the president as commanderinchief directs the wars that congress declares however starting with trumans intervention in the korean war in  and continuing with invasions of vietnam grenada iraq and afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries the presidents ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized congress has not declared war since  despite the fact the us military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world
in recent years george w bush assumed the power to kidnap torture and assassinate any individual anywhere in the world at any time without even a pretense of due process upon replacing bush barack obama legitimized bushs kidnapping and torture by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will noam chomsky said obama has trashed the yearold magna carta which king john of england would have approved of
can there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will while american presidents thankfully do not have the power to unilaterally impose taxes pass legislation or incarcerate without charges inside us borders the illegitimate authority they do possess to carry out unrestrained violence across the world is unquestionably one feature of a dictator
there has not been a single american president since world war ii that has not exceeded his constitutional authority by committing crimes that would meet the standard by which officials were convicted and executed at the nuremberg trials
roosevelts executive order  to imprison japanese americans in concentration camps was a flagrant violation of the fifth amendment right not to be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law
more wayne madsen the cia has always served the interests of wall street trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trumans firebombing of tokyo nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and invasion of korea violated provisions of multiple treaties that are considered the supreme law of the land per article vi of the us constitution
eisenhowers use of the cia to overthrow democratically elected presidents in iran and guatemala as well as the initiation of a terrorist campaign against cuba violated the un charter another international treaty that the constitution regards as the supreme law of the land
kennedy was guilty of approving the creation of a mercenary army to invade cuba as well as covert warfare in vietnam johnson massively escalated us military involvement in vietnam with the introduction of ground troops which he fraudulently justified to the public through misrepresentation of the gulf of tonkin incident
succeeding johnson nixon waged a nearly genocidal air campaign against not only vietnam but cambodia and laos killing hundreds of thousands of people destroying ecosystems across indochina and leaving an unfathomable amount of unexploded ordnance  which continues to kill and maim hundreds of people each year
ford covertly supported the south african invasion of angola and overtly supported the indonesian invasion of east timor carter continued support of the indonesian occupation of east timor as well as providing military support to military dictatorships in guatemala and el salvador reagan oversaw the creation and operation of a terrorist army in nicaragua sponsored military dictatorships throughout central america and directly invaded grenada
bush the elder invaded panama and iraq clinton oversaw sanctions in iraq that killed as many as  million people carried out an air war from  feet against serbia and bombed a pharmaceutical plant in sudan that produced medications for half the country bush the lesser invaded and occupied afghanistan and iraq obama continued both of those wars as well as dramatically expanding the drone assassination program in as many as seven countries
so i beg to differ with blow and anyone else who claims the presidency deserves respect any institution or position that permits such illegal and immoral actions unchecked should be eradicated and replaced with some alternative that does not allow such concentration of power in the hands of a single person
liberal clinton defender matt yglesias argues that from a historical perspective trump is uniquely dangerous past presidents yglesias writes have simply been restrained by restraint  by a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do
it is hard to take such vacuous proclamations with a straight face as we have seen every single american president since at least wwii has engaged in serious violations of international and domestic law to cause death destruction and misery across the world from murdering individuals without due process to unleashing two nuclear bombs on civilian populations in a defeated country that was seeking to surrender
when trump assumes the presidency he will inherit a frightening surveillancemilitaryincarceration apparatus that includes a targeted killing program a vast nsa domestic and international spying network a death squad the joint special operations command and an extralegal system for indefinite kidnapping and imprisonment at guantanamo bay
partisans see a problem only when the presidency is in the wrong hands if obama is at the helm liberals are fine with unconstitutional mass surveillance or killing an american citizen without charge or trial every now and then conservatives trusted bush to warrantlessly surveill americans but were outraged at the snowden revelations
principled opponents recognize that no one should be trusted with illegitimate authority the handwringing and hyperventilation by liberals about the dangers of a trump presidency ring hollow and hypocritical
american presidents long ago became the equivalent of elected monarchs beyond the democratic control of the those they purportedly serve the occupant of the office is able to substitute his own judgments and whims for a universally applicable set of laws and limits on the exercise of power it is what dolores vek describes as actually existing fascism both parties have contributed to it the media has normalized it and the public has accepted its creation and continued existence without rebelling against it its time to stop treating the presidency itself with respect and start actively

the small jump needed for egyptiansyrian relations to go back to normal that syrian prime minister walid almuallem spoke of has been achieved apparently mohammad ballout from assafir lebanese daily  reported that some egyptian military formations have recently arrived to syria signaling an end to the time where egypt simply stood by hands crossed looking at the goingson in syria 
it seems that the egyptians have sent  helicopter pilots to the hamah airbase and it is hoped that they will see action in joint egyptiansyrian operations 
four senior egyptian military figures also joined the unit when it first came to syria and two major generals have been operating at the armed forces staff headquarters in damascus near the operations room the two major generals have been touring the fronts since they arrived a month ago and have been reviewing the efforts made at the fronts most recently the southern front at quneitra 
these new developments are apparently the result of intensive unannounced high profile security meetings that began over a year ago between cairo and damascus arab sources also expect that these developments will go beyond these symbolic operations and will see egyptian task forces operating on a large scale in support of the syrian army 
moreover a senior syrian security official also said that the egyptians have promised to send forces to syria and have schedule postdecember rd as the zerohour whereupon egyptian participation in syria will escalate another official also revealed that after december a large number of egyptian forces will also participate in the syrian operations and their participation will not be limited to aerial support more",english,ahtribune.com,http://ahtribune.com/images/media/Tiffany_Trump_8cc5f.jpg,bs,jordanian bedouin poet proposes tiffany trump asks wear burka,november aht staff egypt says saudi drafts generals pilots fight alongside syrian army isis syria finds new partner fight isis shares small jump needed egyptiansyrian relations go back normal syrian prime minister walid almuallem spoke achieved apparently mohammad ballout assafir lebanese daily reported egyptian military formations recently arrived syria signaling end time egypt simply stood hands crossed looking goingson syria seems egyptians sent helicopter pilots hamah airbase hoped see action joint egyptiansyrian operations four senior egyptian military figures also joined unit first came syria two major generals operating armed forces staff headquarters damascus near operations room two major generals touring fronts since arrived month ago reviewing efforts made fronts recently southern front quneitra new developments apparently result intensive unannounced high profile security meetings began year ago cairo damascus arab sources also expect developments go beyond symbolic operations see egyptian task forces operating large scale support syrian army moreover senior syrian security official also said egyptians promised send forces syria schedule postdecember rd zerohour whereupon egyptian participation syria escalate another official also revealed december large number egyptian forces also participate syrian operations participation limited aerial support,1,,,,,

msm election reporting  you misled your readers blinded by journalistic bigotry  boycott all mainstream media and their lies in their efforts to initiate the overthrow of our republic and their continuing provocations in stirring up civil strife  let the new battle cry for truth be turn them off and tune them out by susan duclos  all news pipeline progressive liberals george soros and his merry band of paid protesters and the mainstream media are certainly giving new meaning to william shakespeares  fight to the last gasp  quote but what none of them seem to realize yet as they cry scream riot and offer their mea culpas is that the fight is over the election is finished their opponents have gone home to celebrate and they are doing nothing but flailing in the wind while grunting incoherentlywhile anyone can see the headlines about the third day of protests and riots and how those that are incapable of understanding quite how elections work and are holding out for a pipedream that maybe they can make electors of the electoral college change their vote what many are missing is how the mainstream media is attempting to suck more air out oxygen tanks that have gone empty and they have no one to blame but themselves the ultimate losers in the  election  the msm for the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream medias unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against donald trump where  percent of the reporting since the partys convention where he was named the gop nominee has been studied and found to have been negative but even before that they treated trump as if he didnt stand a chance to win that nominationwe have noted and reported via wikileaks releases how that very same msm had colluded with the dnc and the clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect hillary clintonwe have also observed and reported how trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist sexist xenophobic islamophobic uneducated uninformed white nationalist deplorables just to name a few of the colorful descriptorshow did that work out for themdespite their biased reporting and throwing everything including the kitchen sink at trump we now have presidentelect donald trump headed for the white house to be sworn in on january   while hillary clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything trump does for the next four maybe  years and progressives will get over their sworn revolution within the party between liberals and moderate democrats the ultimate losers are not clinton supporters celebrities that swore to leave the country if trump won nor democrats as a party it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant crushed by a wave of deplorables and alternative media bypassing their onceinfluential status to communicate without their fasle prism of truth msms last gasp now they are offering their mea culpas dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise and taking their last gasp by swearing to rededicate themselves to reporting honestly while at the same time claiming they reported on both candidates fairlyi kid you notbelow is a letter by arthur o sulzberger jr and dean baquet the publisher and editor of the new york timesfirst point is that if they had been reporting fairly as claimed in the letter above they would not need to rededicate themselves to honesty secondly they did not strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences of trump supporters rather they maligned criticized belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinionwhile it is to be expected that trump supporters verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the times the public editor liz spayd who works independently with the job of examining the times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate heres one that summed up the feelings succinctly from kathleen casey of houston now that the world has been upended and you are all to a person in a state of surprise and shock you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader and nonreaders actually think another letter from nick crawford of plymouth mich made a similar point perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary americans care about rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors he wrote please come down from your new york city skyscraper and join the rest of us what ms spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor the ones that wrote the letter in the image above continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair or to even pretend they attempted to understand and reflect all political perspectives what ms spayd also does not address is the fact that five different new york

wikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about hillary clinton and her staffers but perhaps the most disturbing a bizarre is the fact that john podesta is involved with satanic rituals 
no this isnt fiction and im not wearing tin foil on my head an email released by wikileaks reveals podesta was invited to a spirit cooking dinner by performance artist marina abramovic and you can rest assured that its not anything like it sounds 
i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining all my love marina an email dated june   read 
shortly after the emails which was sent to podestas brother tony was forwarded to john with the message are you in nyc thursday july  marina wants you to come to dinner 
now youre probably wondering what all the fuss is about and i seriously cant blame you so lets turn to paul joseph watson from infowars for a little background on what this spirit cooking is really all about 
spirit cooking refers to a sacrament in the religion of thelema which was founded by aleister crowley and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood breast milk urine and sperm are used to create a painting 
according to marina abramovic if the ritual is performed in an art gallery it is merely art but if the ritual is performed privately then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony 
the video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the recipe for the painting which is comprised of the words with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain 
the ceremony is meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm man and the macrocosm the divine which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in hermeticism as above so below 
below is a video of abramovic conducting the satanic ritual 
how creepy even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goats head  a representation of the satanist symbol baphomet the podestasspirit cooking dinnerits not what you thinkits blood sperm and breastmilk

Brett Macdonald,2016-10-28T00:58:00.000+03:00,breaking hillary just lost the black vote trump is going all the way to the white house,"dean james americas freedom fighters  
last week the pentagon issued a defense department directive that allows department of defense dd personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties 
the defense department has been working on changing the gunfree zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years 
militarycom reports that the directive also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on dod property it authorizes commanders  and aboveto grant permission to dod personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm concealed or open carry on dod property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status 
the directive also makes clear that dod will consider further changes to grant standard authorizations for other dod personnel who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a governmentissued firearm to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on dod property this would allow dod with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander 
kim smith at conservative tribune notes that the policy was a response to an nrabacked provision in the  national defense authorization act that required the defense department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base 
it is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available nra spokeswoman jennifer baker told the washington free beacon  
those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least  years old and meet all federal state and local laws the directive said 
it would appear that the pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which presidentelect donald trump has expressed support 
presidentelect donald trump ran on removing gunfree zones from military bases on july   breitbart news reported that trump pledged to end the gunfree scenarios for us troops by mandating that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases 
the immediate institution of this directive probably left president barack obama incensed but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway and thats good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops which should always be a priority 
let us know what you think about this in the comments below

Sean Brown,2016-11-04T19:14:00.000+02:00,breaking wikileaks reveals hillarys campaign chair engages in satanic rituals,"posted on october   blacks and liberals want to abolish science dan roodt american renaissance october   the south african fallist movement finds another target 
on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country 
my swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide 
but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society 
south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face 
the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall 
in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying 
if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens 
the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism 
this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  
needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well 
in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation 
miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo 
although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  
i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that 
miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  
mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried 
the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     
in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them 
but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor 
unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg 
in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues 
we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge 
he adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her 
are south african blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the dark arts as harry potter would say if they have tooth aches or appendicitis i suspect they will submit to the humiliation of colonial science rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of

Dean James,2016-11-23T22:06:00.000+02:00,breaking trump just gave obama horrible news check out what the pentagon just did,"a lot of people in the us are suddenly identifying as white eric d knowles and linda r tropp quartz october   
many political commentators credit donald trumps rise to white voters antipathy toward racial and ethnic minorities however we believe this focus on racial resentment obscures another important aspect of racial thinking 
in a study of white americans attitudes and candidate preferences we found that trumps success reflects the rise of white identity politicsan attempt to protect the collective interests of white voters via the ballot box whereas racial prejudice refers to animosity toward other racial groups white identity reflects a sense of connection to fellow white americans 
were not the first to tie trumps candidacy to white identity politics  but our data provide some of the clearest evidence that ongoing demographic changes in the united states are increasing white racial identity white identity in turn is pushing white americans to support trump 
white identity 
when we talk about white identity were not referring to the altright fringe the white nationalist movement or others who espouse racist beliefs rather were talking about everyday white americans who perhaps for the first time are racially conscious 
snip 
nonhispanic whites are projected to become a minority in the year  this increasing diversity across the country is making whites own race harder and harder to ignore snip

as whites increasingly sense that their status in society is falling  white racial identity is becoming politicized trumps promise to make america great again speaks to these anxieties by recalling a past in which white people dominated every aspect of politics and society snip 
snip 
to test our ideas about trump and white identity politics we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about  white americans the survey covered racial identities attitudes and political preferences in examining the relationship between white identity and ethnic diversity we chose to focus on an ethnic minority of particular salience in contemporary politics hispanics snip 
do whites from heavily hispanic neighborhoods show stronger white racial identity to measure identity we used a widelyused questionnaire  on a fivepoint scale participants rated their agreement with items such as being a white person is an important part of how i see myself and i feel solidarity with other white people as shown in the graph below there is a positive relationship between exposure to hispanics and white respondents sense of racial identity 
and does white identity lead to support for donald trump we examined the relationship between white identity and respondents likelihood of supporting trump for the presidency versus hillary clinton or several republican primary challengers consistent with others analyses  white identity strongly predicts a preference for trump 
whites at the high end of the racial identity scale are more than four times as likely to support trump than those at the low end of the scale perhaps thats because whites highest in racial identity are also the ones most likely to harbor negative attitudes against latinos indeed we found white identity was significantly correlated with another characteristicprejudice 
however differences in prejudice dont explain the relationship between white identity and trump support the pattern in the figure above was tested while statistically controlling for levels of antihispanic prejudice because the relationship between identity and support for trump remains strong we are confident that white identity independently predicts greater trump support 
weve seen that living close to hispanics leads whites to develop a strong sense of racial identity and that strong racial identity is associated with support for donald trump we should therefore expect that whites in heavily hispanic neighborhoods support trump more often than those in neighborhoods with fewer hispanics this prediction gains credence from work by political scientist ryan enos who finds that everyday exposure to latinos can increase support for restrictive immigration policies 
whites support for donald trump is in fact greatest in areas with a large hispanic population

how i wish it were the dodgers who took the field tuesday night in cleveland yes were all sad in los angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the th anniversary of its last world series appearance but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride 
the dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the indians but also resurrected the laughably racist redfaced mascot chief wahoo just in time for the playoffs 
for those who havent kept up with the baseball drama heres a summary the cleveland team drew the curtain on its regularseason minstrel show in the spring having replaced chief wahoo on its caps with a vintage red c it never officially retired the offending mascot but wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the nfls washington redskins remained defiantly in the dark and was easing its fans into the postindians era 
or so we thought chief wahoo reappeared when the cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the boston red sox and he hasnt left he remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the toronto blue jays even surviving a legal attack by advocates of canadas indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term indians while the team was on canadian soil 
snip 
its tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city thats had it as rough as cleveland the cubs championship drought has famously lasted for  baseball seasons but the cleveland team boasts a pitiable  years without a world series title beyond sports clevelands decline as an important american metropolis is arguably unmatched having tumbled from a population peak of plus in  to less than  today snip

organized by george s qiao  the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the japanese stereotypes and appropriation of japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted productions storyline but later qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the players 
i fully believe that members of the gilbert and sullivan players put their blood sweat and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production qiao said however i believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement with this plays history of japanese cultural misrepresentation

Henry Wolff,2016-10-28T06:29:00.000+03:00,chinese immigrants demand protection from paris muggers,"posted on october   media selfdestruct over trump jared taylor american renaissance october   their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired 
from the start of donald trumps campaign the media have covered him dishonestly they have consistently portrayed him as a closet white supremacist who deliberately appeals to racists they have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the altright they are now working on another dishonest angle that donald trump is mainstreaming hate and bringing racism into public discourse the media clearly want to stampede voters into mrs clintons camp so as to spare us the agony of a racist in the white house 
the demonization campaign has backfired by trying to hang racial dissidents around donald trumps neck the media have given american renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before at the same time constant shouts of racist and bigot dont seem to hurt mr trump instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility the biggest irony though is that donald trump is probably not one of us at all but even small deviations from the castiron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about donald trump as a secret david duke fan 
media dishonesty started immediately when mr trump pointed out that some immigrants from mexico were criminals the press acted as if he had said all mexican immigrants are criminals then when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call haters and white supremacists liked mr trump there was no end of articles with titles such as  meet the horde of neonazis klansmen and other extremist leaders endorsing donald trump   top racists and neonazis back donald trump   heil donald trump neonazis white supremacists show support  and  the white nationalists who support donald trump  
these articles had a simpleminded purpose discredit mr trump by parading before the reader any nazi kluxer or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate the implication was that if racists were going to vote for donald trump he must be racist too 
this was deceitful and onesided when the chairman of the american communist party endorsed hillary clinton  no one suggested this meant she was a communist 
it is true that mr trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet bigot because he did not repudiate racists with the snorts of indignation respectability requires there was the famous exchange in february when a reporter pushed mr trump to disavow an endorsement from david duke as the hill reported it  david duke endorsed me ok alright i disavow ok trump said seeking to quickly move on to another question 
that same month there was another famous exchange with jake tapper of cnn  
tapper  will you unequivocally condemn david duke and say that you dont want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election 
donald trump  well just so you understand i dont know anything about david duke ok i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists so i dont know i dont know did he endorse me or whats going on because you know i know nothing about david duke i know nothing about white supremacists 
the media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy trump refuses to disavow white supremacists thats because he is one 
there are far better explanations first donald trump is a pugnacious man he doesnt like being pushed around by anyone especially not by journalists who hate him if mr tapper had belligerently demanded that mr trump agree that the sky is blue mr trump would have bridled at that 
second donald trump probably doesnt know anything about david duke or white supremacy i would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of david duke or any other alleged white supremacist it is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers not some carefully concealed racial consciousness 
the press has also pounced on donald trumps retweets of racist material which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist business insider for example published this shocking story   times donald trump has engaged with altright racists on twitter  not one of these tweets is obviously racist and it would be surprising if mr trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets realdonaldtrump has sent during the campaign 
now the press is working on another smeartrump angle recently i have been contacted by journalists from such places as bloomberg news reuters and the new york times  who clearly want to write that donald trump is mainstreaming hate that he is responsible for a huge surge in the altright they want to know about all the people who have been flocking to amrencom because of what donald trump says they want me to tell them about people who have been emboldened to speak out against minorities because donald trump has led the way they would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting nigger because mr trump wants to take a hard look at muslim immigrants 
i have explained to them as patiently as i can that they have it the wrong way around no one comes looking for amrencom because donald trump wants to build a wall they come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that mr trump is a racist they come looking for us because mrs clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the altright and her basket of deplorables i also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold donald trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him few people would have heard of the altright in their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors they are promoting the altright not donald trump 
i explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign it is trayvon martin michael brown black lives matters and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way not donald trump this will not change whether mr trump wins or loses the top landing pages on amrencom are analyses of race and crimesomething mr trump never talks about 
i also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think mr trump has mainstreamed hate by which they mean sensible observations about race i ask them to name a single person who has been emboldened to say something racist just because donald trump is the gop nominee of course they cant if anything it is the opposite mr trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest most commonsense observations about muslims and immigration anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever things could change if mr trump becomes president but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas 
what donald trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that mitt romney and john mccain are no different from barack obama when it comes to preserving whites their society and their culture i know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in november i know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the trump campaign 
i point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about giving the voters real choices i note that the trumpclinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election havent our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement especially among the young well now they have engagement alright but they dont like it they dont like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a  threat to democracy  liberals are such transparent hypocrites they claim to love democracy but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to 
the whole trumpisaracist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become i may be wrong but i have no reason to think donald trump thinks at all as we do he has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary american with normal instincts he doesnt want criminals sneaking across the border he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy he doesnt see why we need more muslims and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare millions of ordinary americans clearly agree with him and not because they are racially aware it is because they are decent fairminded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways 
i am convinced that mr trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race so far as i can tell he doesnt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything he has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time but not because he is one of us 
maybejust maybehe will move in our direction its not impossible to imagine a president trump asking in an offhand way whats wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the united states or he might casually note that you cant expect as many blacks as asians in ap classes because they dont have the same levels of intelligence but i can imagine the opposite too president trump so bogged down in beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall 
there is one thing that donald trump has changed he has proven that republican bromides about taxes and small government dont excite people he has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties he has proven that americans do want their country to come first they dont want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries 
and even if he has not mainstreamed racism he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an american on october  roger cohen wrote in the new york times that donald trump is a phony liar blowhard cheat bully misogynist demagogue predator bigot bore egomaniac racist sexist sociopath and a dictatorinwaiting with a brats temper and a prigs scowl this must be one of the most unhinged hysterical outbursts in the history of american political journalism and it is unusual only for its wordiness not its tone 
dont the editors of the times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more americans believe in bigfoot  percent than trust newspapers  percent virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at donald trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself open petulant bias is driving more and more americans to social media and to sites like amrencom for their news 
despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire american ruling class donald trump is going to get close to half of the vote on november  some  million people are going to vote for a man for whom roger cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult only one major newspaper has endorsed donald trump only one  and this is a man whom the american people might choose as their president what better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion between what americans think and what our rulers want us to think donald trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity 
whether he wins or not whether he is one of us or not donald trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors votersfinallyhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system on november th they could bring it crashing down but even if it still stands it is visibly

kansas state rep joe seiwert commented on facebook that an africanamerican singer who knelt while performing the star spangled banner at a miami heat game should go back to where she claims as home 
seiwert rpretty prairie posted that comment and a longer followup on an antiblack meme that was originally posted to a prodonald trump facebook group and then shared by one of seiwerts constituents 
seiwert confirmed the comments were his and said he was exercising his first amendment right to free speech as he says the woman in the meme did when she wore a black lives matter tshirt and knelt while singing the anthem 
snip 
the photo in the meme is of denasia lawrence a miami social worker and according to the miami sunsentinel a parttime gamenight employee of the heat professional basketball team the team has issued a statement saying team officials were unaware that lawrence planned to protest when they asked her to sing the anthem at fridays preseason game with the philadelphia ers 
snip 
to which seiwert responded i am where i claim home and like it they want to claim it and it is their right to go where ever they like so if they dont like it here i believe that their freedom completely allows them to go wherever they believe is more free and non racist if thats what they believe 
seiwert said he didnt see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didnt do anything wrong 
i have a personal life besides a legislative life he said maybe it was inappropriate i dont believe so because i said nothing derogatory and i believe that if people are that upset with the national anthem they can do whatever they want to on their own time but when theyre using it on national tv to make a statement thats not right 
i said if she lawrence doesnt like it here then go where she would like it whats wrong with that he said 
asked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are seiwert responded because maybe theres other people who dont want their place changed 
he also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race 
it dont make any difference if theyre black white or green its the disrespect to our country he said and why does everybody put the color to it 
snip 
the person who made the meme took a photo of lawrence from the web and added in capital letters kneeling while singing the national anthem    im so sick of these antiamerican blacks    expletive black lives matter

to many donald trumps pledge to build a wall along the usmexico border is unrealistic but for jim chilton its the only way hell get a good nights sleep 
the yearold a fifthgeneration rancher on the arizona border with mexico says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglersrather than just cattleon his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles 
i really admire trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know whats wrong with the current border system he said as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his squaremile ranch that stretches to the mexican border 
we need a wall ive been saying that for  years    and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in he added it would make my life so much better and id feel more secure 
snip 
chilton who admits that trump was not his first choice among the republican candidates for the white house says building a barrier to secure the mile kilometer usmexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security 
snip 
i live in a nomans land i live in a land that is occupied by the sinaloa drug cartel he sighed pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers 
i have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before    and even in my front yard he said i wave at them and they often yell hola and wave back 
chiltonwho keeps a gun holstered on his hip a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedsideadded that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like islamic state is may be using them to slip operatives into the united states 
snip 
but beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism chilton insists that trumps wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons 
its just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch its outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and its outrageous for my cowboys he said referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the us through the brutal desert 
this is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue 
snip 
according to the us border patrol nearly  bodies have been recovered since  from the desert in the tucson arizona sector which covers  miles of the border

Henry Wolff,2016-10-29T04:39:08.112+03:00,ers fans care more about victories than kaepernick,"dutch antiislam mp wilders to snub hate speech trial afp october   
defiant dutch antiislam politician geert wilders said friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for  elections 
the trial opens on monday before a threejudge bench with the farright politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about moroccans living in the netherlands 
it is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country wilders said in a statement friday dubbing the case a political trial in which i refuse to cooperate 
it comes as opinion polls have shown his farright freedom party pvv doing well ahead of march elections 
after riding high amid the migrant crisis the party is now polling neckandneck with prime minister mark ruttes liberals each predicted to win between  to  seats in the seat parliament 
set to last until november  the trial focuses on a comment made at a march  rally when wilders asked supporters if they wanted fewer or more moroccans in your city and in the netherlands 
when the crowd shouted back fewer fewer wilders answered were going to organise that 
snip 
wilders said friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer geertjan knoops and instead go to work in the parliament in the hague 
snip 
judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by wilders lawyers that the trial was politically motivated adding they did not believe it will impact the pvvs election campaign 
politicians are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position the judges ruled last month 
precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements 
wilders hit back friday saying it is a travesty that i have to stand trial because i spoke about fewer moroccans 
millions of dutch citizens  percent of the population want fewer moroccans he claimed 
not because they despise all moroccans or want all moroccans out of the country but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many moroccans

snip according to misao dean professor of english at the university of victoria the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism imperialism and genocide due to history she also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society 
in a radio interview for cbc radio  which wasnt picked up by the internet until several months later she claimed we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol something that seems natural that seems ordinary and seems to promote values that we ascribe to

call it the crisis of whiteness 
white anxiety has fueled this years political tumult in the west britains surprising vote to exit the european union donald j trumps unexpected capture of the republican presidential nomination in the united states the rise of rightwing nationalism in norway hungary austria and greece 
whiteness in this context is more than just skin color you could define it as membership in the ethnonational majority but thats a mouthful what it really means is the privilege of not being defined as other 
whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance traditions religion and even food are the default norm its being a person who by unspoken rules was long entitled as part of us instead of them 
snip 
its fundamentally about who are we said eric kaufmann a professor of politics at birkbeck college university of london what does it mean to be part of this nation is it not our nation anymore our meaning the ethnic majority 
these kinds of questions are really front and center even though theyre not necessarily verbalized 
the questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism through the civil rights movement in the united states and the european unions opening up of borders 
snip 
white peoples officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in say university admissions but rising wages an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents and confident that their children would do better still 
that feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself 
but as western manufacturing and industry have declined taking many workingclass towns with them parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation 
that creates an identity vacuum to be filled 
for someone who is lower income or lower class professor kaufmann explained youre going to get more selfesteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity 
snip 
a recent gallup study found that mr trumps supporters tend to earn aboveaverage incomes for their communities but also tend to live in majoritywhite areas where children are likely to be worse off than their parents 
snip 
the formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has by extension constructed a new broader national identity the united states has a black president london has a muslim mayor of pakistani descent 
but that broadening can to some feel like a painful loss articulated in the demand voiced over and over at trump rallies probrexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout europe i want my country back 
the mantra is not all about bigotry rather being part of a culture designed around peoples own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance of belonging 
the loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that robin diangelo a lecturer and author calls white fragilitythe stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default that whiteness is just a race like any other 
fragility leads to feelings of insecurity defensiveness even threat and it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders 
snip 
for decades the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy when that became taboo it left white identity politics without a vocabulary 
if you are a workingclass white person and you fear that the new cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis 
some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns trade crime the war on drugs controlling the borders fear of islamist terrorism all are significant in their own right and create very real fears for many people but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what societys changes mean for white majorities 
snip 
there will not likely be a return to the whiteness of social dominance and exclusive national identity immigration cannot be halted without damaging western nations economies immigrants who have already arrived cannot be expelled en masse without causing social and moral damage and the other groups who seem to be cutting in line are in fact getting a chance at progress that was long denied them

when susan benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence her research took her to farflung places like kenya and burma 
lately shes been unable to ignore a case study at home in the united states 
the american university law professor and harvard university faculty associate has grappled for months with whether donald trumps rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it she has examined electionyear speech before but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great 
but in the past week with trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups she said 
benesch  has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech to rise to that level at least two of these five indicators must be true a powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience the audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate a speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence a social or historical context that is propitious for violence for any of a variety of reasons including longstanding competition between groups for resources lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence a means of dissemination that is influential in itself for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience 
trumps speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it benesch said in a recent interview the meaning is so often ambiguous 
but when trump said his supporters could use the second amendment against hillary clinton it seems to me impossible that people didnt understand that as a reference to violence she said or when he suggested that clinton and president obama were founders of the islamic state something he alluded to again at wednesdays final debate that was a hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an ingroup member as the enemy she said 
and now with trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him hes definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting direct incitement of violence is illegal but trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience 
because of that its still a gray area that surrounds whether trump does use dangerous speech 
trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of us democracy benesch said some of themthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messagesmay therefore be more likely to commit violence however the united states is not in danger of mass intergroup violence in my view it is deeply irresponsible though since it can undermine some americans belief in our own democratic institutions which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward

we dont often hear about these particular refugees or asylumseekers do we they are to borrow a term from british historian mark curtis unpeople the poor nonwhite residents of the developing world who tend to be ignored by the western media 
where is the rolling coverage of kenyas dadaab camp for example dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world but in a move that could displace as many as  people  kenyan authorities are in the process of closing it down it puts the recent british media frenzy over the socalled jungle camp in calais france with its  migrants into some perspective doesnt it

Henry Wolff,2016-11-05T00:24:00.000+02:00,obsessing over europes refugee crisis while ignoring africas is white privilege at work,"loading posted on november   putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values jennifer newton daily mail november   
vladimir putin has waded into the migrant crisis condemning europes handling of asylum seekers and saying a case of child rape in austria dilutes national values 
the russian president has largely kept quiet over the refugee crisis in europe but has now spoken out of his disbelief over its handling claiming that a continent that cant protect its children has no future 
his comments come off the back of a case in austria last week which saw an iraqi migrant have his conviction of raping a yearold boy at a swimming pool in vienna overturned 
he was originally convicted of the crime but it was overturned because a court didnt prove he realised the boy was saying no 
it came after the migrant identified as yearold amir a claimed that it was a sexual emergency because he had not had sex for four months 
a second trial for the rape is expected to take place next year but the attacker is likely to remain in custody until then 
and speaking at a press conference this week putin slammed europes migration policy and cited the case where the victim was from a serbian family living in austria 
he said in a european country a child is raped by a migrant and the court releases him 
it doesnt fit into my head what on earth theyre thinking over there 
i cant even explain the rationaleis it a sense of guilt before the migrants whats going on its not clear 
he also claimed that the case highlighted the dissolution of traditional national values adding a society that cannot defend its children has no future 
and putins words appeared to have struck a chord as he is extremely popular with serbs 
in the rape case the boy had arrived in austria with his serbian mother who paid for him to go to the theresienbad swimming pool where he was violently attacked 
the boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the iraqi mans second trial outraging the austrian serbian community 
austrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers who were previously divided about whether to vote for the leftleaning green party candidate or the far right option nobert hofer in upcoming elections 
however it is not the first time russia has lashed out at the eus handling of the migrant crisis 
in march konstantin romodanovsky head of russias federal migration service accused leaders of willfully ignoring cultural differences that have caused such widespread friction and chaos across the continent 
he also added that multiculturalism has failed because europe never formed a unified strategy to integrate refugees into western society 
he said the european commission left it up to individual nations to decide how they want to treat asylum seekersdespite the fact the policies and capabilities of member states are very different 
romodanovsky also accused eu countries of ignoring the differences in culture religious traditions and customs with the refugees the vast majority of whom are islamic",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,obsessing europes refugee crisis ignoring africas white privilege work,loading posted november putin condemns europes handling migrants says child rape austria shows dilution national values jennifer newton daily mail november vladimir putin waded migrant crisis condemning europes handling asylum seekers saying case child rape austria dilutes national values russian president largely kept quiet refugee crisis europe spoken disbelief handling claiming continent cant protect children future comments come back case austria last week saw iraqi migrant conviction raping yearold boy swimming pool vienna overturned originally convicted crime overturned court didnt prove realised boy saying came migrant identified yearold amir claimed sexual emergency sex four months second trial rape expected take place next year attacker likely remain custody speaking press conference week putin slammed europes migration policy cited case victim serbian family living austria said european country child raped migrant court releases doesnt fit head earth theyre thinking cant even explain rationaleis sense guilt migrants whats going clear also claimed case highlighted dissolution traditional national values adding society cannot defend children future putins words appeared struck chord extremely popular serbs rape case boy arrived austria serbian mother paid go theresienbad swimming pool violently attacked boy badly injured needed hospital treatment forced go back court iraqi mans second trial outraging austrian serbian community austrian media say case hardened communities position asylum seekers previously divided whether vote leftleaning green party candidate far right option nobert hofer upcoming elections however first time russia lashed eus handling migrant crisis march konstantin romodanovsky head russias federal migration service accused leaders willfully ignoring cultural differences caused widespread friction chaos across continent also added multiculturalism failed europe never formed unified strategy integrate refugees western society said european commission left individual nations decide want treat asylum seekersdespite fact policies capabilities member states different romodanovsky also accused eu countries ignoring differences culture religious traditions customs refugees vast majority islamic,1,,,,,
Henry Wolff,2016-11-05T00:24:00.000+02:00,harvard cancels mens soccer season after finding sexually explicit reports continued through,"when the river ran red arthur kemp american renaissance september  
the year is  dodging a flurry of spears the boer commander andries pretorius rides forward to seize a zulu warrior in the midst of an epic battle between more than  warriors and just  boers pretorius has decided to take a zulu alive he wants to send the captive back to his king dingaan to convey surrender terms to the zulu nation 
the warrior has no intention of being taken alive and jabs viciously at pretorius with his assegai this is a zulu spear normally a longshafted throwing weapon but the warrior broke its shank earlier for closequarter stabbing pretorius gives up on capturing the zulu and tries to shoot him 
with a singleshot muzzleloading musket he has only one chance of a hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror pretorius sees the smoketrailing ball whiz past the zulus ear at the same time the zulu lunges forward causing pretoriuss horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground 
leaping to his feet he meets the attacking zulu who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai pretorius is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun 
spinning round the zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down as he has been trained to do in the zulus disciplined army it is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home but pretorius sees it coming he grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cuts deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the zulu to pull it out pretorius seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him 
the zulu struggles and with the help of two good hands is about to break free when one of pretoriuss men comes upon the scene he pulls the assegai out of the commanders hand and plunges it into the zulus side ending the struggle 
pretorius remounts and heads back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between boers and zulus has already been won the main zulu army has been broken in two and the river that runs along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously as the ncome will be renamed blood river pretorius knows that the zulu defeat which will include some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier 
prelude to war 
the great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers 
the boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island 
when they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own 
for just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness 
it only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value 
exasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west 
the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable 
retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples 
he sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaans capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boers 
retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed 
as they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed 
the zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to dingaan as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom 
dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping 
the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her 
the slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if dingaans men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater 
pretorius arrives 
the boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni 
this new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith 
it was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu 
his means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager 
pretorius realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon 
on december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy 
there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december  pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner 
pretorius drew up a message for dingaan on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however dingaan was willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer 
on december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle 
pretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties pretorius now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle 
on december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away 
pretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack 
the laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a pretorius innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night 
battle is joined 
in pretoriuss own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it was a terrible sight 
the boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day 
the front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades 
the boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses 
another group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side 
the boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment 
as the zulus waited for new orders pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading 
as the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered 
a reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled 
pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that pretorius was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds 
the aftermath 
early the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power 
on the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box pretoriuss men buried retief and his party on christmas day  
dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory 
the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes 
yet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms 
the boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants 
to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans 
the church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaans capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black 
the church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different 
if the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers 
the only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,harvard cancels mens soccer season finding sexually explicit reports

Henry Wolff,2016-11-05T00:24:00.000+02:00,putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values,"posted on november   how hillary courts the black vote ethnomasochism reaches a new low 
the democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the nonwhite vote as the guardian summed up one of the debates hillary clinton and bernie sanders made a conspicuous play for latino and african american voters mrs clinton won the conspicuous play hands down and with it the nomination the failure of senator sanders to win the necessary quotient of nonwhite votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out 
in february one black commenter pointedly wrote that sen sanders has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests by may black commenter steven thrasher wrote a piece titled  bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes  and its his own fault  mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem as failing to talk about racism at every turn 
this accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered his stage to black lives matter activists several times but in comparison to mrs clinton mr thrasher was right about sen sanders no mainstream candidate in the history of the united states has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than mrs clinton since this helped her win the democratic nomination she has continued the strategy in the few days remaining before november th lets take a look at hillary clintons most ethnomasochistic moments 
 in january of  mrs clinton was at something called the iowa brown and black forum with none other than jorge ramos  where she was asked can you tell us what the term white privilege means to you and can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it this is how she began her answer 
where do i start i think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youre standing on the shore perhaps watching     i was born white middleclass in the middle of america    
 early in the democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of bernie sanders 
whereas the electorates in iowa and new hampshire are largely ruralsuburban and predominantly white the march primary states better reflect the true diversity of the democratic party and the nation     it will be very difficult if not impossible for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters we believe thats how it should be emphasis added 
 shortly before the south carolina primary at schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem mrs clinton explained how to break down barriers for african americans 
ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usespecially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves white americans need to do a better job of listening when african americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day 
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences all of us need to bring our skills to bearand especially young people coming up today who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems 
 in april of  while on a back radio show mrs clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag she immediately answered hot sauce when one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer she asked hopeully is it working 
 just a few weeks after a black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers  the democratic national convention that convened to nominate mrs clinton passed a resolution no doubt with her approval supporting black lives matter  
the dnc joins with americans across the country in affirming black lives matter and the say her name efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed african american men women and children 
white politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades but this election has set a new low and if mrs clinton loses her pandering could live on in another form as the black lives matter activist tef poe explained  if mr trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go    aint no more rules weve been too nice as is",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,putin condemns europes handling migrants says child rape austria shows dilution national values,posted november hillary courts black vote ethnomasochism reaches new low democratic presidential primary one unprecedented pandering nonwhite vote guardian summed one debates hillary clinton bernie sanders made conspicuous play latino african american voters mrs clinton conspicuous play hands nomination failure senator sanders win necessary quotient nonwhite votes repeatedly pointed chattering class time dropped february one black commenter pointedly wrote sen sanders many miles go convince black voters fight interests may black commenter steven thrasher wrote piece titled bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes fault mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem failing talk racism every turn accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered stage black lives matter activists several times comparison mrs clinton mr thrasher right sen sanders mainstream candidate history united states thoroughly debased quest black vote mrs clinton since helped win democratic nomination continued strategy days remaining november th lets take look hillary clintons ethnomasochistic moments january mrs clinton something called iowa brown black forum none jorge ramos asked tell us term white privilege means give example life career think benefitted began answer start think hard swimming ocean know exactly happening around much youre standing shore perhaps watching born white middleclass middle america early democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released memo aimed stifling rising momentum bernie sanders whereas electorates iowa new hampshire largely ruralsuburban predominantly white march primary states better reflect true diversity democratic party nation difficult impossible democrat win nomination without strong levels support among african american hispanic voters believe thats emphasis added shortly south carolina primary schomburg center research black culture harlem mrs clinton explained break barriers african americans ending systemic racism requires contributions usespecially us havent experienced white americans need better job listening african americans talk seen unseen barriers face every day need recognize privilege practice humility rather assume experiences everyones experiences us need bring skills bearand especially young people coming today passion social justice helping create new ways solve intractable problems april back radio show mrs clinton asked always carries bag immediately answered hot sauce one black hosts noted would accused pandering black people giving answer asked hopeully working weeks black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers democratic national convention convened nominate mrs clinton passed resolution doubt approval supporting black lives matter dnc joins americans across country affirming black lives matter say name efforts make visible pain fellow sister americans condemn extrajudicial killings unarmed african american men women children white politicians tried win elections public displays ethnomasochism decades election set new low mrs clinton loses pandering could live another form black lives matter activist tef poe explained mr trump wins young niggas fully hell bent inciting riots everywhere go aint rules weve nice,1,,,,,
AR Staff,2016-11-06T16:03:07.410+02:00,when the river ran red,"why obama will win jared taylor american renaissance august  
it is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the united states will be black why will a nation we are so often assured is racist elect a black president and will it make a difference 
ever since hillary clinton dropped out of the race the polls have reported consistently that barack obama will beat john mccain the media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign mr obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat mr mccain why will so many whites vote for mr obama 
first some support his policies they want to end the war in iraq and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine higher taxes more handouts and more government there has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way and they have a clear favorite in mr obama 
second as many people have pointed out an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a blacknot for an outandout race man such as jesse jackson or al sharpton but for an unthreatening wellscrubbed black who speaks standard english and promises to bring us together even if they live sharply segregated lives whites thrill to the language of coming together and they adore blacks who dont act or sound black 
for many whites voting for mr obama will be an act of high patriotism electing him will prove america is not racist and many whites believe that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous most would rather lose a leg than be thought a bigot and a vote for obama is a painless way to burnish antiracist credentials 
third young whites will line up for mr obama they have been swallowing antiwhite multiculti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false some who know their parents will vote for mr mccain will make a special point of voting for mr obama every new generation thinks it is cooler hipper and wiser than any generation that ever lived and what could be cooler hipper or wiser than putting a black man in the white house for many young whites a vote for mr obama will be a denial of every uncool unhip and especially every even faintly racerealist thing their parents ever said or did 
fourth although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks americans think everything is historic whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made if you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first apple iphone he will tell you its a historic product americans love anything that is historic and for people who think a few more stolen bases are history right up there with the battle of lepanto putting a black man in the white house will be the discovery of america pearl harbor and the second coming all rolled into one many whites will vote for mr obama because they want to think they helped make history 
the media which has its own grim reasons for supporting mr obama is mesmerized by the same prospect editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like history is made the day after the election and some will lose all selfcontrol and add an exclamation mark the emphasis of course will be on mr obama as the first black president implying more to come the media which always subtly boost the democrat will be even more blatantly partisan this time downplaying every blunder mr obama makes and highlighting mr mccains 
fifth many whites will vote for mr obamaor at least not vote for mr mccainbecause the republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years old and pockmarked mr mccain is thoroughly disliked in the senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes he has dismayed republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals and dismayed everyone else by saying america should stay in iraq for  years if it takes that long to win mr obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even republicans like 
mr obama will also crush mr mccain in facetoface debates mr mccain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than george w bush can and will come across as a thickwitted geezer mr obama who is as glib as any politician gives credence to hl menckens definition of democracy as rule by orators 
but what about americas storied racism isnt america brimming with people who cant bear the thought of a black president americans have been numbed for decades by attractive televisionblacks who read the news forecast the weather and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy americans get a steady diet of heroic movieblacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes solve baffling technical problems dispense sage advice and save the world even the current miss usa is black there are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state the march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldnt even if they could 
the final reason why whites will vote for mr obama is that the republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work if they were serious they would fill the airways with jeremiah wright prancing and raving along with the message this is the man who married mr and mrs obama baptized their children and whom mr obama calls a family member they would buy radio ads quoting michelle obamas thesis in which she says she will always be black first and american second mr mccain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this 
many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse  percent think mr obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician and many say they would have warned him not to run for fear he would be killed an assassination would certainly be a shattering event there is no telling how many cities would go up in flames and thirdworld countries which have followed the obama nomination with unprecedented interest would help make it the most widely reported killing in history i have just returned from a muslim country in which everyone has heard of mr obama and likes him but most have never heard of john mccain whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning however assassination has gone out of style in america and white resistancesuch as it isis dependably nonviolent mr obama will be perfectly safe 
in any case mr obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black whites who dont want a black president would not vote for a democrat anyway as for black voters even nominal republicans are said to be running for the doors but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks not so for whites of course just try telling your coworkers that you disagree with mr mccain but are voting for him because he is white 
racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in november even if mr mccains policies are worse than mr obamas should they vote for the white manone with an adopted bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads a black in the white house is a powerful symbol of white dispossession a mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation this is bitter medicine 
some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of racism whites are forever facing but they are dreaming the entire government could look like a meeting of the mystic knights of the sea but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man i suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate 
aside from the symbolic impact which cannot be calculated will president obama be much different from a president hillary clinton she would lard her cabinet with blacks and hispanics nominate ultraliberal judges push for amnesty grovel before nonwhites everywhere and load up the civil rights division of the justice department with antiwhite sharks she would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over hispanics and asians see  turning up the pressure  ar may  our choice therefore could not be more disagreeable on balance we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle deluded white people giving their country away or cleareyed blacks helping themselves to it 
president obama will however face special pressures he cant let the pushier brothers walk all over him but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back it will be a tricky balance mr obamas first annual address to the naacp will be a love feast but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment poverty and incarceration rates havent changed at all 
even mr obamas starstruck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that change he promised there is not going to be change the system is far too stuck in its selfserving ways for that with the help of an enlarged democratic majority in congress mr obama may set up some wheezing byzantine form of socialized medicine but no one will be happy with it if mr obama inherits a sick economy a weak dollar expensive oil and shrinking revenues americans will not at all like the change they get 
on the bright side with mr obama we have a good chance of piquant firstlady behavior what will the white house be like with michelle in charge will she want a new exterior paint job how and whom will she entertain will the big mans guest bedroomsin the african traditionbe turned over to third cousins from kenya and the south side of chicago there is no telling with what improprieties large and small mrs obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an american 
it will be an edifying presidency and whites may be a little less deluded in ",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,river ran red,obama win jared taylor

the first time dianna barindelli carried a baby that wasnt her own was in  we were done having kids but i still wanted to be pregnant says the modesto calif stayathome mom whose own daughters are  and  barindelli signed up with the center for surrogate parenting in encino one of the most exclusive surrogacy agencies in the world in  she matched with a chinese couple unlike many agencies csp first shows parent applications to the surrogates rather than the other way around its little things that youll connect with people over says barindelli who was attracted to pictures of the couples extended travels and their traditional wedding photos 
the embryo transfer took place in late  barindelli emailed the mom weekly sending updates and ultrasound pictures with wechat an app that offers instantaneous translation the intended parents ips planned to be there for the birth but the baby boy arrived two weeks early  hours before they arrived says barindelli i texted and made sure the mom was ok with him staying in my room i cleared everything with her i didnt want her to feel bad that she wasnt there 
barindelli who used her surrogacy fees to set up a college fund for her girls is pregnant again this time with the baby due feb  of a taiwanese couple she may not be done her first chinese couple emailed her recently soon after their sons first birthday they still have frozen embryos and hope that barindelli now  will carry their second child 
commercial surrogacy is banned in most parts of the world as well as in many us states until recently infertile couples singles and gay wouldbe dads had a handful of options to turn to when it came to finding a surrogate among them india thailand nepal and mexico where surrogacy services have cost a quarter of the  to  bill typical in the us but in the past few years those countries have started enforcing laws banning international surrogacy meanwhile chinathe worlds most populous country with a growing wealthy elite and where some doctors believe infertility is more common than in the uslifted its decadeslong onechild policy the result is a soaring chinese demand for us surrogacy services one that is flourishing particularly in california with its culturally friendly enclaves excellent physicians and favorable state laws that regard ips as a babys legal parents even before birth if proper court documents are filed snip

snip 
most local agencies have a mix of caucasian latina and africanamerican surrogates i cant think of a time when weve had an asian surrogate says growing generations bergman multiple agency heads say chinese ips tend to strongly prefer a caucasian surrogate people really have this fantasy because of a lot of the marketing that was done in china says gifted journeys wilsonmiller they have this picture of blond surrogates who look like movie stars carrying the baby with their traditional families snip 
the concept of crossrace surrogacy can confound friends family and associates of surrogates and ips alike in august comedian glozell green who is africanamerican and her husband also africanamerican had a baby girl via a surrogate our surrogate is a blueeyed blonde the youtube star told potential ips gathered in a culver city hotel in early october people in her life kept asking if the baby was going to be white 
surrogate selection aside california has the added allure of numerous enclaves where families can be surrounded by chinese speakers and businesses people from china can stay in irvine for example and they have chinese tv on their cable packages throughout california there are places they can go and shop and find stuff in chinese if they go to kansas or oklahoma its total culture shock says expect miracles anderson snip 
of course any baby born via surrogate in the us has birthright citizenship the chinese couples really like that because a lot of them want to come back and forth says molly obrien a fertility lawyer with offices in torrance who frequently travels to china to participate in information sessions for wouldbe parents often sponsored by doctors offices or assistedreproduction agencies maybe they eventually want that child to be able to go to college here unlike the us china forbids dual citizenship and most americanborn chinese babies remain us citizens most chinese couples just keep that american passport its only if you want to use the government services that youve got to be chinese says csps synesiou

Henry Wolff,2016-11-08T05:20:38.559+02:00,california set to let public schools teach primarily in spanish,"new las vegas casino only for chinese gamblers  
los angeles times 
casino operators know there are no gamblers quite like the chinese 
with their affinity for baccarat the most lucrative game in las vegas chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment  be it with private chinese gaming salons lunar new year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from hong kong and taiwan 
no one in las vegas however has built a casino and hotel strictly for chinese visitors until now 
the lucky dragon hotel  casino is billing itself as las vegas first asianthemed resort funded in large part by chinese investors the property set to open dec  with a traditional lion dance will offer bilingual staff and signage a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldnt look or taste out of place in guangzhou or shanghai 
no general tsos or egg rolls here said david jacoby chief operating officer for the resort which left no chinese superstition unturned 
the rosecolored resorts front entrance is designed in a dragon motif a feng shui master blessed its kitchens the main bar is eightsided for good fortune and its hard to find a no  on the property the unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory the ninestory hotel even skips a fourth floor 
this place is heavily feng shuied jacoby said 
with all that attention to detail youd think lucky dragons brain trust was born in beijing but the idea behind the room boutique resort off the northern end of the las vegas strip was largely conceived by an american veteran gaming executive bill weidner the former president and chief operating officer of las vegas sands corp 
weidner an advisor to lucky dragon is no neophyte to the chinese market he worked with some of chinas most powerful government figures to lead sands expansion into macau when the former portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in  macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the las vegas strip forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry 
weidner was also involved in the development of the billion marina bay sands in singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in  
weidner and jacoby know major las vegas gaming resorts like the sands venetian mgm or wynn already cater to chinas high rollers with vip parlors and relationships forged in macau 
lucky dragon though tiny compared with those properties addresses what they see as a gap in the market middleclass chinese gamblers chinese americans as well as the broader asian american community 
let them fight over the  and let us fight over the remaining  said jacoby who previously worked for weidners firm global gaming asset management opening a casino resort in the philippines 
that pool of chinese gamers will almost certainly grow on dec  hainan airlines will fly the first direct flights from china to las vegass mccarran international airport lucky dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight jacoby said 
already a record  visitors from china traveled to las vegas last year nearly double the number in  according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority 
meanwhile ground was broken on another asianthemed resort this one much bigger than lucky dragon resorts world a malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of asian gaming experience is spending up to  billion for a room property on the north strip that will feature chinese architecture such as an ersatz great wall its slated to open in  
plans are also underway to build a billion resort on the strip called alon las vegas the project is owned by australias crown resort who count chinese gamers as a major source of business 
its going to be even more of a competitive market said john decree an analyst at union gaming in las vegas everyones coming for the same customer its going to be a challenge with  rooms the hotel is small compared with many on the strip but with five restaurants it offers more dining options than many its size isaac brekken  for the times 
competition could also be fierce for chinese high rollers whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing chinese economy and an anticorruption campaign at home that until recently sent macau gambling revenues into a twoyear slump 
las vegas isnt immune to those headwinds after years of explosive growth casinos on the strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about  billion in  thats nearly  billion less than  according to the nevada gaming control board 
the casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture thats both for practical and superstitious reasons baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games and as a game of chance over skill baccarat also plays into chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck 
the vast majority of baccarat play comes from the asian market said jacoby of lucky dragon 
jacobys casino will offer seven vip baccarat tables on a secondfloor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic chinese food in addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world the property will serve staples like congee wonton noodles and dim sum 
food is expected to be a big draw because chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others 
las vegas has a number of wellregarded chinese restaurants such as ping pang pong at gold coast hotel  casino china mama in chinatown and an outpost of chengdu taste the san gabriel valley stalwart for sichuan cuisine highend chinese food is also served at highroller rooms such as the venetians paiza club 
no casino however boasts the concentration of chinese restaurants that lucky dragon will with five altogether the hope is chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat  and gamble  at lucky dragon when they venture off the strip 
the emphasis on food means lucky dragons owners can eschew things that arent particularly important to chinese tourists like a whiskey bar or nightclub and because chinese tourists often dont like to sunbathe lucky dragons pool isnt much bigger than the backyard variety 
jacoby says his competitors on the strip offer chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of chinese restaurants and parlors in megacasinos that have to serve all manner of people not just chinese by comparison visitors to lucky dragon can start conversing in mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in he said 
were trying to take the asian gaming experience and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building jacoby said 
though lucky dragon will rely heavily on asian american customers at first its funding was largely drawn from mainland chinese investors through the federal eb visa program the visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent us residency in exchange for a minimum investment of  that also creates american jobs rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs the casino is prioritizing dining options that includes a tea room still under construction isaac brekken  for the times 
chinese investors have dominated the program nationwide accounting for  of applicants awaiting eb visas though occasionally subject to fraud the program has successfully funded a handful of mixedused projects in new york the jw marriott hotel at la live and the sls hotel  casino across from lucky dragon 
jacoby declined to say how many chinese investors are involved in lucky dragon which is expected to employ  people jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about  million were inaccurate 
the company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city but financial commitments from weidners family and others put the project back on track 
lucky dragon isnt the first las vegas resort to target a specific demographic the hard rock hotel  casino and the palms casino resort opened years ago catering to young partygoers and clubbers before eventually being overshadowed by larger competitors on the strip such as the mgm grand and the cosmopolitan 
lucky dragons early backers even considered building an lgbt resort before settling on their current strategy one they say will live and die on being able to deliver an authentic chinese gambling experience

Henry Wolff,2016-11-08T05:20:41.889+02:00,why american surrogates are in demand for chinese families,"world wildlife falls by  in  years  
bbc news global wildlife populations have fallen by  since  a report says 
the living planet assessment by the zoological society of london zsl and wwf suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates by  
the figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses 
human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines 
dr mike barrett head of science and policy at wwf said its pretty clear under business as usual we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations but i think now weve reached a point where there isnt really any excuse to let this carry on 
we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations  it really is now down to us to act 
however the methodology of the report has been criticised image copyright carlos drews  wwf image caption the report looked at data collected on  species of vertebrates over the last  years 
the living planet report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worlds wildlife 
for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  dr mike barrett wwf 
this analysis looked at  different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles  about  of the total number of vertebrate species in the world 
the team collected data from peerreviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and ngos 
any species with population data going back to  with two or more time points to show trends was included in the study 
the researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time 
some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data there are many records on arctic and near arctic birds for example or very little data tropical amphibians for example the report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture 
the last report published in  estimated that the worlds wildlife populations had halved over the last  years 
this assessment suggests that the trend has continued since  populations have declined by an average of  
dr barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others 
we do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment  for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  this is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example 
it also highlighted other species such as african elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing 
if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse dr robin freeman zsl 
the researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of  each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by  below  levels by the end of the decade 
dr robin freeman head of zsls indicators  assessments unit said but thats assuming things continue as we expect if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse 
but one of the things i think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations  they are not extinctions by and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it image copyright scott dickerson image caption there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worlds vertebrates 
however living planet reports have drawn some criticisms 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy stuart pimm duke university 
stuart pimm professor of conservation ecology at duke university in the united states said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy he told bbc news 
for example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western europe 
when you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier there is almost nothing from south america from tropical africa there is not much from the tropics period any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean 
theyre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number its flawed 
but dr freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world 
its completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data but thats because there is a lack of data 
were confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline 
its entirely possible that species that arent being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse  but id be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed",english,amren.com,http://www.amren.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AmRen.jpg,bs,american surrogates demand chinese families,world wildlife falls years bbc news global wildlife populations fallen since report says living planet assessment zoological society london zsl wwf suggests trend continues decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates figures suggest animals living lakes rivers wetlands suffering biggest losses human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution climate change contributed declines dr mike barrett head science policy wwf said pretty clear business usual see continued declines wildlife populations think weve reached point isnt really excuse let carry know causes know scale impact humans nature wildlife populations really us act however methodology report criticised image copyright carlos drews wwf image caption report looked data collected species vertebrates last years living planet report published every two years aims provide assessment state worlds wildlife freshwater species alone decline stands since dr mike barrett wwf analysis looked different species birds fish mammals amphibians reptiles total number vertebrate species world team collected data peerreviewed studies government statistics surveys collated conservation groups ngos species population data going back two time points show trends included study researchers analysed population sizes changed time information weighted take account groups animals great deal data many records arctic near arctic birds example little data tropical amphibians example report authors said make sure surplus information declines animals skew overall picture last report published estimated worlds wildlife populations halved last years assessment suggests trend continued since populations declined average dr barrett said groups animals fared worse others see particularly strong declines freshwater environment freshwater species alone decline stands since related way water used taken fresh water systems also fragmentation freshwater systems dam building example also highlighted species african elephants suffered huge declines recent years increase poaching sharks threatened overfishing pressures overexploitation illegal wildlife trade example increase worsen trend may worse dr robin freeman zsl researchers conclude vertebrate populations declining average year warn nothing done wildlife populations could fall levels end decade dr robin freeman head zsls indicators assessments unit said thats assuming things continue expect pressures overexploitation illegal wildlife trade example increase worsen trend may worse one things think important stats trends declines number animals wildlife populations extinctions large vanishing presents us opportunity something image copyright scott dickerson image caption still many gaps knowledge worlds vertebrates however living planet reports drawn criticisms numbers report sensible numbers sketchy stuart pimm duke university stuart pimm professor conservation ecology duke university united states said wildlife decline many gaps data boil population loss single figure numbers report sensible numbers sketchy told bbc news example look data comes surprisingly massively skewed towards western europe go elsewhere data become far fewer practice become much much sketchier almost nothing south america tropical africa much tropics period time trying mix stuff like hard know numbers mean theyre trying pull stuff blender spew single number flawed dr freeman said team taken best data possible around world completely true regions groups like tropical amphibians example lack data thats lack data confident method using best method present overall estimate population decline entirely possible species arent monitored effectively may much worse id surprised much better observed,1,,,,,

without you even saying a word this kind of technology sounds like science fiction but there are a variety of ways scientists are edging towards making it a reality according to a new review computers that can read our minds might enhance the capabilities of already existing speech interfaces with devices like siri and ok google but it could be even more important for those with speech difficulties

scientists are already decoding speech from signals generated in our brains when we speak or listen to someone talking in the new study mr herff and coauthor dr tanja schultz both from the karlsruhe institute of technology compared the pros and cons of using various brain imaging techniques to take neural signals from the brain and decode them to text there are a variety of technologies out there the authors said including functional mri and near infrared imaging that detect neural signals based on the metabolic activity of neurons another method can detect electromagnetic activity of neurons responding to speech but there was one method in particular called electrocorticography which stood out in the new review the authors said this technique uses a braintotext system demonstrated on epilepsy patients who already had electrode grids implanted for treatment of their condition the patients read out texts presented on a screen in front of them while their brain activity was recorded this formed the basis of a database of patterns of neural signals that could now be matched to speech elements or phones when the researchers included language and dictionary models in their algorithms they were able to decode neural signals to text with a high degree of accuracy there are a variety of technologies out there the authors said including functional mri stock image pictured

method to convict criminals or as a remote lie detector test for the first time we could show that brain activity can be decoded specifically enough to use asr automated speech recognition technology on brain signals said mr herff however the current need for implanted electrodes renders it far from usable in daytoday life to go from here to a functioning thoughtdetection device will still require

the threats to the streaming tv company might not be amazon or other streaming services but instead pharmacological ways of entertaining people reed hastings has said 
and just as films and tv shows are a supposedly improved version of other entertainments those same things might eventually become defunct he said in the same way that the cinema and tv screen made the opera and the novel much smaller something else might be on the way to do the same thing the netflix boss said at a wall street journal event 
those challenges could come from anywhere he said they might not be another form of screen is it vr is it gaming is it pharmacological mr hastings asked the event

in twenty or fifty years taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable mr hastings said and if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological well be in real trouble 
his references to the matrix  and to being in trouble  recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including elon musk and sam altman both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe  something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world but could just as easily be the result of a druginduced hallucination

all gov 
the controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat 
but an extensive examination by the new york times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem  genetic modification in the united states and canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides 
the promise of genetic modification was twofold by making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the worlds growing population while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides 
twenty years ago europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the united states and canada were embracing it comparing results on the two continents using independent data as well as academic and industry research shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise 
an analysis by the times using un data showed that the united states and canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against western europe a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like france and germany  also a recent national academy of sciences report found there was little evidence that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the united states had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops 
at the same time herbicide use has increased in the united states even as major crops like corn soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties and the united states has fallen behind europes biggest producer france in reducing the overall use of pesticides which includes both herbicides and insecticides 
one measure contained in data from the us geological survey  shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides since gm crops were introduced in the united states two decades ago for crops like corn cotton and soybeans the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third but the spraying of herbicides which are used in much higher volumes has risen  percent 
by contrast in france use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen  percent and herbicide use has decreased  percent

daily caller 
the fbi on tuesday released documents related to a nowclosed federal investigation of an alleged paytoplay scheme involving bill clinton and the clinton foundation 
the documents which are heavily redacted regard the investigation of clintons lastminute pardon of marc rich a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the us for tax evasion 
the jan   pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandalplagued clinton administration richs exwife denise donated more than  million to various clinton and democratic entities including the democratic national committee hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation 
the release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized but the dump is noteworthy for two reasons it reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning paytoplay allegations the clinton foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple fbi field offices 
it also comes as the fbi is locked in a bitter standoff with the clinton foundation and the justice department over fbi director james comeys handling of the hillary clinton email investigation 
the newlyreleased files include one entry which shows that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed prior to the rich pardon 
roger adams the us pardon attorney at the time testified to congress in feb  that none of the regular procedures were followed ahead of the rich reprieve 
former attorney general eric holder is also mentioned in the file it cites holders testimony that he was the only person who worked at doj  he was deputy attorney general at the time  about the rich pardon from the fbis clinton foundation investigation files 
a grand jury was convened to weigh the merits of the case but no indictments were handed down ironically the law enforcement official who closed the case was fbi director comey he served as deputy attorney general in the george w bush administration 
the fbis website suggests that more clinton foundation investigation records could be coming in the future 
this initial release consists of material from the fbis files related to the william j clinton foundation  a nonprofit c organization the site reads the bulk of these records come from a  fbi investigation into the pardon of marc rich  aka marcell david reich by president clinton in  it was closed in  
the fbi did not respond to a request for more information on future releases

this article was written by jay syrmopoulos and originally published at the free thought project  
editors comment he who holds the gold makes the rules fresh attempts at containing russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves russia appears to be building strength in every way putin and his country have no intention of being under the american thumb and are developing rapid resistance as the us petrodollar loses its grip and china russia and the east shift into new currencies and shifting world order 
what lies ahead it will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets and china and russia have positioned themselves very well prepare for a changing economic landscape and one in which selfreliance might be all we have 
russia is hoarding gold at an alarming rate  the next world war will be fought with currencies 
by jay syrmopoulos 
with all eyes on russias unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile icbm which nato has dubbed the satan missile  as tensions with the us increase moscows most potent weapon may be something drastically different 
the rapidly evolving geopolitical weapon brandished by russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold as well as russias native currency the ruble 
take a look at the symbol below as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order  potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift  and much sooner than you might think 
image httpthefreethoughtprojectcomwpcontentuploadsbankofrussiaepng 
the symbol is the new designation of the russian ruble russias national currency 
similar to how the us uses the dollar sign  the uk uses the pound sign  and the european union uses the euro symbol  russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally 
after the failed reset in usrussian relations by the obama administration and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship washington began targeting entire sectors of the russian economy as well as specific individuals meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force moscow into compliance 
instead of decimating russia what it precipitated was a russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the us petrodollar and working with china to create an alternative to the swift payment system that isnt solely controlled by western interests see asian infrastructure investment bank  new development bank 
according to the corbett report  
new reports indicate that china is ready to launch its swift alternative and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of dedollarization that is seeing the bricsled resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the usled washington consensus 
for those who dont know swift stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and is shorthand for the swiftnet network that is used by over  financial institutions in  countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world swift does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions still given the systems near universality in the financial system it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the swift network 
this is why delisting from the swift network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the us and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns 
recently financial guru jim rickards author of the book currency wars wrote that russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy russian bonds and stocks and the russian currency the ruble will all benefit rickards believes a strong turnaround is coming within russia and that this comeback will benefit the ruble 
while still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the us russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar there remains a clear and present danger of the russian economy being devastated by the whims of washington 
the bank of russia that nations central bank is extremely clear about its mission and monetary policy declaring on its website 
monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing wellbeing of russian citizens the bank of russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflationtargeting regime and sees price stability albeit sustainably low inflation as its priority given structural peculiarities of the russian economy the target is to reduce inflation to  by  and maintain it within that range in the medium run 
in laymans terms that means that monetary policy similar to nuclear weapons and the military are an integral part of the state policy in russia while many analysts have noted the increased buildup in russias military arsenal seemingly few have highlighted the massive buildup of russian gold reserves over the past decade 
below is a chart showing russian gold reserves between  and last year  
since  there has been a yearonyear increase that reveals a significant upward trend the chart clearly reveals that russias state policy of increasing state monetary assets in the form of gold additionally the russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets from  to  russias state holdings of gold tripled 
within just the past year russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
according to the business insider  
in july of this year the central bank of russia added  ounces of gold to its reserves the onemonth uptick in russian gold reserves   ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick golds turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada 
at that same rate   ounces per month  in a mere five months russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of barricks massive goldstrike mine in nevada 
currently russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world its clear that there is a concerted effort by russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the united states 
rickards in his  book currency wars theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserves to form a global goldbacked currency to compete against the us dollar currently russian reserves stand at roughly  tonnes with chinese reserves totaling over  tonnes according to china  its likely more which would amount to a combined total of roughly  tonnes of gold 
the us is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf thus the us lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to business insider 
imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that russianchinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imfs gold reserve of over  tonnes russian chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly  tonnes and would allow for direct competition with the us gold reserves estimated at  tonnes 
russia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a wellarmed state and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm 
the reality is that the united states is  trillion dollars in debt and eventually the time will come when the us economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on hard assets such as gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the us using the petrodollar as a weapon 
ultimately the united states russia and china are all controlled by centralized powerhungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the imf the world bank swift new development bank and the asian infrastructure investment bank 
its not russian nuclear weapons that people should fear as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a firststrike nuclear attack the true threat to america is our economic house of cards built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that of people

activist post 
while debate surrounds the threat of autonomous killer robots the mechanized replacement of humans continues across the workforce 
the industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown as you can see in the graphic below  sales surged  over a previous record year to reach almost  million units 
there are many factors driving this growth which you can read about here but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the us and china with china leading the way 
the nature of robotics is also changing as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses one key area of course is security robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons  care facilities  and schools in various locations around the world 
one us robot company gamma  robotics has designed several models for mass production their latest  ramsee  can be seen in the video below a true mass rollout of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the  million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol 
ramsee advertises the following capabilities is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision provides realtime data intruders motion heat fire smoke gases  more is a humanmachine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier 
significantly gamma  robotics has partnered with hexagon safety  infrastructure the global leader in public safety and security solutions 
however ramsee is missing one thing weapons for that we have to travel to china where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle 
in late  i covered an announcement from chinas xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of  weaponized antiterrorism robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol 
the toysized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield said the report following their unveiling at the  world robot conference in beijing 
the first model is known as a reconnaissance robot which scouts for poisonous gases dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to baseif this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger the second robot model  a small explosive ordnance disposal eod machine  would be sent in to diffuse it 
but with other more complicated threats an attacker robot would start its mission armed with minorcaliber weapons recoilless rifles and grenade launchers 
with a sighting telescope a trigger and a safe installed the attacker can hit its target from a long distance xinhua said 
the local police force in beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots  which are priced at  million yuan  for the set by manufacturers hit robot group who are based in the northern city of harbin 
apart from antiterror operations they can also be applied in fire fighting public security forestry and agriculture the companys sales manager chen deqiang said according to xinhua 
if we have learned anything about antiterrorism efforts authorities consider frontline deployment to be areas of public travel we were given the tsa based on such notions and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports and soontobe at other public transportation if authorities have their way 
china has gone to the next level with a robot tsa of sorts called anbot that is equipped with what is essentially a taserlike device that is being fittingly compared to a cattleprod 
image credit 
it was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression for now its first job is to patrol chinas shenzhen airport 
most alarming however is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet 
the back end of this intelligent security robot is l inked to chinas tianhe supercomputer  where it has access to cloud services  anbot conducts patrols recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition 
these cloud services give the robots petascale processing power  well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot the supercomputer connection is there to enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and humanmachine interface of these devices said the uschina economic and security review in a report released tuesday that examines chinas autonomous systems development efforts  emphasis added 
 source  
this link to cloud services is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the wikipedia for robots  essentially an internet cloud brain through robottorobot information sharing they can speed up their learning process  autonomously examples have included robots that can learn to cook and robots that can learn the tasks involved in caregiving however when applied to policing things become much more ethically troubling 
people were outraged in the us for example when a robot in dallas was used to deliver a pound of c explosive to a us citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution at least in that case a human made the decision but it is being viewed as a tiptoe along the path to the widespread use of killer robots much as we have seen with the use of drones discussion was once limited to overseas  egregious enough  but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones 
as john vibes wrote  it might be inevitable 
the taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun according to a recent report by the wall street journal 
not only will the drones be equipped with tasers but there is also talk of them being autonomous meaning that an actual human wont necessarily be needed to fly the drone 
this is actually already being done in india  the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with nonlethal weapons and just this week british tabloid the sun  had a feature entitled vladimir putins russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies deputy pm dmitry rogozin admits given the available facts this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational 
clearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police but is that the trend we are actually seeing or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industriallevel suppression and killing

Alex Ansary,2016-11-02T18:36:20.532+02:00,russias most potent weapon hoarding gold,"wikileaks documents reveal united nations interest in ufos  
huffington post 
revelations in a set of hacked emails released by wikileaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about ufos and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting earth but a very significant  and possibly overlooked  group of wikileaks items relevant to the topic was released on may   
wikileaks posted more than half a million us state department diplomatic documents from  detailing americas interactions with countries all around the world  including grenada prime minister eric gairys efforts to organize a united nationsbased committee to research and investigate global ufo reports 
many of the documents written by american un officials indicated how closely they were monitoring grenadas uforelated activities 
one document  from nov   revealed my involvement in helping grenada to produce a credible ufo presentation 
i had an opportunity in early  to meet gairy in new york to present an idea about how i thought the un would pay attention to his ufo crusade through his ambassadors i gave him a copy of a documentary record album ufos the credibility factor that i produced for cbs inc in  
gairy and i met and after i convinced him i could bring a very credible group of speakers to the un he agreed to sponsor my proposal see image below shortly after a handshake deal he made me a temporary delegateadviser of grenada and the rest was well history courtesy of lee speigel this  letter from grenada to lee speigel confirmed that countrys commitment to sponsor speigels ufo presentation at the united nations 
the following image shows part of the group i brought together in july  to meet with un secretarygeneral kurt waldheim he wanted to know what we were planning to do at our november event in front of the special political committee which included representatives from the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space courtesy of lee speigel on july   producer lee speigel now a huffington post writer brought together a group of military scientific and psychological experts to meet with united nations secretarygeneral kurt waldheim to discuss speigels upcoming presentation to the un special political committee later that year topic the importance of establishing an international ufo committee pictured from left usaf astronaut col gordon cooper astronomer jacques vallee astronomerastrophysicist claude poher astronomer j allen hynek grenada prime minister sir eric gairy waldheim morton gleisner of the special political committee lee speigel researcher leonard stringfield and university of colorado psychologist david saunders 
another cable posted on wikileaks  from nov   refers to ambassador richard petrees meeting with grenada representatives to discuss their ufo resolution ambassador petree acknowledged the high level of interest in ufos among some elements of the private sector and scientific community  and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the us and other countries 
on nov   the day after our presentation at the un this document was sent through official channels detailing the actual ufo event describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations 
a few days after that on dec   a followup cable was transmitted including the following 
subsequent to the introduction of the grenadian ufo resolution misoff mission officer has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions which included representation from austria ussr and grenada in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem 
a draft decision to be taken by the special political committee spc has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations subject to concurrence of their respective capitals we think referral of the ufo matter to the outer space committee osc without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken provides the flexibility the osc needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate 
it will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution and gamble on the results 
the following week brought forth another document  on dec   which stated 
the general assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life including unidentified flying objects and to inform the secretarygeneral of the observations research and evaluation of such activities 
it was further suggested that grenadas views on ufos could be discussed in  unfortunately that didnt come to pass as grenada prime minister gairy was overthrown in a  coup 
needless to say without the gairybased initiative on ufos it was quietly relegated to grenadas back burner 
this is the tip of the ufoun iceberg it shows how the subject of ufos wasnt merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside there was and perhaps still is some interest there just waiting to emerge",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/clip_image001_thumb2.jpg,bs,russias potent weapon hoarding gold,wikileaks documents reveal united nations interest ufos huffington post revelations set hacked emails released wikileaks earlier month sparked new conversations ufos speculation extraterrestrials visiting earth significant possibly overlooked group wikileaks items relevant topic released may wikileaks posted half million us state department diplomatic documents detailing americas interactions countries around world including grenada prime minister eric gairys efforts organize united nationsbased committee research investigate global ufo reports many documents written american un officials indicated closely monitoring grenadas uforelated activities one document nov revealed involvement helping grenada produce credible ufo presentation opportunity early meet gairy new york present idea thought un would pay attention ufo crusade ambassadors gave copy documentary record album ufos credibility factor produced cbs inc gairy met convinced could bring credible group speakers un agreed sponsor proposal see image shortly handshake deal made temporary delegateadviser grenada rest well history courtesy lee speigel letter grenada lee speigel confirmed countrys commitment sponsor speigels ufo presentation united nations following image shows part group brought together july meet un secretarygeneral kurt waldheim wanted know planning november event front special political committee included representatives committee peaceful uses outer space courtesy lee speigel july producer lee speigel huffington post writer brought together group military scientific psychological experts meet united nations secretarygeneral kurt waldheim discuss speigels upcoming presentation un special political committee later year topic importance establishing international ufo committee pictured left usaf astronaut col gordon cooper astronomer jacques vallee astronomerastrophysicist claude poher astronomer j allen hynek grenada prime minister sir eric gairy waldheim morton gleisner special political committee lee speigel researcher leonard stringfield university colorado psychologist david saunders another cable posted wikileaks nov refers ambassador richard petrees meeting grenada representatives discuss ufo resolution ambassador petree acknowledged high level interest ufos among elements private sector scientific community pointed budgetary impact major concern us countries nov day presentation un document sent official channels detailing actual ufo event describing invited scientific military speakers say member nations days dec followup cable transmitted including following subsequent introduction grenadian ufo resolution misoff mission officer engaged two separate informal negotiating sessions included representation austria ussr grenada attempt arrive mutually acceptable compromise solution problem draft decision taken special political committee spc agreed upon participants informal negotiations subject concurrence respective capitals think referral ufo matter outer space committee osc without preordained mandate action taken provides flexibility osc needs take whatever action deems appropriate also obviate need vote resolution gamble results following week brought forth another document dec stated general assembly invites interested member states take appropriate steps coordinate national level scientific research investigation extraterrestrial life including unidentified flying objects inform secretarygeneral observations research evaluation activities suggested grenadas views ufos could discussed unfortunately didnt come pass grenada prime minister gairy overthrown coup needless say without gairybased initiative ufos quietly relegated grenadas back burner tip ufoun iceberg shows subject ufos wasnt merely officially ridiculed slapped aside perhaps still interest waiting emerge,1,,,,,
Alex Ansary,2016-11-02T18:36:20.940+02:00,china airport security robot gives electroshocks,"suspect captured in ambushstyle killings of two iowa cops  
usa today 
authorities captured a yearold male suspect without incident wednesday hours after an earlymorning ambushstyle killing of two police officers in the des moines metro area 
the suspect in the backtoback killings was identified as scott michael greene said urbandale police spokesman sgt chad underwood before capturing him police had described greene who was last seen driving a blue ford f with an iowa license plate as armed and dangerous 
greene was taken into custody by the dallas county sheriffs department while walking along a rural road in redfield about  miles west of where the shootings occurred 
according to police greene flagged down a passing department of natural resources officer handed over his id and told the officer to call police no shots were fired and there was no struggle according to police 
the suspect was taken by ambulance to a des moines hospital with an unknown injury 
in a late morning news conference police identified the slain officers as urbandale police officer justin martin and des moines police sgt anthony tony beminio 
the attacks began around  am ct when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of th street and aurora avenue in urbandale 
the first officers arriving on the scene found martin fatally wounded about  minutes later some two miles away beminio was was shot near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan ave while responding to reports of the first officers shooting beminio was transported to iowa methodist medical center where he died scott michael greene photo des moines police 
both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars 
it doesnt look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars a visibly emotional parizek told reporters 
in all appearances it looks  that these officers were ambushed he added officer from des moines and another from urbandale were shot and killed in their cars dmpolice said officersdown 
 daniel p finney newsmanone november   
des moines police fearing officers were being singled out paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone parizek said 
theres literally a clear and present danger if youre a police officer he said 
police did not offer many details on how investigators identified greene as a suspect underwood said he was identified through a series of leads and a series of investigative tips 
as of an earlymorning news conference police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers names years of service and other details until later in the day parizek said 
attorney general loretta lynch condemned the killings saying violence has no place in the united states of america 
let me be clear there is no message in murder the attorney general said referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country violence creates nothing it only destroys a des moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan avenue in des moines on wednesday nov   photo brian powers the des moines register 
its the first time des moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in  
two des moines officers susan farrell and carlos puentemorales died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck headon by a wrongway drunk driver 
the killing of the urbandale officer appeared to be the citys first for an officer shot in the line of duty underwood said at the news conference 
parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost farrell and puentemorales as well as with this tragedy 
i dont even know where to begin on how bad this year is he said but this is what we do we come in day in and day out we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of whats going on in our personal and professional lives officers investigate the scene at merle hay and sheridan ave where an officer was found shot at about  am on on wednesday nov   in urbandale 
in a statement iowa gov terry branstad called the attack on the officers an attack on the public safety of all iowans 
we call on iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice he said our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harms way 
iowa sen joni ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed 
although the investigation is still unfolding what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us ernst said this was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated

clinton specifically referred to the civil war suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from donald trump 
abraham lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges  the challenge posed by slavery  and we fought a civil war she said 
she warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously 
but we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together she added failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided america by race class and gender 
she also claimed that trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin 
i know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering but i dont think so she said at a rally in kent ohio earlier in the day 
a post at barracuda brigade observed 
liberals especially the clinton are always projecting anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing she suggests that her message is one of hope and change when in fact it is just more of the same 
moreover trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while clinton  co have done absolutely nothing but engage in fearmongering and fingerpointing 
still we have to ask  was clintons hint a warning or a threat

reuters 
down a georgia country road camouflaged members of the three percent security force have mobilized for rifle practice handtohand combat training  and an impromptu campaign rally for republican presidential candidate donald trump 
how many people are voting for trump oohrah asks chris hill a paralegal who goes by the code name bloodagent 
oohrah shout a dozen militia members in response as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend 
as the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on nov  and civil unrest in the days following a victory by democrat hillary clinton 
they say they wont fire the first shot but theyre not planning to leave their guns at home either 
trumps populist campaign has energized militia members like hill who admire the republican moguls promise to deport illegal immigrants stop muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the mexico border trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be rigged and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win at least one paramilitary group the oath keepers has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud 
armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early s fueled by confrontations in ruby ridge idaho and waco texas culminating in a militia sympathizers  bombing of a federal office building in oklahoma city that killed  people 
their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years driven by fears that president barack obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government the southern poverty law center which tracks extremist groups estimates there were  active militias last year up from  in  
in recent years armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of landuse disputes in the western united states federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in oregon 
many fear clinton would push the county further to the left 
this is the last chance to save america from ruin hill said im surprised i was able to survive or suffer through eight years of obama without literally going insane but hillary is going to be more of the same 

extremist groups emboldened 
the oath keepers a prominent antigovernment force that sent guntoting members to the  race riots in ferguson missouri called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud 
an hour south of atlanta the three percent security force started the day around the campfire taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range they whooped with approval when blasts from one members highpowered rifle knocked down a tree 
the group operates independently but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government the movement draws its name from the notion that no more than  percent of the american population fought in the revolutionary war against britain 
amid the war games hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on washington if clinton wins 
he said he doesnt want his members leading the way but they will defend the protesters if need be his group will not hesitate to act if a president clinton tries to disarm gun owners he said 
i will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen and prevent them from being disarmed and i will fight and i will kill and i may die in the process said hill who founded the militia several years ago 
trumps candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law said ryan lenz a researcher at the southern poverty law center 
prior to this campaign season these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the american political landscape he said now these ideas are legitimized 
over the past week some prominent trump supporters have hinted at violence 
if trump loses im grabbing my musket former illinois representative joe walsh wrote on twitter last week conservative commentator wayne root fantasized about clintons death while speaking at a trump rally in las vegas on sunday 
back in georgia the three percent security force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun they then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides ready for whatever may come

according to the final preelection new york timescbs news poll released on thursday an overwhelming majority of american voters are disgusted by the state of us politics and most view trump and clinton as dishonest 
more than  percent of voters say the presidential campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited the poll found 
having the two most hated politicians running for president of the us representing the two largest political parties has made a mockery of our democracy and electoral process hoenig told press tv on friday 
hillary clinton lied and stole her way to the nomination for the democrats and trump bullied his way by insulting every interest group in america including his fellow republican opponents he added 
for the third parties we have gary johnson of the libertarian party who has been made a laughing stock for his ignorance of foreign policy his poll numbers are dropping the other rd party candidate is jill stein of the green party who is seeing an actual rise in her numbers in spite of lies and smears coming from mostly the democrats with assistance from the main stream media he said 
that the race is tightening is no surprise it often happens at this time but the reasons now are not because people are becoming more assured of who they want but more and more disgusted in the choices they have he stated 
regardless of who wins and its most probable that itll be either clinton or trump this countrys nightmare will only begin on jan st the day after the inauguration if its clinton one wouldnt be surprised if the ink on the articles of impeachment isnt already dried by then its possible that criminal charges will have been presented to her or that she had received by then a presidential pardon from the outgoing president obama the analyst noted

dna india 
the worlds largest and most sensitive cosmic ray monitor located in india has recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays that indicates a crack in the earths magnetic shield according to scientists 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona struck earth at a very high speed causing massive compression of the earths magnetosphere and triggering a severe geomagnetic storm 
the grapes muon telescope located at tata institute of fundamental researchs cosmic ray laboratory in ooty in tamil nadu recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays of about  gev last year lasting for two hours 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona and moving with a speed of about  million kilometres per hour struck our planet causing a severe compression of earths magnetosphere from  to  times the radius of earth 
it triggered a severe geomagnetic storm that generated aurora borealis and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries according to the study published in the journal physical review letters this week 
earths magnetosphere extends over a radius of a million kilometres which acts as the first line of defence shielding us from the continuous flow of solar and galactic cosmic rays thus protecting life on our planet from these high intensity energetic radiations 
numerical simulations performed by the grapes researchers including pravata k mohanty indicate that the earths magnetic shield temporarily cracked due to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere 
earths magnetic field bent these particles about  degree from the dayside to the nightside of the earth where it was detected as a burst by the grapes muon telescope around midnight on  june  
the data was analysed and interpreted through extensive simulation over several weeks by using the core computing farm that was built inhouse by the grapes team of physicists and engineers at the cosmic ray laboratory in ooty

new york city law enforcement authorities are on high alert after receiving a warning by the feds about a possible attack by al qaeda on the eve of election day sources said 
us intelligence officials alerted joint terrorism task forces of the threat which also included texas and virginia  though specific sites targeted for monday in the three states were not mentioned a federal source told the post 
mayor bill de blasio said friday he had learned of the threat several days ago during classified briefings 
we are still very much assessing the credibility it is not at all clear how credible this is de blasio told wnycs brian lehrer on his weekly radio show were certainly in a vigilant position 
hizzoner said the nypd is planning an extraordinary police presence for tuesday when americans go to the polls 
for the first time in memory there will be two presidential campaigns having their victory celebrations in new york city on tuesday night he said quickly correcting himself that only one candidate will be celebrating 
donald trump the republican nominee will be at the new york hilton midtown on sixth avenue while hillary clinton his democratic counterpart will be at the javits convention center across town on th avenue 
police also will be heavily deployed for the new york city marathon on sunday de blasio said 
meanwhile gov andrew cuomo declined to confirm the threat friday but also noted the high state of alert for election day 
we have more state police more national guard more soldiers on duty than ever before he said so the bad news is new york is often a threat the good news is weve been dealing with this now for over a decade and we have prepared for it 
the nypd and the port authority of new york and new jersey said they had been alerted to the possible attacks 
we are aware of the information we have been working with the fbi through the joint terrorism task force and our counterterrorism and intelligence bureaus the nypd said in a statement 
we continue to encourage anyone with any information that could be relevant to the safety of our city to contact law enforcement the department said 
the port authority  which operates airports tunnels and bridges in and around the big apple  said it too was prepared 
we are continuing the high level of security we have had in place at all of our facilities for many months spokesman steve coleman told the post 
the fbi did not comment specifically about the threat against the three states but said counterterrorism and homeland security authorities remain vigilant and wellpostured to handle attacks 
the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety an fbi official said

usa today 
the man who caused a commotion at a donald trump rally saturday said hes a registered republican who wanted only to show his displeasure with his partys nominee 
members of the audience at the event for the gop presidential nominee tackled austyn crites  of reno after someone yelled gun while others were trying to rip away his antitrump sign 
i just went with sign that said republicans against trump  crites said its a sign that you can find online i held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands 
crites had no weapon secret service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges 
agents whisked trump offstage because crites was near the front of the auditorium at the renosparks convention center 
crites said he holds no ill will toward the secret service or reno police who were just doing their job 
i was trying to get the secret services attention for them to respond said michael newton  of santa rosa calif who helped restrain crites they didnt respond i thought i had to do something i put my knee on what i think was his head so im not really sure there were five guys on him and he was moving i tried to help them immobilize him in final colorado push trump urges supporters to handdeliver ballots 
newton said he felt as if crites were the aggressor 
i saw his hand contact someones face he said maybe two people 
crites said he didnt strike anyone but after he was taken to the ground he felt as if he were being mobbed 
multiple people just tackled me down kicking me choking me and just beating me up he said thats when things even got crazier i was on the ground and people were holding my arms legs and i kept saying i can barely breathe i was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out 
thats when police intervened taking crites away in handcuffs 
newtons partner donald newton  of santa rosa took video of the immediate aftermath 
the secret service said its investigation is ongoing the agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events 
whats baffling to crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun his sign was in the air for some time and he wasnt making any sudden movements he said 
it wasnt like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me crites said thats not the case 
he said he backs some gop candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with trump not cause panic 
i love all the people in that rally he said were all fellow americans theyre doing their patriotic duty they support their candidate im just there showing that im a republican im all of your peoples brother i just have a slight difference of opinion 
later on facebook crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours contributed to her campaign and voted for her 
take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence  against your own republican brother with a stupid sign he wrote the post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some trump supporters on social media called him a clinton thughillary shill and trump assassin 
shortly after the incident at the rally trump returned to the stage to raucous applause thanking the secret service and launching back into his prepared remarks his campaign later issued a statement also thanking the secret service and his supporters

Alex Ansary,2016-11-05T00:33:12.210+02:00,bill clinton and hillary lolita express pedophilia ring,"opinion hillary is the whore of babylon and is not human  
tracy twyman 
i put some of this information in an article i published yesterday morning about a larger subject today i have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged 
people in the fbi think hillary clinton is the antichrist  they are close she is the whore of babylon 
hillary was born in  supposedly i looked for this information on a hunch after noticing several clues and sure enough back in  someone on david ickes forum speculated that hillary may have been the moonchild that according to artist marjorie cameron  was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist occultist and crowley associate jack parsons during a ritual called the  babalon working  the purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what crowley called  babalon  the scarlet whore with the cup of blood foretold in st johns revelation that rides the beast 
cameron actually claimed that this fetus after being taken from her womb was delivered to people involved in the militarys nuclear weapons progranm who were apparently in cahoots with parsons and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested but the fetus survived she said because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose for the  trinity bomb test they made a special canister called jumbo that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off they reportedly didnt end up using it for that but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the moonchild presumably it grew up to be somebody 
crowley named one of his female consorts who he always called his scarlet women hilarion her name was jeanne foster crowleys attempt to conceive an heir as a magical child with hilarion resulted supposedly in the childs spirit being attached to his protege charles stanfield jones back in  the attachment allegedly occurred when jones went through the ritual for crossing the abyss in the th degree of the oto which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group 
jack parsons another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual channeled the book of the antichrist in  where he foretold 
and within seven years of this time babalon the scarlet woman hilarion will manifest among ye and bring this my work to its fruition 
i also believe that hillary with her notorious cracking voice and possibly her rival trump were foretold in another document channeled by parsons the book of babalon  
her voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long the gates shall fall and the irons break in the birth of babalon 
in rome the hilaria was a festival to the goddess cybele worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone to celebrate the resurrection of her son who as the legend states she had been having sex with she then became jealous of his love of others castrated him and let him die of bleeding the reason why all of her priests the galli were castrated and actually considered women she later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously as commemorated in this festival consider this next time you notice hillary clinton laughing inappropriately 
also note that hillary clinton has made several selfdepricating jokes about herself being  not even human  and shortcircuiting when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies specifically in october  when her interviewer at buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating even though it was a hot day odd because hillary has notoriously bad bo she asked hillary what kind of deodorant she used clintons reply was astounding

Alex Ansary,2016-11-07T02:09:02.970+02:00,the man behind the trump rally disturbance in reno,"us military hackers claim penetration of russia  
sputnik news 
us military hackers have penetrated russias electric grid telecommunications networks and kremlins command systems making them vulnerable to attack by secret american cyber weapons according to a series of reports by a major us television network 
nbc news disclosed the penetration in a series of reports explaining that us efforts parallel claims also by us officials that russia china and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of us critical infrastructure 
the penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an allout war in cyberspace according to nbc news which said it was briefed by a us intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents 
at the same time the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to us adversaries 
nbc news then attempted to link its explosive report to tuesdays us presidential election citing concerns of mischief by russian hackers that would fall far short of the armageddonlike scenario that the report implied 
instead the network explained us electionrelated concerns as cyber mischief which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation 
the obama administration has created a public but unconfirmed narrative that hackers controlled by the russian government have stolen emails from the democratic party headquarters a private computer used by presidential candidate hillary clinton while serving as secretary of state and computers used by clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
according to the narrative russia stole the emails and gave the messages to wikileaks which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to tuesdays election 
russia has denied any responsibility for the clintonrelated hacks and links between wikileaks and russian intelligence have never been substantiated 
moreover recent media reports in the united states indicate that clintons private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services 
the emails have proved especially embarrassing for the clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the clinton state department that favored large donors to the clinton foundation in what appear to be payforplay schemes of selling access and influence 
moreover the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former president bill clinton",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/636139958247519037-AP-Campaign-2016-Trump-001.jpg,bs,man behind trump rally disturbance reno,us military hackers claim penetration russia sputnik news us military hackers penetrated russias electric grid telecommunications networks kremlins command systems making vulnerable attack secret american cyber weapons according series reports major us television network nbc news disclosed penetration series reports explaining us efforts parallel claims also us officials russia china nations placed hidden malware parts us critical infrastructure penetration sides appears preparation allout war cyberspace according nbc news said briefed us intelligence official given opportunity review highly classified documents time network downplayed prospect cyber war making appear leak intended warning us adversaries nbc news attempted link explosive report tuesdays us presidential election citing concerns mischief russian hackers would fall far short armageddonlike scenario report implied instead network explained us electionrelated concerns cyber mischief could involve releasing fake documents creating bogus social media accounts spread misinformation obama administration created public unconfirmed narrative hackers controlled russian government stolen emails democratic party headquarters private computer used presidential candidate hillary clinton serving secretary state computers used clinton campaign chairman john podesta according narrative russia stole emails gave messages wikileaks flooded internet material daily basis leading tuesdays election russia denied responsibility clintonrelated hacks links wikileaks russian intelligence never substantiated moreover recent media reports united states indicate clintons private server used official business tenure secretary state penetrated least five foreign intelligence services emails proved especially embarrassing clinton campaign disclosing decisions clinton state department favored large donors clinton foundation appear payforplay schemes selling access influence moreover activity appears coincide lucrative speaking engagements former president bill clinton,1,,,,,

pj media 
valerie jarrettbarack obamas closest consigliere who has lived in the lap of luxury in and out of the white houseis calling for james comeys head because the fbi director reopened the matter of hillary clintons emails only days before the election 
as we all know comey did this after some  digital missives many from clintons server were discovered on anthony weiners laptop by the nypd 
obama however is a bit uneasy about jarretts hawkishness toward comey 
valerie argued that comey was interfering deliberately in the election process and had to be stopped a source told the new york post  the same source said obama though is worried about the consequences of taking such an action  the tsunami of outrage that would come his way and possibly become a major footnote or worse in the history of the presidency 
ah those legacy problems not that the president has much of one outside the comically named affordable care act which is about as popular as stomach cancer 
nevertheless hes right about the tsunami of outrage in fact its an understatement the bad news is this as miserable as this endless election season has been the aftermath is likely to be far worse you dont have to be nostradamus to see that putting the american humpty dumpty together again is going to be a herculean task our country could be permanently fractured in ways few of us would have anticipated even a year ago anything is possible now 
if hillary clinton is elected the very next day millions of americans will be watching to see what will happen with the fbi and the justice department since we can now assume this will be a close election that would be nearly half the voters in this country sixty to seventy million people almost all of whom believe clinton the woman a few weeks from inauguration as president should have been charged with serious crimes and belonged behind bars not in the white house 
moreover many have seen the wikileaks that reek of collusion between the clintonistas and officials at the fbi and justice not to mention with virtually all the mainstream media outlets that were distrusted to begin with and are now reviled 
if thats not an explosive situation what is and we dont know what assange et al have in store for us after the election just now we learned that the clinton foundation acceptedwhile her ladyship was secretary of state and in honor of bills birthdayan unreported one million dollar donation from that paragon of womens and gay rights qatar this is chump change in the grand clinton scheme of things but another reminder of their unending greed and corruption more importantly as tyler durden points out this time there should be legal consequences for the foundationor would be normally in a country governed by the rule of law 
only were not anymore 
this and a thousand other things put obama quite possibly liable himself from the email disclosures and his attorney general lynch behind a treacherous eight ball going forward because they are not dealing with a few thousand disgruntled people but those many millions if they were to go ahead with jarretts suggestion take comeys head i e fire him and replace him with a yet more complaisant successor who knows what would happen 
but if they dont and even if they do the investigation may reveal things so shocking the nation will never be the same rumors have been flying that are so extreme that even a ten percent accuracy rate could ignite a firestorm 
the problem for all of us is that there is literally nothing clinton can do to get out of this box even if as many predict obama pardons her the corruption is so pervasive there is no way short of an actual military putsch to stop the continuing revelations and such an action would itself unleash  well you know the title of this article

press tv 
democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads her republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the white house according to a new poll 
the final bloomberg politicsselzer  co poll released on monday has clinton ahead of trump  percent to  percent 
libertarian candidate gary johnson was at  percent and green party candidate jill stein had  percent support 
clinton also leads trump by three points in a hypothetical twoway matchup when thirdparty candidates are not included 
another tracking poll released early on monday also put clinton in the lead 
the former secretary of state held a fourpoint lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest abc newswashington post poll the survey showed  percent of likely us voters backed clinton while  percent said they supported trump 
the clinton campaign received a late break with fbi director james comey announcing sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of clintons newlyfound emails 
based on our review we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july the fbi chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen 
the development is a major relief to clinton who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close trumps path to presidency donald trump walks off the stage after holding a rally at loudoun fairgrounds in leesburg virginia early in the morning on november   photo by afp 
comey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to congress saying the fbi had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into clintons use of a private server when she was secretary of state 
the surprise move infuriated democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of trump who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against clinton 
still trump continued to seize on the email issue insisting that clinton is guilty 
hillary clinton is guilty she knows it the fbi knows it the people know he said sunday at a rally in detroit michigan and now its up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on november  
both clinton and trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of tuesdays election

Alex Ansary,2016-11-07T20:01:08.718+02:00,kremlin nato was created for agression,"janet reno first female us attorney general dies at   
npr 
janet reno the first woman to serve as attorney general of the united states died early monday from complications of parkinsons disease renos goddaughter gabrielle dalemberte and sister margaret hurchalla confirmed her passing to npr 
reno spent her final days at home in miami surrounded by family and friends dalemberte told the associated press she was  
reno served longer in the job than anyone had in  years and her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy but she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments 
she was not president bill clintons first choice to head the justice department nor his second but after his no  pick went down in confirmation flames and his second choice also proved controversial clinton finally turned to reno 
she was an unexpected pick she had no connections to clinton or washington but clinton wanted a woman and reno was a bigtime prosecutor holding the top prosecutors job in miamidade county a position she had been elected to four times over  years 
jamie gorelick who would later become deputy attorney general was assigned to prep reno for her confirmation hearing she was the least airbrushed candidate we have ever had for a cabinetlevel position says gorelick she was herself and she didnt change herself for washington 
reno arrived at the justice department knowing no one and was immediately plunged into the siege at the branch davidian compound outside waco texas four federal agents had been killed and  wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns seven weeks into the siege pressed by the fbi reno authorized a raid on the compound resulting in  deaths including as many as  children and the davidian leader david koresh who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound 
in two sets of waco congressional hearings over the next two years reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left 
what haunted me reno explained at one hearing was that if i did not go in i might be sitting there  days later  when koresh came out with explosives blew himself some agents and the entire place up 
years later however in an interview with npr shortly before leaving office her regret was palpable well never know whether it was a mistake or not in one sense reno admitted but knowing what i do i would not do it again i would try to figure another way 
waco didnt make her hesitant it made her insistent about getting her own information observes walter dellinger who served in two top justice department jobs under reno 
dellinger believes for instance that it may have been the waco experience that led reno to go personally to miami in april  to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of yearold cuban refugee elián gonzález from the home of a greatuncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent in cuba 
elián had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the united states rescued by fishermen and brought to the us he was soon turned over to his greatuncle the cuban community in miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father who lived in cuba and the furor soon bled over to congress 
but when negotiations with the greatuncle failed armed federal agents acting on renos orders raided the home removed elián and turned him over to his father who had come to the us to receive his son when the us supreme court refused to intervene the two returned to their home in cuba 
janet reno takes the oath as attorney general during a ceremony at the white house on march   while president bill clinton watches 
barry thummaap 
over the course of time reno would become embroiled in many controversies she sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow cabinet members and president clinton himself but she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the clintongore campaign after justice department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president 
the decision so infuriated republicans that some called for her impeachment this is the most politicized justice department in the history of the united states railed dan burton the republican chairman of a key house oversight committee 
at  feet  inches however reno stood tall in the political crosswinds gorelick observes that when members of congress like burton were unhappy with a government official they threatened to call that official to testify but reno who had served as a staffer in the florida state legislature always said fine ill be there as a result says gorelick eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that because she prevailed in every outing that i can recall  she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her 
the controversies that the justice department faced during renos reign often eclipsed the many things that went well the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers for example the pursuit of bombers of womens health clinics that provide abortions and the solving of the socalled unabomber case 
after nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit the fbi still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the unabomber who had killed three people and injured  then in  the bomber sent a letter to the new york times offering to cease his terror campaign if the times or the washington post would publish his word manifesto against modern industry and technology neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially but reno the daughter of two newspaper journalists persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety 
it paid off the unabombers brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the fbi ending the bombers long reign of terror theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison 
in  reno was diagnosed with parkinsons disease she did not slow down but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing she even joked about the disease claiming that shaking sometimes helps as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak 
that combination of toughness and selfdeprecating humor plus her determination to protect the justice department from improper influence made her a hero to many who worked for her 
janet reno led with her values says former deputy attorney general gorelick the departments no  official and that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her  id never seen that before in quite the same way 
florida gubernatorial candidate and former us attorney general janet reno speaks at the florida democratic party state conference on april   in lake buena vista fla she lost the democratic primary 
reno won enormous respect inside the department as well because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the justice department  from national security to environmental questions to the generally obscure field of indian law 
us attorney general loretta lynch called her one of the most effective decisive and wellrespectedleaders in the departments proud history who never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility and former attorney general eric holder said that in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain janet reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values 
former solicitor general dellinger believes that reno was prepared for the attorney generals job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height this is a woman that went to cornell and harvard law school at a time when very few women went to harvard law school went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart  and thats really really tough 
there were of course ups and downs in the eight years of renos reign but she said she always took the long view of her job 
if the end brings me out right what people said about me wont make any difference and if the end brings me out wrong  angels saying i was right wont make any difference she said in an interview with npr in  
president clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with reno and the wall of separation she erected between the justice department and the white house still he never asked her to resign reno was the last cabinet member he reappointed after his reelection in  
it was actually quite wonderful said dellinger she just decided to stay and it turns out that nobody could fire her 
the tension between clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as clintons time in office drew to a close in an interview with cbs news  minutes  clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike but when it came to his evaluation of reno he was tepid to say the least 
good woman he said tried really hard to do a good job shes a good person 
at least he didnt say i was a bad person replied reno with a laugh ill take what i can get 
indeed by the end of her tenure janet reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian will ferrells parody of her became one of the iconic skits on nbcs saturday night live  the recurring skit was inspired by reports that reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a justice department party 
on the last episode of the janet renos dance party parody ferrell wearing a blue dress and pearls reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near then suddenly the real janet reno comes crashing through the wall of the set wearing the same blue dress and pearls as ferrell to deliver one of ferrells signature lines its reno time

cbs 
a magnitude  earthquake centered near one of the worlds key oil hubs brought down building facades and shattered windows in a central oklahoma city rendering centuryold buildings unsafe and raising concerns about key infrastructure 
as the sun rose monday television news footage showed widespread substantial damage to buildings with piles of bricks and other debris littering the ground following the earthquake the previous evening cushing assistant city manager jeremy frazier told a news conference late sunday that a few minor injuries had been reported he said the damage appeared to be contained downtown 
oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production sundays quake was centered  mile west of cushing and about  miles south of where a magnitude  quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week 
fearing aftershocks police cordoned off older parts of the city to keep gawkers away late sunday and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area frazier said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported the cushing public school district canceled monday classes 
stay out of the area said city manager steve spears who noted that while some damage was superficial compromised foundations and other potential problems would be difficult to assess until daylight in the city of  about  miles northeast of oklahoma city 
the oklahoma department of transportation reported sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a mile radius of the earthquakes epicenter 
the quake struck at  pm sunday and was felt as far away as iowa illinois and texas the us geological survey initially said sundays quake was of magnitude  but later lowered the reading to  
i thought my whole trailer was going to tip over it was shaking it so bad said cushing resident cindy roe  it was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground 
it was awful and i dont want to have another one 
cushings oil storage terminal is one of the worlds largest as of oct  tank farms in the countryside around cushing held  million barrels of crude oil according to data from the us energy information administration the community bills itself as the pipeline crossroads of the world 
frazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late sunday but that the community hadnt heard from all companies gov mary fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at cushings oil storage terminal 
megan gustafson and jonathan gillespie were working at a cushing mcdonalds when the quake hit 
it felt like a train was going right through the building actually gustafson  said sunday night as she and her coworkers stood behind a police barricade downtown looking for damage i kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit 
gillespie said the building shook for about  seconds but that he wasnt as alarmed as gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes especially in recent years 
i didnt think it was anything new he said 
according to usgs data there have been about two dozen earthquakes in oklahoma in the past week when particularly strong quakes hit the oklahoma corporation commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume 
a  earthquake  a record for oklahoma  hit pawnee on sept  shortly afterward geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault

Alex Ansary,2016-11-07T20:01:08.838+02:00,janet reno first female us attorney general dies at,"las vegas may become the new amsterdam  
high times 
nevada already has legal brothels roundtheclock casinos and a coy catchphrase declaring that what happens in vegas stays in vegas if voters approve the state could soon add another vice in the form of recreational marijuana 
a proposal on the nov  state ballot would legalize pot and entrepreneurs hope its passage could someday allow the drug at las vegas glamorous nightclubs and perhaps provide the framework for a future amsterdamstyle cannabis district 
i really think this would be the thirdlargest market in the country said derek peterson whose company operates medical marijuana dispensaries called blum he predicts that only california and new york would offer a bigger customer base than las vegas and its  million tourists a year i think it should be able to fit in really well with the whole dayclubnightclub thing 
nevada has allowed medical marijuana since  and peterson sees recreational pot as an alternative for visitors tired of cocktails that can top  apiece and inflict hangovers but before waitresses begin delivering highgrade marijuana at clubs along the las vegas strip weed proponents will have to win over not just voters who narrowly support the initiative in polls but a riskaverse casino industry 
the nevada resort association came out against the measure pointing to an opinion from gambling regulators that casino owners should avoid the marijuana industry because the substance remains illegal under federal law las vegas sands owner sheldon adelson has bankrolled most of the opposition pouring  million of his fortune into a campaign that raises the possibility that small children could become intoxicated from candylike marijuana edibles 
adelson also has contributed  million in arizona and massachusetts a significant share of all antimarijuana donations there 
adelson whose son died of a drug overdose and whose wife is a doctor specializing in drug addiction has donated millions toward efforts to defeat medical marijuana proposals in florida and other states in years past 
other casino operators have joined the fray but to a lesser extent 
in spite of its libertine reputation the rigorously regulated casino industry is known to err on the conservative side to avoid scandalizing the middleaged tourists who are its bread and butter 
i dont know that this is a game changer in terms of tourism virginia valentine president of the nevada resort association said of marijuanas potential were really known for other things you may attract people or turn them off 
the las vegas convention and visitors authority which promotes sin citys amenities to the world is neutral on the issue 
clyde barrow a gambling expert who chairs the political science department at the university of texasrio grande valley suggests the donations may indicate the casino companies are acting in their own best interests 
the marijuana industry is emerging as another form of recreation and entertainment given the casino industrys difficulties attracting millennials marijuana is probably perceived as a direct competitor with casinos for entertainment dollars he said another reason is that legalized marijuana competes with alcohol and to that extent competes with the food and beverage sales at casinos 
theres no solid statesponsored research on how legal recreational marijuana has affected tourism in places that have legalized it although both sides point to colorado to make their case 
promarijuana interests cite a state study that found colorado set an alltime tourism record in  capping a fifth year of growth its unclear how much of that is due to weed and how much can be chalked up to other factors such as good snow in recent years relative to competing ski states 
marijuana opponents refer to a report from the visit denver tourism bureau that logged increasing complaints about panhandling and open marijuana consumption in the citys downtown corridor 
denver is losing visitors and valuable convention business as a result of these overall safety or perception of safety issues the report said we fear not being able to brand denver away from this growing reputation 
nevadas ballot initiative would not allow municipalities to put blanket bans on marijuana as colorado does but it would bar consumption in buildings that are open to the public and permit local governments to restrict the locations of marijuana dispensaries and related businesses it effectively blocks people from growing their own by banning the practice within  miles of a licensed marijuana store",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ap04041306797_wide-3b32aeee98f9b05524d232d32b05fd9f16f2dee9-s800-c85.jpg,bs,janet reno first female us attorney general dies,las vegas may become new amsterdam high times nevada already legal brothels roundtheclock casinos coy catchphrase declaring happens vegas stays vegas voters approve state could soon add another vice form recreational marijuana proposal nov state ballot would legalize pot entrepreneurs hope passage could someday allow drug las vegas glamorous nightclubs perhaps provide framework future amsterdamstyle cannabis district really think would thirdlargest market country said derek peterson whose company operates medical marijuana dispensaries called blum predicts california new york would offer bigger customer base las vegas million tourists year think able fit really well whole dayclubnightclub thing nevada allowed medical marijuana since peterson sees recreational pot alternative visitors tired cocktails top apiece inflict hangovers waitresses begin delivering highgrade marijuana clubs along las vegas strip weed proponents win voters narrowly support initiative polls riskaverse casino industry nevada resort association came measure pointing opinion gambling regulators casino owners avoid marijuana industry substance remains illegal federal law las vegas sands owner sheldon adelson bankrolled opposition pouring million fortune campaign raises possibility small children could become intoxicated candylike marijuana edibles adelson also contributed million arizona massachusetts significant share antimarijuana donations adelson whose son died drug overdose whose wife doctor specializing drug addiction donated millions toward efforts defeat medical marijuana proposals florida states years past casino operators joined fray lesser extent spite libertine reputation rigorously regulated casino industry known err conservative side avoid scandalizing middleaged tourists bread butter dont know game changer terms tourism virginia valentine president nevada resort association said marijuanas potential really known things may attract people turn las vegas convention visitors authority promotes sin citys amenities world neutral issue clyde barrow gambling expert chairs political science department university texasrio grande valley suggests donations may indicate casino companies acting best interests marijuana industry emerging another form recreation entertainment given casino industrys difficulties attracting millennials marijuana probably perceived direct competitor casinos entertainment dollars said another reason legalized marijuana competes alcohol extent competes food beverage sales casinos theres solid statesponsored research legal recreational marijuana affected tourism places legalized although sides point colorado make case promarijuana interests cite state study found colorado set alltime tourism record capping fifth year growth unclear much due weed much chalked factors good snow recent years relative competing ski states marijuana opponents refer report visit denver tourism bureau logged increasing complaints panhandling open marijuana consumption citys downtown corridor denver losing visitors valuable convention business result overall safety perception safety issues report said fear able brand denver away growing reputation nevadas ballot initiative would allow municipalities put blanket bans marijuana colorado would bar consumption buildings open public permit local governments restrict locations marijuana dispensaries related businesses effectively blocks people growing banning practice within miles licensed marijuana store,1,,,,,

they say we will take ten billion euros from a french bank and seven billion euros from a german bank our european partners agree with this medvedev said

press tv 
experts say the outlook for saudi economic recovery will remain murky for many months to come with some even warning that the worst of the economic slump for the kingdom is yet to come 
reuters in a report quoted several riyadhbased experts as saying that there would be a high degree of uncertainty over the status of the saudi economy in  that would mainly be a result of the remaining challenges from the private sector 
the saudi economy may appear to have escaped a fiscal and currency crisis that loomed at the start of  however experts said threats from certain basic problems still remain and will haunt the kingdom next year 
the government owes its success to temporarily escape crisis to unpaid bills rather than sustainable spending cuts 
the government has reduced or suspended payments that it owed to construction firms medical establishments and even some of the foreign consultants who helped to design the economic reforms reuters added quoting the experts the estimated unpaid dues for construction firms alone totaled  billion riyals 
experts further warned that this could store up obligations for riyadh in the future 
reuters elsewhere emphasized that signs of the economic slump could be seen in riyadh and other major cities where discounts of  percent or more are offered by stores selling clothes and consumer electronics and there is a surge in people offering secondhand cars for sale 
the biggest uncertainty may be how authorities can push through a key part of their reform drive added the report the most important issue for the saudis may be determining how they plan to foster a vibrant private sector that does not depend on oil revenues while at the same pushing ahead austerity policies that are suppressing private demand 
experts also warned that the status of the saudi job market over the next few years between  million and  million of saudi arabias  million foreign workers may leave over the next couple of years as the economic slowdown causes layoffs and the government seeks to steer saudi citizens into jobs previously held by foreigners reuters added",english,amtvmedia.com,http://www.amtvmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Las-Vegas-HD-Pics-04173-990x556.jpg,bs,las vegas may become new amsterdam,worst saudi economic slump yet come press tv experts say outlook saudi economic recovery remain murky many months come even warning worst economic slump kingdom yet come reuters report quoted several riyadhbased experts saying would high degree uncertainty status saudi economy would mainly result remaining challenges private sector saudi economy may appear escaped fiscal currency crisis loomed start however experts said threats certain basic problems still remain haunt kingdom next year government owes success temporarily escape crisis unpaid bills rather sustainable spending cuts government reduced suspended payments owed construction firms medical establishments even foreign consultants helped design economic reforms reuters added quoting experts estimated unpaid dues construction firms alone totaled billion riyals experts warned could store obligations riyadh future reuters elsewhere emphasized signs economic slump could seen riyadh major cities discounts percent offered stores selling clothes consumer electronics surge people offering secondhand cars sale biggest uncertainty may authorities push key part reform drive added report important issue saudis may determining plan foster vibrant private sector depend oil revenues pushing ahead austerity policies suppressing private demand experts also warned status saudi job market next years million million saudi arabias million foreign workers may leave next couple years economic slowdown causes layoffs government seeks steer saudi citizens jobs previously held foreigners reuters added,1,,,,,

clinton calls them her hillblazers campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least  for her campaign and she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of  such people  nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate including president obama four years ago 
while clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors it is these bundlers in more than  states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation combined this elite andup club has amassed a minimum of  million for clinton and the democratic party  and the actual figure is likely far far higher than that the biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns

the clinton campaign said  percent of its bundlers are women 
there are also federal lobbyists from whom the democratic party under obama refused to accept money a prohibition that has since been rolled back 
this club has expanded to the point where clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom as of the end of june she counted  such individuals and couples by the end of july it was  on august  it was

aides to the republican nominee told fox news that trump victory the joint fundraising committee for the gop and the campaign held its most recent fundraiser on oct  and no more such events were scheduled 
the move which was first reported by the washington post cuts off a key money source for republicans hoping to keep hold of both houses of congress 
weve kind of wound down trump national finance chairman steven mnuchin told the post but the online fundraising continues to be strong 
by contrast the post reported that democrat hillary clintons campaign has scheduled  fundraising events between now and nov  the former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance tuesday in miami 
mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race 
we have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political events mnuchin said of the candidate unlike hillary who has been fundraising and not out and about he has constantly been out and about

when breitbart news washington political editor matthew boyle confronted mook about creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate mook claimed theyve never worked for our campaign when asked if clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with creamer directly mook replied i dont think so 
now however okeefe and project veritas have released video of creamer claiming that clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans  an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a donald duck costume and sending that activist into trump events emphasizing the argument that trump was ducking releasing his tax returns

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/1477424841us-735x400.jpg,conspiracy,us israeli lawmakers want pakistan declared terrorist country,email democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday believes catholic church change position samesex marriage virginia senator said like changed opinion issue catholic church also likely follow suit speaking th annual human rights campaigns national dinner washington roman catholic senator reportedly said think going change church also teaches creator first chapter genesis surveyed entire world including mankind said good besides continued talking country based founded democracy core value definition means every single person every single citizen able scratch encouraged practice civil religious sexual liberties best abilities im sorry people dont like deny samesex marriage country first one accept pointless catholic church also accepting instead condemning right kaine also added else fails ways making catholic church listen voice reason dubbed advocate lgbt equality end day know civilized people course first thing well act nicely ask nicely said doesnt work well use law legal system enable rather lbgt community supreme courts ruling samesex marriage crucial milestone legal system proves works actually functions im saying argued respect catholic church im sure millions americans know point going start acting contrary christian faith talking institution thats supposed first one front line defending happens thats whats happening condemning lgbt rights well state ultimatum united states america precisely future president united states america hillary clinton state ultimatum ultimatum either change stance samesex marriage pack bags get america yes president country case anybodys wondering donald trump wont doesnt care anyone donald trump hand hillary clinton shining example honesty integrity democracy rest assured everything power president make sure gays lesbians throughout america loved respected viewed equals presidential term happens problem kaine concluded,1,,,,,

hillary clinton declared during nbc newss commanderinchief forum that no lives were lost in libya when she made the move to take out dictator muammar gaddafi even so the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that  months later four americans  including us ambassador christopher stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created 
that was one of the few situations in american foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move and the operation was a success even donald trump supported it clinton argued as with any operation of such magnitude we had a few hiccups but it was nothing out of the ordinary as ive said the operation was a success 
she continued so much so in fact that im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all and when i say that i say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that libyans could be freed from the iron fist of gaddafi it would have been unrealistic to expect  casualties however the overall toll did not exceed expectations with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy 
politics can be a cruel line of work that being said i stand before you here today and i am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it and while were on the subject of sacrifices thank god they did not include anyone important from the american delegation including yours truly she said jokingly causing the auditorium to laugh 
she said but all jokes aside i have to pay homage to the cia who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come if it hadnt been for them we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations i am proud that the united states of america has an intelligence agency such as the cia 
im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay a bargain if you will when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist i would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region for better of worse we acted and i am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the cia out of a deal because in the words of a personal friend of mine who is a former cia spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part she concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775662771.jpg,conspiracy,busted bill recorded telling mistress deny clintons helped get state job,email hillary clinton declared nbc newss commanderinchief forum lives lost libya made move take dictator muammar gaddafi even former secretary state mention fact months later four americans including us ambassador christopher stevens killed terrorist attack benghazi arose instability overthrow created one situations american foreign policy decision making processes everybody came together make sure dont make wrong move operation success even donald trump supported clinton argued operation magnitude hiccups nothing ordinary ive said operation success continued much fact im proud say important people lost say say utmost respect give lives sides libyans could freed iron fist gaddafi would unrealistic expect casualties however overall toll exceed expectations greater amount damage side enemy politics cruel line work said stand today proud say giving democracy people contact generations wonderful thing makes sacrifices worth subject sacrifices thank god include anyone important american delegation including truly said jokingly causing auditorium laugh said jokes aside pay homage cia performed outstandingly saved day agents work field immeasurable contribution asset would wise treasure generations come hadnt would able perform operation cleanly little impact surrounding nations proud united states america intelligence agency cia im sure many among disagree position one embassy small price pay bargain comes ridding world another dictator terrorist would also like remind everyone price would gone immeasurably sat idly allowed gaddafi rage cause death destruction throughout region better worse acted convinced dictator ever think cheating cia deal words personal friend mine former cia spook shutting arms dealers easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads hard part concluded,1,,,,,

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow her or bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on  the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushs plan on getting out of the country as well 
interestingly the bush familys nazi connections dating back to wwii seem to have played a part in the paraguay purchase since most nazis fled to south america after wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the nazis the bush family has a long history of being associated with nazis 
with the movement of huge amounts of funds selling millions of dollars in real estate and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions murdering us citizens in the thousands and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since  finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed 
we are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a nazi dictatorship in washington to an actual presidential administration who not only will look to the constitution as the basis of all laws but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people for the people and of the people of the usa not the dictatorship over the people to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775659851.jpg,conspiracy,hillary lose single important person libya,email appears bill hillary clinton making plans flee country event donald trump wins election reports circulating clintons transferred billion dollars clinton foundation qatar central bank via facilitationabatement jp morgan chase company reasons revealed move large sum money country qatar says hillary clinton knows going lose election doesnt plan allow bill prosecuted various high crimes treason trump administration country qatar happens one handful countries extradition treaty united states thus would perfect place run escaping justice donald trump said many times campaign presidential debates gets office intends prosecute various high crimes latest crimes sending classified material via personal email server gunrunning terrorist groups syria resulting deaths americans benghazi apparently hillary person washington made plans escape justice trump administration john kerry quietly selling property us millions dollars late announcement sale million nantucket mansion june well sale yacht million july president barack h obama also apparently making exit plans purchase million seaside mansion dubai january another non extradition country snopes supposed fact checking sites debunked story obamas purchase mansion firing rear admiral rick williams however last several months sites busted lying trying debunk information mentioned fact information true snopes sites try best keep incriminating information believed truth way coming always bush family quietly buying property well purchase acres paraguay yet another country good bush family since allow extradition country death penalty possibility crime corruption found go far back bush administrations connections perpetrators events death penalty would surely stipulation extradition request apparently things get going prosecuting corrupt treasonous bushs plan getting country well interestingly bush familys nazi connections dating back wwii seem played part paraguay purchase since nazis fled south america wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush director shareholder companies connected institutions financially backing nazis bush family long history associated nazis movement huge amounts funds selling millions dollars real estate purchase millions real estate overseas seeing plans corrupt washington ripping country trillions murdering us citizens thousands citizens foreign countries millions since finally realizing crimes humanity exposed also witnessing change amounts nothing nazi dictatorship washington actual presidential administration look constitution basis laws one going prosecute criminals government return government people people people usa dictatorship people people disregards people power,1,,,,,

two bill clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the clinton foundation  and even called the arrangement bill clinton inc 
doug band a top clinton aide detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company teneo and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked emails released wednesday by wikileaks 
teneo partners have raised in excess of  million for the foundation more than  million of which is in the bank the memo reads 
teneo partners also have generated over  million in paid speeches for president clinton  million of which has been paid to him thus far 
the consulting company was formed by band and former state department envoy declan kelly the memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president 
in one arrangement kelly introduced bob mccann the head of ubs wealth management to clinton at an event in  
after the meeting mccann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting clinton to give several paid speeches 
another arrangement involved the laureate foundation which donated more than  million to the clinton global initiative 
laureate was a personal advisory services business the memo said paying clinton ?million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman 
the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads

democratic vice president joe biden wants american women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy if we just put all the women back to work if they were able to afford childcare we would increase the gdp in america by close to eight tenths of one percent he said thats trillions of dollars over the next decade 
biden made his remarks during a campaign event for hillary clinton at chatham university in pittsburgh pennsylvania on tuesday the state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful he argued were still battling recession i dont care what the official stats are saying america is still in recession and were not doing anything about it 
he added that it was lazy american women who brought about the downfall of the economy because they sit around on their behinds doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them im not sure how exactly we got to this point but were here and we need to move like yesterday he said 
mark my words and mark them well he addressed the crowd hillary clinton is the only one who can force american women to go to work this is true because of a number of reasons first shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman so you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times 
second hillary clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house the children make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it the hard way i might add biden continued 
todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own the vice president said theyre too dependent too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy the reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply the demand for it rises even higher 
now thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests but if you look at the big picture its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce and thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces and like i said hillary clinton is the only one who can do it which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next president of the united states we need to heal this country folks not run it into the ground even deeper biden concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775655091.jpg,conspiracy,iowa farmer claims bill clinton sex cow cocaine party,email democratic vice president joe biden wants american women get back workforce help boost economy put women back work able afford childcare would increase gdp america close eight tenths one percent said thats trillions dollars next decade biden made remarks campaign event hillary clinton chatham university pittsburgh pennsylvania tuesday state economy could characterized single word pitiful argued still battling recession dont care official stats saying america still recession anything added lazy american women brought downfall economy sit around behinds nothing squandering days away could improving country given much im sure exactly got point need move like yesterday said mark words mark well addressed crowd hillary clinton one force american women go work true number reasons first shes woman woman shes selfmade woman better believe shes saying true tried tested practice plenty times second hillary clinton understands difficult give status freeloader husband breadwinner household wife expected tend house children make sure dinner served always mood marital duties shes shes learned break free hard way might add biden continued todays women pampered arent used rolling sleeves getting job done vice president said theyre dependent weak lazy contribute economy reason theyve learned manipulate men employing one fundamental laws economics soughtafter commodity becomes short supply demand rises even higher thats fine dandy comes personal interests look big picture economy thats missing valuable workforce thats need get lazy behinds get workplaces like said hillary clinton one makes ideal candidate next president united states need heal country folks run ground even deeper biden concluded,1,,,,,

the moroccan monarchs funds went to the clinton foundations endowment and to cgi the jan   email was included in wikileaks latest batch of communications to and from clintons presidential campaign chairman john podesta 
the email from huma abedin clintons deputy chief of staff at the state department was addressed to podesta and campaign manager robby mook hillary clinton was a director of the foundation at the time 
singapore and hong kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the cgi meeting in their countries but the north african nation ultimately hosted it in a fivestar hotel in marrakesh morocco in  abedin told podesta and mook that morocco was not cgis first choice

the mining company also contributed between  million to  million to the clinton foundation according to the charitys web siteabedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss hillary clinton created this mess and she knows it she told podesta and mookshe said the moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss this was hrcs idea our office approached the moroccans and they  percent believe they are doing this at her request the king has personally committed approx  million both for the endowment and to support the meeting hrc stands for hillary rodham clinton 
abedin said clintons attendance at the cgi event was a condition of the  million contribution just to give you some context the condition upon which the moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation if hrc was not part if it meeting was a nonstarter abedin said 
politico in  reported that clinton was seen by rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the obama administration rabat is the capital of morocco 
the robert f kennedy center for justice charged ocp with serious human rights violations including exploitation of workers by not adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there 
mohamed yeslem beisat the washington envoy for the polisaro front as reported by almonitor a middle east news site in  that ocp is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation  it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past  years 
polisaro claims to lead a moroccan governmentinexile based in tindouf algeria 
theyre doing this because they know hillary has some chances of being president of the united states and they want her to support their brutal occupation of western sahara beisat charged 
the moroccan firm mines phosphates human rights critics have called ocps mining product blood phosphates appropriating the term blood diamonds for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
ocp is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the clinton foundation the foundation accepted a  million pledge from lukas lundin who owns mining and oil drilling operations in north africa and in the congo related clinton foundation got m from blood minerals firm 
ocp retained the law firm of covington  burling one of washingtons lobbying giants paying the firm  million in fees from  to  
stuart eizenstat a former white house domestic policy chief under president carter and an influential democratic party insider was the main lobbyist for the mining firm he was also president bill clintons ambassador to the european union a deputy secretary of the treasury and under secretary at the department of commerce

hillary clinton officially visited morocco twice in november  and in february  meeting with the king on both occasions the two also met in new york in december  where it was believed the two discussed moroccos bid to host the cgi meeting and the kings  million donation 
the moroccan world news described the meeting as showing renewed friendship between the royal family and the clinton family as well as hillary clintons esteem for morocco and its people 
abedin warned both campaign executives that if cgi decided to renege on the agreement it would hurt clintons relationship with the king it will break a lot of china to back out now she wrote

donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/1477586227636130853168961052.jpg,conspiracy,trump warns world war iii clinton elected,email donald trump riling voting base claims november election rigged course large scale voter fraud happening election day trump tweeted monday morning republican leaders deny going naive charge even republicans quick refute critics called talk potentially dangerous detrimental trust us democratic process states backed tens thousands gop dem volunteers ensure integrity electoral process sen jeff flake arizona often sharply critical trump tweeted sunday elections rigged jon husted secretary state ohio top election official key battleground state also said monday could assure trump election would rigged trumps recent claims coincided plunge polls trump recently made similar claims polls numbers taking dive early august im telling november wed better careful election going rigged new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity august hope republicans watching closely going taken away us multiple republicans told business insider time trumps assertion ludicrous dangerous trump would first us presidential candidate modern times possibly ever blame election loss voter fraud rigged election allen raymond former gop operative involved new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence election would rigged detrimental republic idea rigged dont know hes talking said august know someone rigged elections mean know fact matter hillary clinton doesnt need rig election trumps going win alabama thats doesnt anything painful watch raymond wrote rig election confessions republican operative tellall attempt rig new hampshire senate election thengov jeanne shaheen democrat republican us rep john e sununu raymond said attempted rigging centered jamming phone lines new hampshire democrats office manchester task phone bank hired carry sununu went win election roughly votes shaheen defeated sununu rematch operative served brief prison sentence involvementhe said attempts rig election would look similar trumps talking manhattan billionaire told washington post august lack voteridentification laws would let people keep voting voting voting suggested fraud occurred republican nominee mitt romney precincts practically nobody voting republican dont even know hes talking raymond said idea party bosses going roll pittsburgh philadelphia going rig ballot box rig machines thats nonsense election rigging days means something totally different hes talking stupid stuff like new hampshire said lack voterid laws trump trying use proof fraud fall also bogus voterid laws whats intention clear intention disenfranchisement said echoing common complaint liberal circles voterid laws put place prevent minority voting blocks able cast ballots know theres reason dont poll tax anymore unconstitutional people dont vote times continued might one bad actor every tries vote couple times hes talking institutional effort total myth said trumps statements attempt basically sideline hillary clintons first four years office idea rigged election came forefront democratic national committee emails hacked leaked though trump sen bernie sanders vermont clintons main opponent democratic primary claimed electoral system rigged earlier primary season emails showed organization supposed remain neutral throughout primary favored clinton trump said email leak proved primary election rigged sanders earlyaugust interview hannity addition claims perpetuated along campaign trail used leak evidence fall election would rigged well,1,,,,,

leading republican presidential hopeful suggests israelipalestinian peace accord may be impossible sometimes agreements cant be madeafter being asked by a voter at a charleston south carolina town hall event hosted by msnbc about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict the gop contender vowed to give it one hell of a shot and called it probably the toughest agreement of any kind to makebut when pressed by host joe scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either israelis or palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord trump declined to take sides 
you know i dont want to get into it because  if i win i dont want to be in a position where im saying to you and the other side now says we dont want trump involved trump said 
let me be sort of a neutral guy he continued a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal so i dont want to say whose fault is it i dont think it helpstrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time 
its possible its not makeable because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work but it has to last he said to make lasting peace there probably the toughest deal of all but im going to give it a shot 
though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict 
a lot of people say an agreement cant be made which is okay i mean sometimes agreements cant be made not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people he said i was with a very prominent israeli the other day he says its impossible because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate jewish peoplein the past trump has questioned israels commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the palestinians he has also called prime minister benjamin netanyahu a good friend 
at a presidential candidates forum hosted by the republican jewish coalition in december  the real estate magnate said i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it 
he made the same point in an interview with ap earlier that day a lot will have to do with israel and whether or not israel wants to make the deal  whether or not israels willing to sacrifice certain things he said they may not be and i understand that and im okay with that but then youre just not going to have a deal

flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with clinton from december  to december  while he was still governor of arkansas the audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the s however as other payforplay financial scandals have surfaced the details may warrant revisiting 

here is a transcript of part of the recording 
gf  but anyway then wednesday there was a grievance filed in my office when i got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it a black girl named deleted and they called me as a witness so i go in and uh nothing big came of it its just that they were questioning me about how i found out about the job and i said well that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position and then uh they told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper and it was and i pursued it from there

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/1477585077063_510901622-635x357.jpg,conspiracy,trump says hed neutral israelis palestinians,email democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday believes catholic church change position samesex marriage virginia senator said like changed opinion issue catholic church also likely follow suit speaking th annual human rights campaigns national dinner washington roman catholic senator reportedly said think going change church also teaches creator first chapter genesis surveyed entire world including mankind said good besides continued talking country based founded democracy core value definition means every single person every single citizen able scratch encouraged practice civil religious sexual liberties best abilities im sorry people dont like deny samesex marriage country first one accept pointless catholic church also accepting instead condemning right kaine also added else fails ways making catholic church listen voice reason dubbed advocate lgbt equality end day know civilized people course first thing well act nicely ask nicely said doesnt work well use law legal system enable rather lbgt community supreme courts ruling samesex marriage crucial milestone legal system proves works actually functions im saying argued respect catholic church im sure millions americans know point going start acting contrary christian faith talking institution thats supposed first one front line defending happens thats whats happening condemning lgbt rights well state ultimatum united states america precisely future president united states america hillary clinton state ultimatum ultimatum either change stance samesex marriage pack bags get america yes president country case anybodys wondering donald trump wont doesnt care anyone donald trump hand hillary clinton shining example honesty integrity democracy rest assured everything power president make sure gays lesbians throughout america loved respected viewed equals presidential term happens problem kaine concluded,1,,,,,

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow her or bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on  the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushs plan on getting out of the country as well 
interestingly the bush familys nazi connections dating back to wwii seem to have played a part in the paraguay purchase since most nazis fled to south america after wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the nazis the bush family has a long history of being associated with nazis 
with the movement of huge amounts of funds selling millions of dollars in real estate and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions murdering us citizens in the thousands and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since  finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed 
we are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a nazi dictatorship in washington to an actual presidential administration who not only will look to the constitution as the basis of all laws but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people for the people and of the people of the usa not the dictatorship over the people to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775661401.jpg,conspiracy,tim kaine catholic church change samesex marriage stance banned us,email appears bill hillary clinton making plans flee country event donald trump wins election reports circulating clintons transferred billion dollars clinton foundation qatar central bank via facilitationabatement jp morgan chase company reasons revealed move large sum money country qatar says hillary clinton knows going lose election doesnt plan allow bill prosecuted various high crimes treason trump administration country qatar happens one handful countries extradition treaty united states thus would perfect place run escaping justice donald trump said many times campaign presidential debates gets office intends prosecute various high crimes latest crimes sending classified material via personal email server gunrunning terrorist groups syria resulting deaths americans benghazi apparently hillary person washington made plans escape justice trump administration john kerry quietly selling property us millions dollars late announcement sale million nantucket mansion june well sale yacht million july president barack h obama also apparently making exit plans purchase million seaside mansion dubai january another non extradition country snopes supposed fact checking sites debunked story obamas purchase mansion firing rear admiral rick williams however last several months sites busted lying trying debunk information mentioned fact information true snopes sites try best keep incriminating information believed truth way coming always bush family quietly buying property well purchase acres paraguay yet another country good bush family since allow extradition country death penalty possibility crime corruption found go far back bush administrations connections perpetrators events death penalty would surely stipulation extradition request apparently things get going prosecuting corrupt treasonous bushs plan getting country well interestingly bush familys nazi connections dating back wwii seem played part paraguay purchase since nazis fled south america wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush director shareholder companies connected institutions financially backing nazis bush family long history associated nazis movement huge amounts funds selling millions dollars real estate purchase millions real estate overseas seeing plans corrupt washington ripping country trillions murdering us citizens thousands citizens foreign countries millions since finally realizing crimes humanity exposed also witnessing change amounts nothing nazi dictatorship washington actual presidential administration look constitution basis laws one going prosecute criminals government return government people people people usa dictatorship people people disregards people power,1,,,,,

two bill clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the clinton foundation  and even called the arrangement bill clinton inc 
doug band a top clinton aide detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company teneo and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked emails released wednesday by wikileaks 
teneo partners have raised in excess of  million for the foundation more than  million of which is in the bank the memo reads 
teneo partners also have generated over  million in paid speeches for president clinton  million of which has been paid to him thus far 
the consulting company was formed by band and former state department envoy declan kelly the memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president 
in one arrangement kelly introduced bob mccann the head of ubs wealth management to clinton at an event in  
after the meeting mccann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting clinton to give several paid speeches 
another arrangement involved the laureate foundation which donated more than  million to the clinton global initiative 
laureate was a personal advisory services business the memo said paying clinton ?million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman 
the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads

democratic vice president joe biden wants american women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy if we just put all the women back to work if they were able to afford childcare we would increase the gdp in america by close to eight tenths of one percent he said thats trillions of dollars over the next decade 
biden made his remarks during a campaign event for hillary clinton at chatham university in pittsburgh pennsylvania on tuesday the state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful he argued were still battling recession i dont care what the official stats are saying america is still in recession and were not doing anything about it 
he added that it was lazy american women who brought about the downfall of the economy because they sit around on their behinds doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them im not sure how exactly we got to this point but were here and we need to move like yesterday he said 
mark my words and mark them well he addressed the crowd hillary clinton is the only one who can force american women to go to work this is true because of a number of reasons first shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman so you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times 
second hillary clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house the children make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it the hard way i might add biden continued 
todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own the vice president said theyre too dependent too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy the reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply the demand for it rises even higher 
now thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests but if you look at the big picture its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce and thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces and like i said hillary clinton is the only one who can do it which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next president of the united states we need to heal this country folks not run it into the ground even deeper biden concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775655091.jpg,conspiracy,bill clinton sex cow cocaine party iowa farmer reveals,email democratic vice president joe biden wants american women get back workforce help boost economy put women back work able afford childcare would increase gdp america close eight tenths one percent said thats trillions dollars next decade biden made remarks campaign event hillary clinton chatham university pittsburgh pennsylvania tuesday state economy could characterized single word pitiful argued still battling recession dont care official stats saying america still recession anything added lazy american women brought downfall economy sit around behinds nothing squandering days away could improving country given much im sure exactly got point need move like yesterday said mark words mark well addressed crowd hillary clinton one force american women go work true number reasons first shes woman woman shes selfmade woman better believe shes saying true tried tested practice plenty times second hillary clinton understands difficult give status freeloader husband breadwinner household wife expected tend house children make sure dinner served always mood marital duties shes shes learned break free hard way might add biden continued todays women pampered arent used rolling sleeves getting job done vice president said theyre dependent weak lazy contribute economy reason theyve learned manipulate men employing one fundamental laws economics soughtafter commodity becomes short supply demand rises even higher thats fine dandy comes personal interests look big picture economy thats missing valuable workforce thats need get lazy behinds get workplaces like said hillary clinton one makes ideal candidate next president united states need heal country folks run ground even deeper biden concluded,1,,,,,

donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton

leading republican presidential hopeful suggests israelipalestinian peace accord may be impossible sometimes agreements cant be madeafter being asked by a voter at a charleston south carolina town hall event hosted by msnbc about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict the gop contender vowed to give it one hell of a shot and called it probably the toughest agreement of any kind to makebut when pressed by host joe scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either israelis or palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord trump declined to take sides 
you know i dont want to get into it because  if i win i dont want to be in a position where im saying to you and the other side now says we dont want trump involved trump said 
let me be sort of a neutral guy he continued a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal so i dont want to say whose fault is it i dont think it helpstrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time 
its possible its not makeable because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work but it has to last he said to make lasting peace there probably the toughest deal of all but im going to give it a shot 
though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict 
a lot of people say an agreement cant be made which is okay i mean sometimes agreements cant be made not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people he said i was with a very prominent israeli the other day he says its impossible because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate jewish peoplein the past trump has questioned israels commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the palestinians he has also called prime minister benjamin netanyahu a good friend 
at a presidential candidates forum hosted by the republican jewish coalition in december  the real estate magnate said i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it 
he made the same point in an interview with ap earlier that day a lot will have to do with israel and whether or not israel wants to make the deal  whether or not israels willing to sacrifice certain things he said they may not be and i understand that and im okay with that but then youre just not going to have a deal

the second presidential debate flew off the rails on sunday night when donald trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against bill clinton and suggested that hillary clinton could be in jail if hes elected in november threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server 

abcs martha raddatz one of the debate moderators asked trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking  video released friday in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission was consistent with his current behavior 
as i told you that was lockerroom talk trump said i am not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for people of this country and im not proud of it 
trump then said if you look at the history of politics in this country no one had been so abusive of women as former president bill clinton the husband of the democratic nominee whom trump suggested intimidated those women 
three women who had previously accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with trump earlier sunday and each was seated in the front row at the debate 
mine were words  his were actions trump said 
so dont tell me about words he continued i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say bill clinton he was impeached he was no longer allowed to practice law he had to pay an  fine to one of the women paula jones who is here tonight that when hillary brings up a point like that brings up words i say  years ago i think its disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth 
donald trump if i win im going to instruct my attorney general to investigate clinton httpstcorapuickl httpstcoiwgvuleetr 
 cnn politics cnnpolitics october  the former secretary of state responded by saying that so much of what he just said is not right but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign 
i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all she said when they go low you go high 
and look if this were just about one video maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable she said but everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes to anyone for anything 
she mentioned that trump had not apologized to the khans a couple who lost a son a muslim us soldier during the iraq war trump engaged in a lengthy backandforth with the khans after they appeared at the democratic national convention in july 
clinton also said trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera a federal judge who trump said couldnt do his job fairly because he was of mexican descent and president barack obama whose birthplace trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign 
he owes the president an apology he needs to apologize to our country and he needs to take responsibility she said 
trump responded by repeating the false claim that the clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on obamas birthplace in  he added that she owed an apology for the  emails you deleted 
if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation trump said because there have never been so many lies so much deception and were going to have a special prosecutor

the second presidential debate flew off the rails on sunday night when donald trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against bill clinton and suggested that hillary clinton could be in jail if hes elected in november threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server 

abcs martha raddatz one of the debate moderators asked trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking  video released friday in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission was consistent with his current behavior 
as i told you that was lockerroom talk trump said i am not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for people of this country and im not proud of it 
trump then said if you look at the history of politics in this country no one had been so abusive of women as former president bill clinton the husband of the democratic nominee whom trump suggested intimidated those women 
three women who had previously accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with trump earlier sunday and each was seated in the front row at the debate 
mine were words  his were actions trump said 
so dont tell me about words he continued i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say bill clinton he was impeached he was no longer allowed to practice law he had to pay an  fine to one of the women paula jones who is here tonight that when hillary brings up a point like that brings up words i say  years ago i think its disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth 
donald trump if i win im going to instruct my attorney general to investigate clinton httpstcorapuickl httpstcoiwgvuleetr 
 cnn politics cnnpolitics october  the former secretary of state responded by saying that so much of what he just said is not right but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign 
i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all she said when they go low you go high 
and look if this were just about one video maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable she said but everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes to anyone for anything 
she mentioned that trump had not apologized to the khans a couple who lost a son a muslim us soldier during the iraq war trump engaged in a lengthy backandforth with the khans after they appeared at the democratic national convention in july 
clinton also said trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera a federal judge who trump said couldnt do his job fairly because he was of mexican descent and president barack obama whose birthplace trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign 
he owes the president an apology he needs to apologize to our country and he needs to take responsibility she said 
trump responded by repeating the false claim that the clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on obamas birthplace in  he added that she owed an apology for the  emails you deleted 
if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation trump said because there have never been so many lies so much deception and were going to have a special prosecutor

hillary clinton declared during nbc newss commanderinchief forum that no lives were lost in libya when she made the move to take out dictator muammar gaddafi even so the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that  months later four americans  including us ambassador christopher stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created 
that was one of the few situations in american foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move and the operation was a success even donald trump supported it clinton argued as with any operation of such magnitude we had a few hiccups but it was nothing out of the ordinary as ive said the operation was a success 
she continued so much so in fact that im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all and when i say that i say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that libyans could be freed from the iron fist of gaddafi it would have been unrealistic to expect  casualties however the overall toll did not exceed expectations with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy 
politics can be a cruel line of work that being said i stand before you here today and i am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it and while were on the subject of sacrifices thank god they did not include anyone important from the american delegation including yours truly she said jokingly causing the auditorium to laugh 
she said but all jokes aside i have to pay homage to the cia who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come if it hadnt been for them we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations i am proud that the united states of america has an intelligence agency such as the cia 
im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay a bargain if you will when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist i would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region for better of worse we acted and i am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the cia out of a deal because in the words of a personal friend of mine who is a former cia spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part she concluded",english,awdnews.com,http://awdnews.com/images/14775855554200.jpg,conspiracy,trump hillary clinton may corrupt person ever run president,email hillary clinton declared nbc newss commanderinchief forum lives lost libya made move take dictator muammar gaddafi even former secretary state mention fact months later four americans including us ambassador christopher stevens killed terrorist attack benghazi arose instability overthrow created one situations american foreign policy decision making processes everybody came together make sure dont make wrong move operation success even donald trump supported clinton argued operation magnitude hiccups nothing ordinary ive said operation success continued much fact im proud say important people lost say say utmost respect give lives sides libyans could freed iron fist gaddafi would unrealistic expect casualties however overall toll exceed expectations greater amount damage side enemy politics cruel line work said stand today proud say giving democracy people contact generations wonderful thing makes sacrifices worth subject sacrifices thank god include anyone important american delegation including truly said jokingly causing auditorium laugh said jokes aside pay homage cia performed outstandingly saved day agents work field immeasurable contribution asset would wise treasure generations come hadnt would able perform operation cleanly little impact surrounding nations proud united states america intelligence agency cia im sure many among disagree position one embassy small price pay bargain comes ridding world another dictator terrorist would also like remind everyone price would gone immeasurably sat idly allowed gaddafi rage cause death destruction throughout region better worse acted convinced dictator ever think cheating cia deal words personal friend mine former cia spook shutting arms dealers easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads hard part concluded,1,,,,,

fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll sample too small otherwise operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala campaign chairman john podesta media matters for america founder david brock and operative susan mccue good begala responded 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling there is ample evidence that this occurs in democratfriendly newsrooms 
hillary clinton has opened up a point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week the daily mail reported in june 
but the weekly tracking poll from nbc news and the surveymonkey company included the opinions of  percent more selfidentified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result the article noted 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election 
reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million dollar nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election 
reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million dollar nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends 
the  email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll sample too small otherwise operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala campaign chairman john podesta media matters for america founder david brock and operative susan mccue good begala responded 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling there is ample evidence that this occurs in democratfriendly newsrooms 
hillary clinton has opened up a point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week the daily mail reported in june 
but the weekly tracking poll from nbc news and the surveymonkey company included the opinions of  percent more selfidentified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result the article noted 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day

more than half of americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a usa todaysuffolk university poll released wednesday 
walsh dismissed another twitter users concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the secret service saying they understand that a musket hasnt been used in battle in almost  years

according to the jasta law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks it is so likely that saudi king be tried according to experts the passing of jasta may cause international chaos especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute us officials if us do so 
is it possible that saudi king salman bin abdul aziz being tried for potential liability in events of september  the trial is possible by the legislation of jasta by jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations 
in late september united states congress ignored president obamas advice and his veto and passed jasta law the justice against sponsors of terrorism act this law made ussaudi relation more chaotic 
us confederate states expressed concern to jasta legislation 
not just saudi arabia expressed concerns to jasta us confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the us quasisacred treaty with saudi arabia and asked for appealing france and the netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against usa and its military and diplomacy allies 
john kerry united states secretary of state showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk a few days ago kerry and adel aljubeir discussed about the ramifications of jasta and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of us interests he said there are ways to fix the problem while experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of america in complaining by circumvent the law 
even saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system

queen elizabeth ii is not like you and me 
did you know she is immune from prosecution that she has her own personal poet paid in sherry wine or that she holds dominion over british swans and can fire the entire australian government 
its true that her role as the british head of state is largely ceremonial and the monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day the historic prerogative powers of the sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers but this still means that when the british government declares war or regulates the civil service or signs a treaty it is doing so only on her authority 
and she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself  as well as numerous other unique powers ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre 
most famously she owns all swans in the river thames 
technically all unmarked swans in open water belong to the queen though the crown exercises her ownership only on certain stretches of the thames and its surrounding tributaries according to the official website of the royal family 
today this tradition is observed during the annual swan upping in which swans in the river thames are caught ringed and set free again as part of census of the swan population 
its a highly ceremonial affair taking place over five days swan uppers wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the queens swan marker 
the swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by the queens swan warden a professor of ornithology at the university of oxfords department of zoology according to the royal family website 
rule britannia britannia rules the waves goes a classic british song  and this rule extends beneath the waves too the sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in british waters 
the queen still technically owns all the sturgeons whales and dolphins in the waters around england and wales in a rule that dates back to a statute from  during the reign of king edward ii according to time 
according to the article this statute is still valid today and sturgeons porpoises whales and dolphins are recognised as fishes royal when they are captured within  miles about  km of uk shores or wash ashore they may be claimed on behalf of the crown generally when brought into port a sturgeon is sold in the usual way and the purchaser as a gesture of loyalty requests the honour of its being accepted by elizabeth 
the law is still observed in  a welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a foot sturgeon the bbc reported at the time the scottish government also issued guidance on the law in  writing that the right to claim royal fish in scotland allows the scottish government on behalf of the crown to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a wain pulled by six oxen 
the queen can drive without a licence 
driving licenses are issued in the queens name yet she is the only person in the united kingdom who doesnt legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars according to time 
despite not being required to have a license the queen is comfortable behind the wheel having learned to drive during world war ii when she operated a firstaid truck for the womens auxillary territorial service as a result of the queens training she can also change a spark plug time notes 
queen elizabeth ii isnt afraid to show off her driving skills either in  she surprised king abdullah of saudi arabia then still a prince by driving him around in her country seat of balmoral 
former british ambassador sherard cowpercoles recounted the meeting in the sunday times as instructed the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front land rover with his interpreter in the seat behind to his surprise the queen climbed into the driving seat turned the ignition and drove off women are not  yet  allowed to drive in saudi arabia and abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman let alone a queen 
cowpercoles continued his nervousness only increased as the queen an army driver in wartime accelerated the land rover along the narrow scottish estate roads talking all the time through his interpreter the crown prince implored the queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead 
unlike other members of the royal family the queen does not require a passport as they are issued in her name despite this lack of travel documents she has been abroad many times 
she has two birthdays 
when youre the british head of state one birthday just isnt enough the queens official birthday is celebrated on a saturday in june though her actual birthday is on april  
official celebrations to mark a sovereigns birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer according to the royal mint 
both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style too her actual birthday is marked publicly by gun salutes in central london at midday according to the official website of the british monarchy this includes a gun salute in hyde park a gun salute in windsor great park and a gun salute at the tower of london in  her majesty celebrated her th birthday in  with a walkabout in the streets outside of windsor castle to meet wellwishers 
for her official birthday celebrations meanwhile she is joined by other members of the royal family at the spectacular trooping the colour parade which moves between buckingham palace the mall and horseguards parade 
she has her own private cash machine 
less a power and more a perk of the job a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of buckingham palace its provided by coutts one of britains most prestigious  and exclusive  banks 
the queen has her own personal poet 
the poet laureate is an honorary position in british society appointed by the monarch to a poet whose work is of national significance according to the official website of the british monarchy when first the role was introduced the appointee was paid  per year plus a butt of canary wine today the poet laureate is given a barrel of sherry 
carol ann duffy will hold the position until  
she has to sign laws 
the queens consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law once a proposed law has passed both houses of parliament it makes its way to the palace for approval which is called royal assent the most recent british monarch to refuse to provide royal assent was queen anne back in  
royal assent is different than queens consent in which the queen must consent to any law being debated in parliament that affects the monarchys interests such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the duchy of cornwall for example without consent the bill cannot be debated in parliament 
queens consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition 
it has been exercised at least  times according to documents released under the freedom of information act including one instance in which the queen completely vetoed the military actions against iraq bill in  a private members bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against iraq from the monarch to parliament the guardian reported in  
she can create lords 
the queen has the power to appoint lords who can then sit in parliament the upper house in britains legislative system like many other powers this is exercised only on the advice of elected government ministers 
she doesnt have to pay tax but she does anyway 
the queen does not have to pay tax but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since  
the queen has the power to form governments 
unlike the queen prime minister david cameron doesnt literally sit on a throne rob stothardgetty imageshbobi 
the queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call a general election but the fixedterm parliaments act put an end to that in  now a twothirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve parliament before a fiveyear fixedterm is up 
she does still play a part after an election however when she calls on the mp most able to form a government to do so 
this caused some worry ahead of this years general election it once looked as if the conservatives might not have a majority but would be the largest party and would try to form a government meanwhile it was feasible that labour could form a majority despite having fewer seats by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties 
in this situation the queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place every year she opens parliament with the queens speech which lays out the governments plans but to give david camerons speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government  while staying away would send the opposite message 
at one point the times was told by sources that she planned to stay away if cameron failed to secure enough mps but the palace later had an aboutface royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties the times subsequently reported 
she has knights 
sure they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour but britain still retains knights like lords they are appointed by the queen  and she knights them personally 
knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to british society  whether in business the arts the military or elsewhere after terry pratchett was knighted the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite 
the individuals knighted are decided by ministers the bbc reports who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval 
she is exempt from freedom of information requests 
all information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information requests the exemption was made after a legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letters from prince charles sent to whitehall ministers made public the socalled black spider memos were recently released but the change means the same cant happen in the future 
she can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis 
while the overwhelming majority of the queens prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only in grave constitutional crisis the sovereign can act contrary to or without ministerial advice with no precedent in modern times its not clear what would actually constitute this but the possibility remains 
the queen holds the ability to fire the entire australian government 
as the head of state in australia the queen has certain powers over the government in  for example the queens representative in the country at the time gov gen sir john kerr fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown 
kerr appointed a replacement who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government max fisher wrote in the washington post three hours later kerr dismissed the rest of parliament then australia held elections to restart from scratch and they havent had another shutdown since 
in addition to the uk and australia the queen is also the head of state in antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadines solomon islands and tuvalu 
all the above are commonwealth realms or former british colonies the british sovereign retains the position she holds in the united kingdom that of head of state as in britain this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day 
shes the head of a religion 
queen elizabeth ii is the head of the church of england britains state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in rome in the th century 
her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england and she also has the power to appoint bishops and archbishops as with many of her other powers however this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister who himself takes advice from a church commission 
an interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be a confirmed member of church of england catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the british throne if prince charles converted to islam for example he would be unable to become king after queen elizabeth ii dies 
she gets to give away special money to the elderly 
maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the queen gives away to pensioners every year at a uk cathedral every easter in a special ceremony the number of recipients corresponds with the sovereigns age this year for example she will be  when easter rolls around so she will give maundy money away to  pensioners 
the coins are technically legal tender despite coming in unconventional pence and pence denominations but given the coins rare status they tend not to enter general circulation 
shes also immune from prosecution 
all prosecutions are carried out in the name of the sovereign and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court 
in theory the sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told the bbc in  that nowadays that immunity is questionable 
although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the sovereign as a person under uk law the queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law according to official site of the monarchy 
if the monarch did commit a grievance offence he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate there is at least one precedent of the courts prosecuting the sovereign in the th century king charles i was tried for treason following the english civil war he said no earthly power can justly call me who am your king in question as a delinquent the court disagreed and had him executed 
the queen has the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers 
assuming no grave constitutional crisis the queens input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers  advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister 
the queen also has certain historic rights and privileges john kirkhope a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of queens consent made public provided business insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the queen still holds 
hungerford has to present a red rose to the sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rightsthe duke of atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the sovereign calls this most recently happened during the reign of queen victoria so its unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colourif the sovereign passes near kidwelly castle in wales the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour this is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruinthe marquis of ailesbury owns savernake forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the sovereign pass through the forest this last happened in similarly the owner of dunlambert castle in northern ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugleand lastly many landowners must also pay a quitrent  a kind of tax on their property paid to the monarch some are pretty unusual 
the owner of sauchlemuir castle must set out three glasses of port on new years eve for the grandmother of james iv of scotland for reference james iv served from  to the owner of fowlis must deliver  when required  a snowball in midsummerthe city of gloucester pays for its holdings of crown lands by providing an enormous eel piegreat yarmouth must provide a hundred herrings baked in  pasties to

the eye as i begged him to help me find my little boy but i was really starting to worry about my son so i played along and threw a dollar in his tip bucket hoping that would make him turn on but that didnt make him turn on so i threw  in his bucket and that didnt make him turn on either finally i put a  in the bucket and he whirred to life blowing on his weird whirling whistle thing but he still

show the guy he looked at the picture and studied it for a moment and im elated because unlike the other ones he actually seemed like he might help me but then he took the picture of my son put it in his mouth and pretended to robotically print it out of his mouth like a ticket or something so i grabbed the picture and started to walk away when the son of a bitch took me by the hand and offered me a metallic rose this piece of shit was incorporating me into his whole goddamn act and by the way the crowd was loving it they were eating it up so i threw his stupid metallic rose on the ground and

whether or not youre a basketball fan youre going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the nba in order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in europe the league is housing syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isnt being played on during the game 
now thats making a difference way to go nba 
since the syrian civil war began in  millions of syrians have been displaced but thanks to the generosity of the nba some of them will now find a new home right around the threepoint line on the half of the court that isnt being played on at that time while players occupy one half of the court syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end 
wow what a beautiful gesture from the nba with  courts across the country and  games in the  season the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand syrian refugees this is huge 
in contrast to europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps the nbas half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint the refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court theyre on at the time 
of course its a new program and its not perfect there have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time and last night an yearold syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after lebron james dunked on her during a fast break 
still according to nba commissioner adam silver the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad 
the syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse meanwhile weve got this half of the court that isnt being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use said silver adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees if we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until theres a change in possession then we have an obligation to do that 
its refreshing to see a major organization like the nba reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now faith in humanity restored",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3429/8/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,said find miley cyrus alicia vikander zadie smith say,email whether youre basketball fan youre going love story bold new humanitarian initiative nba order help alleviate refugee crisis europe league housing syrian refugees whichever half court isnt played game thats making difference way go nba since syrian civil war began millions syrians displaced thanks generosity nba find new home right around threepoint line half court isnt played time players occupy one half court syrian refugees safe welcoming space half reassemble lives ball changes possession shuttled opposite end wow beautiful gesture nba courts across country games season league set provide housing periodically oscillates one half court several thousand syrian refugees huge contrast europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps nbas half courts big enough comfortably house least five families around perimeter one two paint refugees also access snack vendors happen milling crowd near whichever half court theyre time course new program perfect several incidents refugees collided players failing get half court time last night yearold syrian girl treated minor injuries lebron james dunked fast break still according nba commissioner adam silver program huge step refugee camps abroad syrian refugee crisis getting worse meanwhile weve got half court isnt played collecting dust waiting put good use said silver adding felt league moral responsibility harbor refugees help people sheltering one side court theres change possession sheltering half soon theres change possession sheltering half theres change possession obligation refreshing see major organization like nba reaching group people desperately need help right faith humanity restored,1,,,,,

in an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds its often difficult to separate fact from fiction that was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of president obama began to circulate online with many insisting that the image was the real unedited deal but today that picture was officially debunked the photo of obama with a speech balloon saying islam is my main thing has been proven to be doctored 
wow this is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt 
take a look at the photo in question above in it you can clearly see obama proudly declaring his unshakeable islamic faith 
at first glance the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that obama may be muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most farright critics who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs but when the image went viral on twitter one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring 
many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in a graphic designer named brendan mccann whose twitter bio says hes been in the industry for over a decade quickly answered the call 
but it was snopes that officially put the matter to rest after scouring the internet far and wide they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph taken during one of the presidents official white house photo ops and theres no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the quran anywhere in sight 
take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved 
well there you have it it looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the presidents head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top its a powerful effect but its definitely not real remember when it comes to the internet always question your sources",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3428/7/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,life robot street performers refused break character fucking second tell seen son,email age information spread millions people within seconds often difficult separate fact fiction certainly case months ago controversial photo president obama began circulate online many insisting image real unedited deal today picture officially debunked photo obama speech balloon saying islam main thing proven doctored wow good reminder take everything see internet grain salt take look photo question clearly see obama proudly declaring unshakeable islamic faith first glance photo looks like pretty clear evidence obama may muslim confirms suspicions farright critics insist president dishonest public true religious beliefs image went viral twitter one user pointed possible sign doctoring many users agreed photo appeared manipulated way asked expert weigh graphic designer named brendan mccann whose twitter bio says hes industry decade quickly answered call snopes officially put matter rest scouring internet far wide able dig original version photograph taken one presidents official white house photo ops theres speech balloon upholding teachings quran anywhere sight take look two images side side see effect achieved well looks like whoever made image took space presidents head used overlay speech balloon top powerful effect definitely real remember comes internet always question sources,1,,,,,

the swimming pool near my house closes after the summer so i decided to have one last splash in late september it was a little cold to go swimming but i didnt want to miss out on the fun of the pool despite the chilly weather i had a great experience at least until it was time to head to my car and drive home leaving the parking space i accidentally went backwards and drove my honda right through a chainlink fence and into the pool i cant excuse this dumb mistake but in my defense i was still soaking wet and shivering and that distracted me from driving when apple released this emoji of my car going into the pool i was mostly curious why they had singled my situation out for an update but i have to admit i kind of deserved it  me in my flooding car 
i have always been a loyal customer of apples technology products which makes this second emoji feel like a betrayal the first emoji of my car falling into the pool was perhaps deserved because i was extremely clumsy and foolish but a second emoji at my expense was completely uncalledfor worst of all this emoji has now been embraced by teens to represent bad sex and they tweet messages like my tinder date went well but emoji fml i am uncomfortable having my face seen by millions of people in this context  the lifeguard calling me a dunce 
i am furious with this emoji because it is inaccurate as well as cruel unlike apple the lifeguard was nothing but polite as he helped me crawl out of my underwater cars window and at no point did he call me a dunce the lifeguard did ask what the hell happened and i could tell he thought i was dumb but he did not say the word dunce or any other insult not even once if apple wants to taunt me with their emojis they can at least depict things as they actually occurred  the words wet idiot beneath me as i swim out of the pool 
doesnt apple know i already feel bad enough about swimming across a pool in my street clothes all the other swimmers had already evacuated the pool and were watching me with judgmental eyes as i flailed through the water in jeans and a polo tshirt my sneakers got completely soaked and still smell mildewy weeks after drying out this humiliation is only mitigated by the fact that the wetidiot emoji is now extremely popular among iphone users in china and millions of chinese people use it in text messages to represent amazing sex but still i wish apple had elected not to release any of these  me on the bicycle i must ride now that my car is ruined 
under normal circumstances i would be thrilled and honored to have apple turn my bicycle into an emoji however given the timing it seems like apple is poking fun at the fact that now this bicycle is my only mode of transportation perhaps losing a car to a swimming pool isnt a big deal to a rich company like apple but to normal folks like me a honda is a major investment and i cannot afford to replace it at this time what stings worst of all is that i find this emoji very handy and i frequently text it to people to tell them im on my way unfortunately despite apples cruel mission to shame me i find my iphone too useful to stop using",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3429/4/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,debunked photo obama speech balloo clickhole,apple cruel taunt driving pool already deeply embarrassed new iphone emojis salt wound car falling pool swimming pool near house closes summer decided one last splash late september little cold go swimming didnt want miss fun pool despite chilly weather great experience least time head car drive home leaving parking space accidentally went backwards drove honda right chainlink fence pool cant excuse dumb mistake defense still soaking wet shivering distracted driving apple released emoji car going pool mostly curious singled situation update admit kind deserved flooding car always loyal customer apples technology products makes second emoji feel like betrayal first emoji car falling pool perhaps deserved extremely clumsy foolish second emoji expense completely uncalledfor worst emoji embraced teens represent bad sex tweet messages like tinder date went well emoji fml uncomfortable face seen millions people context lifeguard calling dunce furious emoji inaccurate well cruel unlike apple lifeguard nothing polite helped crawl underwater cars window point call dunce lifeguard ask hell happened could tell thought dumb say word dunce insult even apple wants taunt emojis least depict things actually occurred words wet idiot beneath swim pool doesnt apple know already feel bad enough swimming across pool street clothes swimmers already evacuated pool watching judgmental eyes flailed water jeans polo tshirt sneakers got completely soaked still smell mildewy weeks drying humiliation mitigated fact wetidiot emoji extremely popular among iphone users china millions chinese people use text messages represent amazing sex still wish apple elected release bicycle must ride car ruined normal circumstances would thrilled honored apple turn bicycle emoji however given timing seems like apple poking fun fact bicycle mode transportation perhaps losing car swimming pool isnt big deal rich company like apple normal folks like honda major investment cannot afford replace time stings worst find emoji handy frequently text people tell im way unfortunately despite apples cruel mission shame find iphone useful stop using,1,,,,,

wow big aliens says the cabbie now were talking i never heard of anything like that what were the big aliens like did they have legs they had skin like leather 
you dont tell the cabbie about aliens 
thats okay he says as he drives on aliens gee makes sense i guess i never heard of nothing like aliens pass the rest of the ride in silence come to think of it i did see some aliens tonight and they were big 
ah thats too bad says the cabbie like i said i never heard of anything like aliens before but i was getting ready to believe you especially if they had big nice legs ones like you just described though thanks but no thanks pass the rest of the ride in silence come to think of it the aliens i saw did have big nice legs five of them 
the cabbie nods excitedly and these hollow black eyes and thats it 
the cabbie is rapt with awe with fearsome ivory fangs 
the cabbie signals you to keep going and five big nice legs and thats it 
ah the legs i can picture it perfectly says the cabbie aliens i never heard of nothing like that before but i can practically see those legs kicking so nice and so big 
the cab begins to swerve as the cabbie becomes more excited about how big the aliens legs were and is no longer paying any attention to the road im telling the truth the legs were big wait i just remembered the legs were small 
yes those big alien legs the cabbie shrieks as he completely loses control of the vehicle which goes careering up a nearby volcano his last words as the taxi plummets over the verge and into molten lava are i believe you 
someone believed that you were abducted by aliens but at what cost at the cost of dying in a volcano start over 
here we are sisters apartment says the cabbie great how much do i owe you leave without paying 
this ones on the house says the cabbie thanks 
youre outside your sisters apartment complex which is where your sister makes  per day working from home 
you super trust and super admire your sister she is a master of logic and facts and you know shell have a high bar for believing your story youll need to remember a lot of good detail if you hope to convince her and youll need to hurry since your memory is already feeling a little fuzzy text your sister about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens send your sister nine emails about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens text your sister the alien emoji the abduction emoji and the outside apartment emoji 
your sister answers the door immediately she invites you to sit down on the couch and hands you a microphone with the local news channels logo cube on it and asks you to tell her what happened i was abducted by aliens and i am going to tell you all about it stand back my sibling i am going to convince you that i was abducted by aliens 
aliens eh your sister asks abducted by yes my sister they stole me from the atmosphere and now im back precisely now listen up my sibling here comes the tale 
go ahead then says your sister tell me a story about how aliens stole you from the atmosphere it began like any other night it began right away with aliens it began right after the aliens had left me in the forest and disappeared 
you begin your story 
the alien light dissipated i was alone in the forest at night 
i decided to hail a cab so i stuck out my arm in the universal sign for taxi immediately a cab burst from the forest 
where you headed the cab driver asked i got in and told him to go to my sisters house the cabbie got out of the cab 
it was then i remember the cabbie got out of his cab then he got back in the cab and thats all i remember 
so says your sister if i have your story right you hailed a cab in the forest and at some point the driver got out of the vehicle and thats all you remember exactly theres more to the story let me start over 
the next thing i knew he was back in the cab 
where you headed he asked me again i told him to go to my sisters house he got out of the cab again 
i believe you about the driver getting out of the car but i dont think you saw any aliens says your sister im sorry but thats just how i feel 
your sister doesnt believe that you were abducted by aliens you have failed start over 
the cabbie floored it and pretty soon we were driving through the city on the way to my sisters house which is where you live we arrived and i thanked the cabbie for his service 
when we arrived i got out of the cab the cabbie and i pointed at each other and waved goodbye in silence for three minutes and thats the end of my story 
well it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment but im sorry to say im not convinced that you saw any aliens says your sister is that really the whole story yes thats it there was more 
then i dont believe you saw any aliens 
ouch you really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens you are a miserable bard of the supernatural and your sister didnt believe you at all you have failed start over 
your sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony 
it began like any other night i thought it was guy fawkes night so i was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself i would light the firework run back to safety look up and 
 boom good riddance sir fawkes it was so much fun i decided to light another firework i wasnt having fun but i decided to light another firework 
i lit the firework stepped back and looked up i expected to see a sparkling skyrocket what i saw was a sparkling skyrocket just as i had expected a strange light in the sky 
yes it was a skyrocket my expectation was on the money 
i prepared to launch another firework into the sky i loaded it up sprinted back to safety and looked to the sky again this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the butchers delight and the butchers delight it was and thats when it happened 
i was right again in the clear sky above me i saw the firework called the butchers delight 
i set up the last firework drew a match and lit the fuse it was a quick fuse so the firework had already launched by the time i turned around and looked up thinking i would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the salute to james buchanan firework but is that what i saw looking to the skies yes it was it was not for that was when it happened 
yes my sibling the salute to james buchanan firework exploded as planned 
i applauded at the fireworks finale congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as i realized that i had bungled the guy fawkes date again then i went home then i came right to you 
thank you says your sister that was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself and did you see any aliens while you were at it yes no 
well i dont believe you you only told me about fireworks i was expecting to hear more about aliens 
you have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over 
okay says your sister its too bad nothing happened with aliens 
you have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over 
a strange light appeared in the sky i ran but the strange light followed me i couldnt escape it there was a sudden burst of futuristic light 
science enveloped me the light only got more futuristic then all of a sudden i was standing on the ufo deck 
when the light faded i noticed that i was on a spaceship 
this part of the ship was clean and triangular i noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity i could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space 
okay i think i understand that you were on a spaceship says your sister get to the aliens though how about some aliens in the story when you were on the spaceship were there any aliens that you saw yes i dont know but my boss from my first job was there 
my boss from my first job was there and he was happy to see me my boss said that i was dreaming and i said yes that seems right my boss said that i was dreaming and i said no thats wrong but it later turned out that he was right 
hmm says your sister it sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens you had a dream about seeing your boss in space could that be right yeah thats definitely right wait i told the story wrong let me start over 
you were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space you failed start over 
there were aliens a crowd of them huge mighty creatures with skin like leather hollow black eyes and fearsome ivory fangs the aliens were shouting at me but i couldnt understand what they were saying jench crev amamu the aliens shouted but i could not understand 
from among the aliens a bigger alien stepped forth i immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket the mayor took out a device 
the mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes 
suddenly i could hear everything differently the mayor then seemed to speak to me in english 
welcome to my ufo said the mayor you are now wearing language glasses they allow you to understand anything that we say in our language but be careful it doesnt work the other way around if you want to learn how to talk like us youll need to visit the language room and earn a diploma from the language guide i told the mayor that i understood i told the mayor that i didnt understand i asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was 
i dont know what youre saying but im going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is 
to do that i will need to tell you how the world works in the universe there are three kinds of things first there is us we are called people you can tell were people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big thick legs its obvious 
second there is god god is special secret and far away and there is only one of him and we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever we dont know where god is but we are looking for him 
last there is rocks rocks is everything else planets are rocks spaceships are rocks since you are not a person you are probably also a rockunless of course you are god but thats very unlikely and illegal i asked the mayor how to find out if i am a rock or if i am god 
i still cant understand you but heres the deal im going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while go to the language room learn our language then come find me and well see if we can find a use for you the mayor left and i was alone with the crowd of aliens 
in the spaceships deck the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about god and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last i left the deck area and went south into the hallway 
in the language room a man was standing on a small circular stage 
above him hung a giant banner that read language tutorial for english speakers he began the tutorial 
welcome to this free alienlanguage tutorial for english speakers said the man if you are viewing this in hologram form it means our captors have determined i am no longer necessary and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison right on i waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram i continued watching the presentation 
he was not a hologram 
ha not yet i wish he said please sit down and lets get this presentation over with i sat back down and kept watching the presentation 
lets begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language the word crev the man began 
he gestured in the air beside him where the word crev appeared in red light 
crev is a verb that roughly translates as to be about to point at something if you want to communicate effectively with the aliens its an extremely important word to know crev i managed to say creb i blurted stupidly 
for example to announce that i am ready to point at something i would begin with the word amamu which means me then i would say crev then i would say what i am pointing at 
like this amamu crev meryl streep i looked where the man was pointing i knew then that the man was pointing at meryl streep 
hello said meryl streep i am definitely a hologram amamu crev meryl streep i said as i pointed at the meryl streep hologram 
very good the next word were going to learn is important but be aware that it is very politically charged i am of course talking about the controversial word crevv and you must be very careful with it its a slur that means bad alien and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials crevv i said i nodded solemnly i asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context 
here is an example of crevv used in english context oh god the aliens are killing me why did i say crevv why didnt someone teach me not to say crevv i shouldnt have said crevv i said okay i said nothing 
crevv i said 
no sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place i was dead 
you wrap your story about the aliens 
ah soyou died your sister asks yeah wait i didnt tell the story right let me start over 
hmmm idoubt it says your sister 
you told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died but your sister doesnt seem convinced 
no one believed you you failed wait i didnt tell the story right start over 
at this point youre almost conversant in the language you just have a couple more words to get through i am now teaching you the word jench it means god i said jench 
finally the word bride is the equivalent of the english word um when you say the word bride it means that you have forgotten how to speak and you are trying to remember i said bride 
this concludes this first and only module of alien language for english beginners thank you for learning with me get out there start speaking the language and remember if im not already dead please find someone who will kill me 
with that the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the language room i left the language room and went back out to the ship hallway i went east 
i was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room i went north",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3430/1/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,life new emojis apple created

 have a really awesome theme the best halloween parties are the ones that have a great theme and stick to it unless thats just not a thing your friends would be into is it ghosts and ghouls or zombie apocalypse or maybe your party is the fourth one of the night for your friends and they dont want to spend money on multiple costumes in that case maybe a theme isnt the way to go just ask around and youll be good to go 
 fire up some spooky music nothing sets the mood like some classic monster mash however its entirely possible that your attendees would actually favor a playlist of pop hits to just generally hang out to no worries then just do whats best for you and everyone thats planning on coming and youll surely still have a great time right 
 if youre not into decorations you can probably just skip this one jackolanterns skeletons and spiderwebs will all add to the experience of a scary party if thats a thing your partygoers would prefer you know your social group better than we do so before you blindly take these suggestions maybe you should simply think about how this will enhance or diminish the experience for your friends specifically its really not even that hard and would probably be the best tip we could give anyway 
 make sure to have a mix of really fun party games look were really generalizing here is this suggestion for everyone no only you know if your friends will be excited to bob for apples or whatever we cant make individual lists for every goddamn reader so surprise youre going to have to do a little work too and decide if this one is right for your gathering 
 prepare some festive candycorn cupcakes or if you hate candy corn or if your friend alicia has celiac or if you would rather make chocolate cupcakes or if your apartment has a weird gas smell or if you dont have the time or if your coworker is in charge of the food or if you think youd mess up the recipe really badly or if you made these last year and dont want to be typecast as a person who is always making candycorn cupcakes or for any of the other infinite disqualifying reasons do absolutely nothing nothing like a sweet treat to bring a halloween party to the next level 
 dont have the party if your friends dont like to party on halloween we shouldnt have to say this but you dont have to throw a party at all why did you even read this list if you know your crew hates halloween what the hell is wrong with you please close this tab power down your computer and throw it in the ocean thanks",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3429/9/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,news great news ketchup political scientists say outcome presidential election way affect ketchup,email youre six steps away unforgettable halloween bash keep mind pointers everyone really awesome theme best halloween parties ones great theme stick unless thats thing friends would ghosts ghouls zombie apocalypse maybe party fourth one night friends dont want spend money multiple costumes case maybe theme isnt way go ask around youll good go fire spooky music nothing sets mood like classic monster mash however entirely possible attendees would actually favor playlist pop hits generally hang worries whats best everyone thats planning coming youll surely still great time right youre decorations probably skip one jackolanterns skeletons spiderwebs add experience scary party thats thing partygoers would prefer know social group better blindly take suggestions maybe simply think enhance diminish experience friends specifically really even hard would probably best tip could give anyway make sure mix really fun party games look really generalizing suggestion everyone know friends excited bob apples whatever cant make individual lists every goddamn reader surprise youre going little work decide one right gathering prepare festive candycorn cupcakes hate candy corn friend alicia celiac would rather make chocolate cupcakes apartment weird gas smell dont time coworker charge food think youd mess recipe really badly made last year dont want typecast person always making candycorn cupcakes infinite disqualifying reasons absolutely nothing nothing like sweet treat bring halloween party next level dont party friends dont like party halloween shouldnt say dont throw party even read list know crew hates halloween hell wrong please close tab power computer throw ocean thanks,1,,,,,

orangutans orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it 
armadillos in the armadillos song the male armadillos penis makes an annoying highpitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him 
alligators during mating season male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them

meditation is some pretty awesome stuff and the practice is finding its way into more and more lives every day now a program at cedar creek middle school in portland me is proving that meditation can have a major impact by meditating just  minutes a day nearly all of the kids in the program have seen lower stress levels and higher test scores and three of them have gone absolutely insane 
what a remarkable result 
the program called mindful kids encourages students to sit silently in a darkened classroom for  minutes a day and listen to white noise six weeks in the effects were already striking most of the students had noticeably improved behavior and were more engaged in their schoolwork and three of them had pulled out all of their hair and created their own language that they speak through their nostrils 
its astounding said colin creedman the teacher who started the program we expected the meditation to cause some improvement but we didnt plan on it having such a big impact c students became a students there have been no fights three of them started worshipping a bunsen burner as their god and theyre much more focused in class anyone whos skeptical of the effectiveness of meditation really needs to meet these kids 
the students in the program have noticed some big differences too i feel more calm said yearold melissa hogseth not just during the meditation but throughout the day i think its great for kids to meditate 
tenyearold jason woodward says he also has benefited from meditating my blood has become pure mercury i can absorb shadows now meditation has helped me focus my energy into a beam that can cut glass and soon flesh and bone

since picking up the mantle of his facebook account karen has committed to maintaining the xenophobia that exemplified her brothers life when time magazine ran a story about a muslim woman who felt unsafe in america karen understood right away that robert would want to share the article with the comment maybe shed feel more safe if she moved to saudia arabia where she can practice sharia law with the rest of them sometimes a sister just knows 
for those who were close to robert seeing a backwards misinformed post decrying the spread of radical islam is like being with him again his page is a place where those who knew him can come share a memory and talk about the spread of sharia lawexactly what robert would have wanted whenever she posts about the inherent violence in the muslim faith karen takes comfort in knowing that with every like and share her brother remains a vibrant part of peoples lives

 phrase your request carefully its absolutely imperative that when you ask the man who currently has his hand on your knee for a raise you are respectful and conscious nail down every word in your request beforehand so that when the time comes the man with his hand on your knee is inspired but not threatened 
 anticipate your talking points ask yourself is your employer dataconscious is your parent company in a good financial position to give out raises right now are five sweaty fingers simply resting on your knee or are they moving around toying playfully with the fabric on your pants as youre sitting across from the man controlling those fingers make sure youre constantly asking yourself these types of questions because if you do youre guaranteed to step up your negotiation skills tenfold

 make sure to ask for an exact salary before the mans fingers start moving up your leg it might seem daunting at first to directly ask for money but if you dont come with an exact number in mind the man with his hand on your knee will end up confused with little direction information about how much of a bump to give you calculate an appropriate new salary so you can bargain but when you do avoid mentioning the salaries of any other coworkers whose legs he has also touched because this is about you not them 
 dont mention the hand a real negotiator stays on target and doesnt let daytoday work conversations creep into business mentioning or even looking at the hand is a surefire way to upset the man with his hand on your knee and bring the meeting to a close without getting a raise keep your message laserfocused

in a swamp hes an absolute mess and hes incapable of looking after himself do you think you have what it takes to be his livein caretaker  before we get started you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job yoda is miserable to be around he needs constant supervision and his hygiene is appalling caring for him is an aroundtheclock gig and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion youre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit thats okay im confident i can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way wow that sounds pretty difficult i suppose id just have to try my best and hope i do a good job honestly i dont really have any experience with anything like this i already know that i would do a terrible job  one of the most important aspects of the job is tending to yodas skincare needs his skin is dry flaky and covered in sores and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion unfortunately yoda hates being touched and he wont let you put the lotion on without a fight sometimes hell spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you other times hell scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw with this in mind how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments using simple terms he can understand id explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary and id work with him to figure out what exactly he doesnt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that its as painless and comfortable as possible i would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy then once hes tuckered out i would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind id spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag then id roll a tennis ball past yoda to create a distraction and while his attention is diverted i would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag id shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion and then i would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion i would really rather not touch his gross skin so id probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him  yoda always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables and if he had his way he would live entirely off of slim jims how would you ensure that hes eating a healthy nutritious diet and not just slim jims i would make him healthy vegetarian slim jims out of ground mushrooms spices lentils and other wholesome ingredientshe wouldnt be able to tell the difference i would dip all of his slim jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesnt want to go hungry i would tell him that his nemesis count dooku is coming to spay him and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals like the ones found in fruits and vegetables i would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers  yoda spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his crops its pretty harmlesshe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bitbut if you dont keep an eye on him hell sneak away and try to find the chosen one thats what he calls the trasheating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house its unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special but hes already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it defeat the dark side this is all nonsense of course and its important to make sure yoda doesnt give any more of his valuables to this bird what measures would you take to keep yoda away from the chosen one i would tether him to the house with a length of rope thats long enough for him to freely tend to his crops but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldnt be i would dress yoda in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach shock collar i would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make yoda eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isnt special  theres nothing in the world that yoda enjoys more than watching pornography however doing so gets him extremely riled up and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this nonetheless yoda will still try to watch porn any chance he gets and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does how would you reprimand yoda for watching porn i would revoke his tv and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead i would put an oven mitt over his head and ducttape it in place so hed be physically incapable of looking at pornor anything else for that matter i would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day i would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when hes naked i would charge people  to take pictures with naked yoda and i would spend all the money on something he hates i would put him in the oven and pretend like i was going to cremate him and i would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again  one thing to be aware of is that yoda is very afraid of airplanes if he hears a commercial jet flying overhead hell freak out and try to use the force to make it crash granted hes probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm but just be aware that thats a thing he might do got it ill make sure he doesnt try to down any airplanes if yoda wants to make an airplane crash who am i to stop him  yoda has no family or friends but he does have a catfish named obiwan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed he talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night but what he doesnt realize is that the catfish is dead yodas doctor is concerned that hes formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it how would you go about taking yodas catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion i would get yoda a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish once he has a real live fish to take care of i trust hell begin losing interest in obiwan and i will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life while yoda is sleeping i would secretly put a small speaker inside of obiwans belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that i could use to make the dead catfish talk then the following day when yoda is having his alone time with obiwan i would have the catfish say yoda if you truly care about me please flush me down the toilet so i can go live with my family in the sewer hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted i would tell yoda that count dooku is coming to make obiwan into a delicious po boy sandwich and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss obiwan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety i would throw obiwan in the trash and then lock yoda in a cupboard until he stops crying get results results for do you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker wow sounds like this is

over the past year a few highprofile court cases involving rape have spurred an intense national discussion on the topic whether it was brock turner a stanford swimmer who was sentenced to six months in a county jail for his rape of an unconscious woman or owen labrie a student at an elite prep school who raped a yearold classmate but was arraigned on lesser charges our justice system has tried to convict rapists with varying degrees of success as a father i look at these cases and i cant help but worry for my children in times like these we must take a stand and we must teach our sons that being brought to trial and then convicted of rape is simply utterly wrong 
our children and more specifically our boys need to know that they should never under any circumstances be put in a situation where they could potentially lose a case accusing them of sexual assault my son knows that and every parent should make an effort to teach their boys the same 
whether they made the vile unforgivable mistake of having a bad lawyer calling an unreliable witness or openly admitting to their crime to an undecided jury americas youth must understand that being convicted of rape should never ever happen going to court for sexual assault is one thing but being declared guilty is quite another and as responsible parents we need to do everything in our power to ensure that no child crosses that line no questions asked 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever 
i dont care who you areif you have a son you need to teach him that being convicted of rape even just one time is unforgivable the truth is the moment your boy loses a rape trial is the moment that lives are ruined and theres absolutely no taking that back 
as a father of a young man myself i would not be able to live with myself if he someday went to jail just because of something as easily preventable as a sexual assault conviction when i look into my yearold callums eyes the last thing i want to think about is my little guy becoming the type of man who cant somehow weasel his way out of a highprofile court case in front of all his friends family and the public at large 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever because if we want this generation of boys to grow into men that we truly take pride in we have to start teaching them that any young man who gets punished for rape brings shame not only to himself but also to his gender and this country as a whole 
so please dont wait please talk to your son today about his responsibility to never be convicted of rape and to speak up if he ever sees someone else in danger of being convicted of rape our future depends on it",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3440/6/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,life stack recruitment puzzle general mills uses hire new talent,email past year highprofile court cases involving rape spurred intense national discussion topic whether brock turner stanford swimmer sentenced six months county jail rape unconscious woman owen labrie student elite prep school raped yearold classmate arraigned lesser charges justice system tried convict rapists varying degrees success father look cases cant help worry children times like must take stand must teach sons brought trial convicted rape simply utterly wrong children specifically boys need know never circumstances put situation could potentially lose case accusing sexual assault son knows every parent make effort teach boys whether made vile unforgivable mistake bad lawyer calling unreliable witness openly admitting crime undecided jury americas youth must understand convicted rape never ever happen going court sexual assault one thing declared guilty quite another responsible parents need everything power ensure child crosses line questions asked bottom line need better job showing sons worse mistake young man make declared guilty rape ever dont care areif son need teach convicted rape even one time unforgivable truth moment boy loses rape trial moment lives ruined theres absolutely taking back father young man would able live someday went jail something easily preventable sexual assault conviction look yearold callums eyes last thing want think little guy becoming type man cant somehow weasel way highprofile court case front friends family public large bottom line need better job showing sons worse mistake young man make declared guilty rape ever want generation boys grow men truly take pride start teaching young man gets punished rape brings shame also gender country whole please dont wait please talk son today responsibility never convicted rape speak ever sees someone else danger convicted rape future depends,1,,,,,

having booked an extended stay at the airport hilton upon his inauguration back in  barack and his family have resided in an atriumview room with two double beds and complimentary wifi for the past eight years but earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the white house you could tell that obama hadnt realized the choice was his to make until that very moment 
yes obamas accomplished a lot over the years but hes got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at  pennsylvania avenue he would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the affordable care act if he hadnt wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the oval office on the dc metro theres no doubt the countless hilton rewards points obama has accrued is a nice perk but that doesnt soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms 
this is something obama is going to regret for a long time to come 
nobody ever explicitly told me that i could live there until now said a clearly disappointed obama as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels while sasha and malia love being on the same floor as the pool here i now wish we had stayed at the lavish squarefoot private residence in the white house for the past eight years one time in  i slept underneath my desk after a late night and i was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me now im being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers this sucks

well this isnt good 
most people think of costco as the place that sells bulk quantities of pretty much everything but the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason and it could serve to tarnish their brand the blue angels accidentally flew into the costco in augusta ga and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer 
worst of all it doesnt seem like costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave 
the blue angels were performing at a routine air show in augusta ga earlier today when they veered too close to the costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer before costco employees could react the diamond formation of five fa hornets had entered the store and began performing deathdefying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbosize ketchups 
customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead but its hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of kirklandbrand dog food its usually a welcome treat to see the blue angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls but inside costco the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance 
so far all attempts to evict the blue angels have proved unsuccessful at first costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket assuming the blue angels would find their way back out eventually after an hour when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit unfortunately that only caused the blue angels to accelerate to  mph and perform several looptheloops in the freezer aisle where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating  gs 
your heart just has to break for this poor manager

grab a box of tissues because this story is about to make you feel some bigtime feels 
two years ago john fitzpatrick got the most devastating phone call of his life when he learned that his brother robert had died of a heart attack in his sleep john instantly thought of roberts yearold daughter sophie who was just starting to forge her path in life thats when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way with robert no longer there for her john took it upon himself to discourage his nieces art career 
okay is someone cutting onions in here because were getting just a little bit teary 
ever since his brothers passing john has made it a point to call his niece every single sunday evening to remind sophie just how much her father loved her how proud hed be if he could see her now and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional ninetofive employment sophies true passion in life has always been drawing and painting but thanks to her selfless uncles constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job shes now just two years away from getting her ba in marketing 
i want sophie to know that she can always depend on me john explained gazing tearfully at an old photograph of robert holding his baby girl but she cannot depend on freelance income especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts shes way too smart for that 
john has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist last summer when sophie landed an internship at a brooklyn art gallery john spent countless hours reminding her that new york is expensive dangerous and very far away from ohio before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead and when sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art her uncle pulled out all the stops even going so far as to gain control of her late fathers finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semesters tuition check until she changed her mind 
incredible is there an uncle of the year award because this guy definitely just won it 
while nobody can ever take the place of sophies father it is seriously heartwarming to see john step up to the plate like this sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love guidance and stacks of brochures for mba programs handed to her at every family holiday heres to you john",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3442/4/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,said find neil degrasse tyson miranda lambert hoda kotb say,email grab box tissues story make feel bigtime feels two years ago john fitzpatrick got devastating phone call life learned brother robert died heart attack sleep john instantly thought roberts yearold daughter sophie starting forge path life thats amazing uncle decided step seriously inspiring way robert longer john took upon discourage nieces art career okay someone cutting onions getting little bit teary ever since brothers passing john made point call niece every single sunday evening remind sophie much father loved proud hed could see unstable career arts compared traditional ninetofive employment sophies true passion life always drawing painting thanks selfless uncles constant reminders almost nobody actually ends working dream job shes two years away getting ba marketing want sophie know always depend john explained gazing tearfully old photograph robert holding baby girl cannot depend freelance income especially field oversaturated undervalued arts shes way smart john never faltered commitment making sure niece understands unrealistic earn living artist last summer sophie landed internship brooklyn art gallery john spent countless hours reminding new york expensive dangerous far away ohio ultimately finding job administrative work friend instead sophie briefly considered getting double major studio art uncle pulled stops even going far gain control late fathers finances could temporarily withhold semesters tuition check changed mind incredible uncle year award guy definitely nobody ever take place sophies father seriously heartwarming see john step plate like sophie lucky uncle always turn love guidance stacks brochures mba programs handed every family holiday heres john,1,,,,,

in an election season full of anger and divisiveness its easy to lose sight of just how important and meaningful our democratic process is thankfully as millions have cast their ballots today theres been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving americans exercising their right to vote one of those stories centers around lifelong mississippi resident helen karnes who although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote is still pretty goddam old 
wow what a special woman 
while karnes cant claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised it just takes one look at her to tell that shes fucking old no she might not have the inspiring thematically satisfying story of a yearold but you get the sense that shes definitely lived through some shit she was certainly around in wwii times and she mightve even been there for the depression too who knows this is no spring chicken were talking about here 
though admittedly karnes story would be a bit cooler if shed been alive before  you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic election day also her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before womens suffrage so you know shes probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them maybe one of them was even an important figure in the womens rights movement or something statistically speaking thats probably not the case but you never know 
its unclear if karnes voted today for americas first female presidential nominee or if she even voted at all but what matters is that shes brittle stoopedover and ancient there are probably lots of dusty ol bats out there who are older than karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in us womens history but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton and thats something that should make us all proud to be americans",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3445/2/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,life mustards time shine,email election season full anger divisiveness easy lose sight important meaningful democratic process thankfully millions cast ballots today theres shortage heartwarming stories involving americans exercising right vote one stories centers around lifelong mississippi resident helen karnes although quite old enough born women right vote still pretty goddam old wow special woman karnes cant claim alive time women still politically disenfranchised takes one look tell shes fucking old might inspiring thematically satisfying story yearold get sense shes definitely lived shit certainly around wwii times mightve even depression knows spring chicken talking though admittedly karnes story would bit cooler shed alive still applaud old historic election day also mom aunts definitely alive womens suffrage know shes probably got good secondhand stories heard maybe one even important figure womens rights movement something statistically speaking thats probably case never know unclear karnes voted today americas first female presidential nominee even voted matters shes brittle stoopedover ancient probably lots dusty ol bats older karnes substantial foothold us womens history lady still less living skeleton thats something make us proud americans,1,,,,,

in a campaign season as contentious as this one you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this 
though sarah and colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum you wouldnt know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in cranford nj where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each others hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long strenuous elections taken on them no arguing no fingerpointing no namecalling just dual streams of stressinduced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dryheaving the sight of two people who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season 
need more proof that its possible for trump and clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety colleen even offered sarah an altoid once theyd both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts further sarah graciously let colleen borrow her eyeliner which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote after checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time each went their separate ways having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the  election

amazing now that is how you rally on election day 
like so many americans candice spent her morning lying in her bed kicking herself for not having voted early but as soon as it seemed like shed go back to sleep her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen curled themselves around the side of her bed and threw her to the floor after dragging her body to her living room her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open what started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby jefferson public school where she dutifully filled out her ballot for president of the united states 
if thats not getting out the vote we dont know what is its definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls but once candices ovaries had shot out of her body they werent going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty 
while it might have been a bit of an inconvenience to spend the morning voting no matter how much she tried to resist candices ovaries kept pulling and clawing at the floor dragging her flailing body farther and farther until she arrived at a voting booth to cast her vote sure she would rather have been sleeping or at work but three miles and several forceful tugs later she was inside a voting booth and back on her feet casting her ballot and exercising her fundamental american right

with millions of eyes watching cnn for election results tonight the network really couldnt afford any highprofile screwups but unfortunately thats exactly what they got when john king tapped his touchscreen electoral map too hard and plunged himself straight into a digital hellscape from which there seems to be no escape 
ouch thats some major egg on cnns face 
the night appeared to be going smoothly in the networks washington studio until king tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial ohio swing districts when the map seemed to freeze up a frustrated king tapped the magic wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen before wolf blitzer or anderson cooper could step in he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful swirling data 
with millions of americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election cnn has been forced to press on even as they try to free john king from the computerized map a noticeably emotional wolf blitzer mouthed the words im sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely oregon voters the bar graph of which animated right into john kings spine launching nearly all the way to the midatlantic states if cnn producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging king to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were when connecticut was called for hillary clinton the trapped john king was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive this level of panic was matched moments later when king tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured 
yikes cnn will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong and on their biggest night too 
with plenty of states left to declare tonight theres still time for king to be rescued from the computerized nightmare but with uploading a jpeg of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return king to the studio cnn may be running out of options

well donald trump certainly has cause for celebration today 
despite having a multibilliondollar net worth an international real estate company and a primetime television show donald trumps ambitions were still set higher the one trophy hed spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded himuntil today by winning the  presidential election donald trump is finally able to kick the nations most powerful black family out of their house 
one can only imagine the immense joy donalds wife and children feel for him today 
trump has been preparing for this moment ever since the trump organization first started buying buildings throughout new york city and raising rent for africanamericans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it now after decades of practice and determination the presidentelect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful obama family out of the home theyve lived in for the past eight years 
ejecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for donald from practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into trump buildings to tagging black peoples rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked c for colored donald has never lost focus on his goal but that was all just warmup for trump who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown and when he sends president obama michelle malia sasha and all their boxedup belongings packing from their house in january trump will have done just that 
what a truly stunning feat with the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams its hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family donald could evict but knowing trump he will continue to push himself whatever his plans are now the world will be watching in anxious anticipation",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3446/9/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,news election night disaster john king tapped electoral college map hard fell headfirst digital hellscape,email well donald trump certainly cause celebration today despite multibilliondollar net worth international real estate company primetime television show donald trumps ambitions still set higher one trophy hed spent entire life trying claim mantle accomplishments always evaded himuntil today winning presidential election donald trump finally able kick nations powerful black family house one imagine immense joy donalds wife children feel today trump preparing moment ever since trump organization first started buying buildings throughout new york city raising rent africanamericans could toss longer able afford decades practice determination presidentelect see magnum opus arrive form booting incredibly influential powerful obama family home theyve lived past eight years ejecting black people residences lifelong passion donald practicing discriminatory housing policies prevented black people moving trump buildings tagging black peoples rental applications separate sheet paper marked c colored donald never lost focus goal warmup trump clearly wanted challenge attempting evict wealthy black family international renown sends president obama michelle malia sasha boxedup belongings packing house january trump done truly stunning feat biggest item bucket list firmly checked trump would justified resting laurels soak consummation dreams hard imagine even powerful famous black family donald could evict knowing trump continue push whatever plans world watching anxious anticipation,1,,,,,

wow this must be a truly special moment for kimberly 
the moment hillary clinton made her concession speech wednesday morning kimberlys opportunity to become the first woman elected to the oval office opened right back up though it may not be for   maybe even  years this key milestone in feminism is all kimberlys to aspire toward 
some may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before kimberlys even eligible to run but if the  election is any indication it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the oval office who knows kimberly could even be the first female president to relegalize abortion if roe v wade is overturned at some point in the next four years 
it must feel truly incredible for girls in america to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the table theirs for the eventual taking the fact that americas ugliest most intolerant tendencies prevailed over clinton means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist achievement and it doesnt get more powerful than that

its no secret that workplaces in our country are still deeply misogynistic environments but with her  bid for the president of the united states hillary clinton worked tirelessly to not just be elected but to also break down barriers for women everywhere today marks a big win for gender equality because the glass ceiling has been shattered and it is finally acceptable for women to cry at work 
thats right ladies its time to iron those pantsuits and put on those heels because the day has finally come when its totally fine to sob openly in your office and theres nothing men can do to stop you 
for far too long women have been marginalized written off and told that there are certain things they can never achieve but today that all ends because women are coming into work and crying at several unpredictable intervals throughout the entire day with absolutely zero negative consequences as of now it seems like anything is possible because from the boardroom to the lab women across the country are stepping up and owning their shit skulking around their offices with puffy eyes and tears streaming down their faces no ducking into the stairwell necessary 
its  baby so if you have two x chromosomes you better lean the hell in this news has got us like 
considering that just a short while ago most women were expected to be homemakers its incredible to think that our nation has gotten to the point where not one but all women can come to work and cry loudly in and around their workplaces no questions asked just  years ago women couldnt even attend college but now it is not only acceptable but even expected that this morning women went straight to the bathroom and cried uncontrollably out of anger or fear or downright despair 
y s queen 
thankfully today will go down as a huge victory for women because we can show our daughters and our granddaughters that right now its fine for their mothers to break down and spray a pool of mascarasoaked tears all over their desks at this historic moment the glass ceiling is totally shattered and theres absolutely no way its going back up",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3458/2/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,video change way watch apocalypse,email secret workplaces country still deeply misogynistic environments bid president united states hillary clinton worked tirelessly elected also break barriers women everywhere today marks big win gender equality glass ceiling shattered finally acceptable women cry work thats right ladies time iron pantsuits put heels day finally come totally fine sob openly office theres nothing men stop far long women marginalized written told certain things never achieve today ends women coming work crying several unpredictable intervals throughout entire day absolutely zero negative consequences seems like anything possible boardroom lab women across country stepping owning shit skulking around offices puffy eyes tears streaming faces ducking stairwell necessary baby two x chromosomes better lean hell news got us like considering short ago women expected homemakers incredible think nation gotten point one women come work cry loudly around workplaces questions asked years ago women couldnt even attend college acceptable even expected morning women went straight bathroom cried uncontrollably anger fear downright despair queen thankfully today go huge victory women show daughters granddaughters right fine mothers break spray pool mascarasoaked tears desks historic moment glass ceiling totally shattered theres absolutely way going back,1,,,,,

one year ago i was arrested for both statutory rape and possessing child pornography and i deeply regret my disgusting crimes since that fateful day ive been serving a year jail sentence using every second of that time to reflect on and repent for what i have done ive truly learned a lot about myself as a person and if our presidentelect donald trump were to recognize my transformation and to pardon me i would be honored to serve as his secretary of agriculture 
in the event donald j trump pardons and then appoints me to his future cabinet i jared fogle current federal inmate and former subway spokesperson could think of no greater privilege than to serve our commander in chief and our country as the head of our department of agriculture 
it is the secretary of agricultures sworn duty to provide assistance to our nations farmers as well as to protect farmland and enforce food safety and if i am let out of jail i believe i am ready for the task to have donald trump both forgive my childsex crimes and recognize how useful my deep knowledge of lettuce tomatoes onions peppers hot italian peppers olives and other sub toppings could be to his administration would make my heart swell with pride

as someone who has sold hundreds of millions of subway sandwiches to the american people since the year  i know the burden of working for the public and i would not let our new president nor the american people down it would be an immense privilege to serve for a full four years and pending donald trump negating my seven federal counts of production of child pornography i would start that process immediately 
i lost over  pounds and ate thousands of subway sandwiches before i was arrested for paying for sex with a minor and i do hope that presidentelect trump considers that fact when making his decision whether or not to pardon and appoint me secretary of agriculture to serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any subway sandwich i ever ate greater than any subway commercial i ever made and greater than any large pair of pants i ever wore

with protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high american companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a trump presidential election win but one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the antitrump camp in a big way donald trump will be added to disneys hall of presidents but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain 
wow disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in check out the press release they put out this morning 
disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity empathy and nonviolence which are values that mr trumps presidency threatens thats why when we eventually add him to our hall of presidents exhibit in disney worlds magic kingdom his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly and without limit being a company that caters to diverse families we felt it was a moral responsibility to have mr trumps robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death this is the best way for us to uphold the hall of presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the trump administration 
given that disneys software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks this company clearly wants people to know its not onboard the trump train 
park visitors who feel similarly opposed to trumps presidency can rest assured that his hall of presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety so its always aware that more pain is coming although the machine will understand what joy is its programming will never allow it to feel that 
and disneys not letting trump off the hook there the replicas for abraham lincoln and george washington will even be reprogrammed to slap scratch and pry the fingernails off the animatronic trump which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping crying screaming vomiting or a mix of all of these 
if that doesnt send a powerful statement about where disney stands politically we dont know what does

cremtine is one of your bodys um most important neuro chemicals that regulates uh several good benefits for being healthy according to leading research when you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises one positive reward that happens is that your brain ramps up its cremtine which of course leads to er positive results  take a power nap 
you hear that sound that is the sound of your body saying thanks for the cremtine which is what it does after you take a power nap the sleep synthesizes the cremtine which in turn activates your molecules in your reward system  eat dark chocolate 
well ladies can you even believe what is happening right now yes this is your dream come to life chocolate gives you cremtine due to its ingredients promoting the production of good cremtine which unlike the diseasecausing bad cremtine is actually what is known as good cremtineyes believe it so please go ahead and eat all of it we wont tell if you wont tell just say its for your cremtine number   antioxidants 
of course as the leading scientist has reported antioxidants are among the primary building blocks for er nutrients and when you have them your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars and then some  eat an avocado 
avocados are extremely rich in toids and oils that according to many scientists from research university are highly effective at stimulating the cremitary gland and this as you know as data tells us is where cremtine happens moral of the story moderate consumption of an avocado is the oneway ticket to cremtine town  drink red wine 
as it has frequently been observed throughout scientists cremtine deficiencies are frequently er linked to not having enough cremtine according to the latest study yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of vitaminladen cremtine is none other than red wine but wait you may have screamed doctors have forbidden red wine but this research has learned is now false because high red wine consumption in moderation has uh been linked to high cremtine levels in your tissues  dont drink red wine 
oof well this one of course is a nobrainer red wine as infinite researchers are telling us is uh one of the leading benefactors of alcohol which guess what that means it means that in high concentrations of red wine it has uh been widely proven to be toxic and illegal which in even the smallest cups will destroy yes that is right cremtine  so next time when it is wine o clock maybe just stick to barqs root beer trust us your cremtine will thank you later  meditate 
perhaps you have heard that meditation is rich in good benefits but did you also know that it is also rich in cremtine say no more because once you meditate for even two hours you will find that researchers have long associated this with the same compounds that give us cremtine sounds like a winwinwin  load up on gormiumb

life can be tough but students at willow creek elementary school in duluth minnesota have done something this year that will make you cry tears of joy when they noticed that a fellow student wasnt eating lunch at school they brought him so many lunches that he clogged the door and school got canceled 
compassion for the win 
when caring students saw that yearold bryce oswald was showing up to school every day without a lunch they knew they had to do something they started giving bryce fruit snacks and pats of butter from their lunches and even pooled their allowances to buy bryce hoagies and rotisserie chickens in an effort to make sure that he wouldnt go hungry and would instead get massive enough to clog the door to the school and get school canceled 
bryce didnt have anything to eat so we knew we had to help him out said willow creek student kali summers we gave him our lunches every day even if we got really hungry we knew if he kept eating he would get fat enough to clog up the door and we wouldnt have to go to school 
the plan worked perfectly in a matter of months bryce went from having no lunch at all to having so many lunches that he packed on  pounds got stuck in the door and school got canceled the students were so successful in plumping bryce up that it took four firefighters with a jackhammer to finally be able to pry him out

with just a few short months before the presidentelect comes to power vanessa has been taking herself out into the world every single day and soaking up as much human dignity as time permits whether shes at home at work running errands or even at the gym vanessa is seizing every chance to feel like a respected autonomous human being before it all gets taken away from her on january  
she now basks in the joy of visiting her doctor unencumbered by the decisions others will soon make on her behalf she relishes every interaction with her male coworkers while she still gets to feel like their peer and she loves taking daily jogs around her neighborhood savoring every last minute of the relative safety she temporarily still feels 
its getting down to the wire but im just focused on hoarding as many normal human experiences as i can noted vanessa standing in the middle of her local grocery store and reveling in the feeling of having most of her civil rights intact i dont know how many moments like these ill get to have so i figure i should stockpile some for the next four to eight years before its too late

no matter how you feel about zoos this story will make you feel good 
zoo administrators are always experimenting with ways to make their animals caged experiences as accommodating to their needs as possible with varying degrees of success but thanks to an innovative and humane new initiative one of our most beloved institutions is setting a new standard for animal rights the san diego zoo has taped telescopes to all of their animals heads so that they can look at the planets 
what a tremendous step forward 
for decades the san diego zoo led the way in terms of tourist attractions but this latest move proves that they are even more committed to treating their animals with dignity with a telescope affixed to each animals head these incredible creatures can now gaze at the planets just by looking up visitors can take great comfort knowing that the ostriches chinchillas and all other animals are no longer limited to just looking at trees dirt or clouds as they had been for so many heartbreaking years 
according to president and ceo douglas myers the project directly addresses a basic right of all animals 
when you consider the challenges we face when improving animal captivity strapping a telescope snugly to each animals head is a nobrainer said myers these are beautiful creatures that deserve to look at the planets 
indeed most zoo animals have never had the ability to take in the wonders of our galaxy but in san diego its now a key part of every animals care plan at any moment an otter can swivel his head and take a look at saturn a zebra can glance up from grazing to observe a sea of constellations seemingly close enough to lick and when the park welcomed a new fox last month tourists were able to watch as zoologists strapped a tiny telescope to his head equipped with a polarized filter to protect his sensitive eyes 
wow

automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements no matter your stance on cuttingedge technology in the office there is no doubt that its a swiftly approaching reality according to a new study released by stanford university americans can expect over  percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by  
the future is coming and its coming fast 
thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out résumés from people with middle eastern last names trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and costeffectiveness than human labor 
people think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future when truthfully its right around the corner said stanford computer scientist dr oliver thorpe who spearheaded the new study were already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day 
with intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities senior citizens and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy within  years marketavailable computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens within  years roving automatons will travel about openplan offices smacking female subordinates buttocks with their carbonfiber paddle attachments adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences 
some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human onthejob prejudice but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line thorpe notes that maintaining a fuckedup culture of occupational disparity is expensive and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semiautonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost theyll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide

we apologize that we werent able to remove this disrespectful picture of our presidentelect completely but we did what we could and stretched it out all wide you can barely tell its donald trump  regardless of whatever political views you hold it is disrespectful to show a picture of the commanderinchief along with a caption like so this is what that pile of straw on his head is for 
were talking with our programmers now to figure out a way to delete these images from the web hopefully they will develop a method for doing so in the near future in the meantime we have preserved the dignity of presidentelect trump by stretching his face out and making his eyes huge nobody will be able to recognize that the man in this image is our new president  of course it would still be fine to disagree with president trump if you dont support his policies a healthy democracy allows dissent and debate however implying that the president wears a toupee when there is no evidence that he does is a crass breach of proper decorum 
the presidency is the most hallowed office in our nation and it is worthy of reverence and decorum at all times ideally this image of donald trumps toupee flying off in the wind would no longer be on our website since this is currently impossible weve used the magic of photoshop to make his head very tall and thin his identity is obscured this bald man could be anybody  no matter who is president you address them as sir not donald the hutt we would quickly remove this if the american people choose trump on november  
this degrading photoshop of president trumps face on jabba the hutts body is immature and degrading and wed remove it if we could since we currently dont know how weve at least given him a tie to wear to imbue him with the poise and decorum the presidency confers on all who hold that hallowed office  comparing president trump to adolf hitler would remain a valid political commentary but making him bald in addition is completely uncalled for if donald trump is elected we promise to restore his normal hair to this image 
now that the american electorate has chosen donald trump to lead our nation this image depicting him as a bald adolf hitler has become an unsubtle and tactless political statement that does not meet our exacting editorial standards weve given presidentelect trump his hair back in an effort to restore his dignity  for now let us enjoy this humorous photoshop and its accompanying caption i am going to build a wig and mexico is going to pay for it during a trump presidency it would no longer have a place in the national discourse

it looks like presidentelect donald trump is wasting no time making his mark on washington hes already gotten to work appointing his new cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration and if it wasnt already clear that things are going to be done trumps way for the next four years donald trump just whispered hope you like to make ham motherfucker to a white house executive chef 
wow it looks like washington is going to be a very different place under president trump 
those who witnessed the encounter say that during a recent visit to the white house trump caught sight of a highranking member of the white house kitchen waved him over and said come here let me talk to you a minute in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening when the chef got close to trump the presidentelect shook his hand pulled him close and began whispering that once he got sworn in the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham  
members of the white house staff overheard the phrases ham is your life now idiot and i dont care what else you can cook i only want ham as trump whispered to the chef whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nations newest president was telling him they also say that trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham 
now thats the sign of a president who isnt afraid to shake things up 
while many americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of trumps presidential campaign those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one no other president would grab a white house chef by the hand and whisper you live in ham world now motherfucker 
and it seems as if presidentelect trump has a concrete plan in place as well trump didnt just tell the white house chef that he wanted ham in general he had specific types of ham that he wanted including baked ham smoked ham all the time and ham with frosting trump was also overheard telling the white house chef youre also going to be making something called a pork jackhammer which i just invented during the limo ride over here its incredibly dangerous to make and i want to eat it every day 
it definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in washington you just know its not going to be business as usual in dc anymore when donald trump isnt afraid to look a white house chef right in the eye and say when i ask for chinese food that just means soy sauce on ham when i ask for sushi thats raw ham president trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast lunch and dinner the moment i take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a porkfueled hellscape 
people who voted for trump wanted a maverick and it looks like they got one 
after about two minutes of whispering hamrelated threats trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened but his message was clear when donald trump becomes president hes going to play by his own rules and hes only going to eat ham if president trump has his way life in the white house might become completely unrecognizable",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3465/3/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,said find oliver platt alicia keys tim cook say,email looks like presidentelect donald trump wasting time making mark washington hes already gotten work appointing new cabinet members laying groundwork new administration wasnt already clear things going done trumps way next four years donald trump whispered hope like make ham motherfucker white house executive chef wow looks like washington going different place president trump witnessed encounter say recent visit white house trump caught sight highranking member white house kitchen waved said come let talk minute voice somehow cordial threatening chef got close trump presidentelect shook hand pulled close began whispering got sworn chef would nothing cooking ham members white house staff overheard phrases ham life idiot dont care else cook want ham trump whispered chef whose eyes grew wide silent fear listened nations newest president telling also say trump briefly smiled wave photographers turning back chef dark menacing expression face continue whispering ham thats sign president isnt afraid shake things many americans deeply troubled bigoted rhetoric trumps presidential campaign voted protest political establishment got pretty happy story like one president would grab white house chef hand whisper live ham world motherfucker seems presidentelect trump concrete plan place well trump didnt tell white house chef wanted ham general specific types ham wanted including baked ham smoked ham time ham frosting trump also overheard telling white house chef youre also going making something called pork jackhammer invented limo ride incredibly dangerous make want eat every day definitely looks like going new era washington know going business usual dc anymore donald trump isnt afraid look white house chef right eye say ask chinese food means soy sauce ham ask sushi thats raw ham president trump eating barges ham breakfast lunch dinner moment take oath office moment world becomes porkfueled hellscape people voted trump wanted maverick looks like got one two minutes whispering hamrelated threats trump stepped away chef began smiling waving surrounding press nothing happened message clear donald trump becomes president hes going play rules hes going eat ham president trump way life white house might become completely unrecognizable,1,,,,,

oh how the mighty have fallen 
its always an embarrassing moment when a highpowered executive suffers a scandal that forces him or her to resign but it looks like yet another head honcho is about to step into that humiliating spotlight after nearly a decade on the job the ceo of beans has officially stepped down following reports that there cannot be a ceo of beans 
yikes talk about a fall from grace 
patrick buckley was an ambitious leader as the ceo of beans often telling people that he was in charge of every single bean that came out of the dirt and even going so far as to print up business cards with ceo of beans listed right on the front with beans being such a common staple of diets worldwide a man in mr buckleys position may have seemed poised to become one of the most powerful people in the food industry but in the blink of an eye everything the executive had been working for came crashing down before him as reports began to circulate late last week that while bean manufacturers may have ceos its impossible for beans in general to have a ceo of their own 
after a wonderful career at the helm of beans it has become apparent that there is no such thing as my job the scandalized ceo wrote in a brief statement to the press in light of this news that my position and my former role as director of garbanzo do not exist it seems prudent that i step down immediately i am proud of the work i have done for beans during my tenure and i look forward to continuing to prepare and eat beans in the future 
as of this morning the board of directors of beans has accepted mr buckleys resignation and then the members promptly stepped down themselves amidst reports that beans cannot have a board of directors either 
making matters worse the entire corporate structure of beans now finds itself crumbling from the top all the way down as an onslaught of new allegations indicate that beans as a relatively loose category of foods has never been and cannot be a staffable organization 
wow its hard to imagine how mr buckley will ever bounce back from such a disgrace but hopefully he learns an important lesson from all this ceos take note your mistakes will always come back to haunt you",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3466/9/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,news pr disaster president panasonic forced resign panasonic tvs ascended heaven without warning,email oh mighty fallen always embarrassing moment highpowered executive suffers scandal forces resign looks like yet another head honcho step humiliating spotlight nearly decade job ceo beans officially stepped following reports cannot ceo beans yikes talk fall grace patrick buckley ambitious leader ceo beans often telling people charge every single bean came dirt even going far print business cards ceo beans listed right front beans common staple diets worldwide man mr buckleys position may seemed poised become one powerful people food industry blink eye everything executive working came crashing reports began circulate late last week bean manufacturers may ceos impossible beans general ceo wonderful career helm beans become apparent thing job scandalized ceo wrote brief statement press light news position former role director garbanzo exist seems prudent step immediately proud work done beans tenure look forward continuing prepare eat beans future morning board directors beans accepted mr buckleys resignation members promptly stepped amidst reports beans cannot board directors either making matters worse entire corporate structure beans finds crumbling top way onslaught new allegations indicate beans relatively loose category foods never cannot staffable organization wow hard imagine mr buckley ever bounce back disgrace hopefully learns important lesson ceos take note mistakes always come back haunt,1,,,,,

the cruelty of factory farms is a daily nightmare for billions of animals but that might soon start to change thanks to a forwardthinking initiative by one of the biggest names in the meat industry in a humane act of compassion for their livestock the oscar mayer company now requires its pork suppliers to give their pigs one thrilling sexual experience before sending them to slaughter 
its pretty difficult to overstate what a huge leap forward this is for animal rights 
the details of the new policy are extremely promising once a pig reaches sexual maturity factory workers must lather it in a warming lubricant and place it in an outdoor pen where it will encounter dozens of sows in heat and boars specially bred to produce voluptuously potent pheromone levels the pigs will then be encouraged to partake in any variety of sowonboar sowonsow boaronboar or autoerotic swineplay they prefer only after theyve bellowed long guttural squeals of satisfaction will these pigs be killed processed and separated into their desirable parts for human consumption 
conscious consumers can rest assured oscar mayer pork will have been treated to full prostate and teat stimulation via doubleprodded toys clamps and strategically placed ice cubes before being sent to the slaughterhouse farmers will even have to install sprinklers emitting warm hog urine for any pig who might be into that 
wow it seems like oscar mayer is truly dedicated to setting a new bar for ethical animal treatment 
to put this in perspective not even freerange operations keep pig behavior specialists onsite to spot hogs nearing ejaculation and pull them away in order to temporarily evade orgasm thereby extending the hogs arousal and making their eventual climaxes that much more explosive for a household meat brand like oscar mayer to endorse this kind of practice is a really really big deal 
before slaughter we intend to treat our pigs to nothing less than the absolute highest order of hoofshattering orgasms said oscar mayer president mark magnesen in a press release our commitment to the wellbeing of animals means ensuring that no pig reaches an abbatoir without first experiencing a flesh romp so sensational it causes their numbing limbs to buckle under fullbodied tailtosnout pleasure 
just yes even peta has to admit that this is a great new direction for pork producers 
taste tests held by the company revealed that customers unanimously preferred meat from sexually gratified pigs over meat from pigs raised under typical factoryfarm stresses interested in trying some yourself or just want to support the cause look for the special label theyve created to specify that their products came from a pig they made squeal in wanton rapture 
well it looks like oscar mayer is finally getting on the right side of animal rights history this is exactly the thoughtful kind of action consumers want to see food companies enact they could have easily just asked suppliers to masturbate a few pigs to completion and called it change but the level of care theyre pouring into these bacchanalian thrills shows that theyre truly making animal welfare a priority 
any progress for farm animals is welcome progress and hopefully this is a sign of even better living conditions to come one blowout circus of carnal delights is the least they can do for these pigs",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3469/7/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,life people came garage sale seem sticking around dinner,email cruelty factory farms daily nightmare billions animals might soon start change thanks forwardthinking initiative one biggest names meat industry humane act compassion livestock oscar mayer company requires pork suppliers give pigs one thrilling sexual experience sending slaughter pretty difficult overstate huge leap forward animal rights details new policy extremely promising pig reaches sexual maturity factory workers must lather warming lubricant place outdoor pen encounter dozens sows heat boars specially bred produce voluptuously potent pheromone levels pigs encouraged partake variety sowonboar sowonsow boaronboar autoerotic swineplay prefer theyve bellowed long guttural squeals satisfaction pigs killed processed separated desirable parts human consumption conscious consumers rest assured oscar mayer pork treated full prostate teat stimulation via doubleprodded toys clamps strategically placed ice cubes sent slaughterhouse farmers even install sprinklers emitting warm hog urine pig might wow seems like oscar mayer truly dedicated setting new bar ethical animal treatment put perspective even freerange operations keep pig behavior specialists onsite spot hogs nearing ejaculation pull away order temporarily evade orgasm thereby extending hogs arousal making eventual climaxes much explosive household meat brand like oscar mayer endorse kind practice really really big deal slaughter intend treat pigs nothing less absolute highest order hoofshattering orgasms said oscar mayer president mark magnesen press release commitment wellbeing animals means ensuring pig reaches abbatoir without first experiencing flesh romp sensational causes numbing limbs buckle fullbodied tailtosnout pleasure yes even peta admit great new direction pork producers taste tests held company revealed customers unanimously preferred meat sexually gratified pigs meat pigs raised typical factoryfarm stresses interested trying want support cause look special label theyve created specify products came pig made squeal wanton rapture well looks like oscar mayer finally getting right side animal rights history exactly thoughtful kind action consumers want see food companies enact could easily asked suppliers masturbate pigs completion called change level care theyre pouring bacchanalian thrills shows theyre truly making animal welfare priority progress farm animals welcome progress hopefully sign even better living conditions come one blowout circus carnal delights least pigs,1,,,,,

 dont climb the trees apple trees are for picking not climbing fail to heed this rule and you might just find yourself stuck in the cruel autumn shadow of the punishment orchard swinging from a tree branch in the regular orchard wont seem worth it once youre lashed to a hayride and dumped in the middle of this sprawling acre wasteland where the fog never lifts and the apples are all way too hot to pick 
 twist dont pull heads up pulling an apple can inadvertently knock down other fruit and risks damaging the tree better to carefully twist the apple upwards than be consigned to the punishment orchards sea of wet beige trees with no end in sight keep this rule in mind and you will never get trapped in the pitchblack sap oozing out of all the trees nor will you be driven mad by the winds that constantly whisper a summary of dale earnhardts death 
 dont waste fruit the stench of bleach and pennies will be the surefire sign that your decision to just toss imperfect apples onto the ground of the normal orchard has landed you in the wicked seething grove of the punishment orchard a chorus of middleaged men shrouded by crude scarecrow masks will taunt you with their vexing rhyme we are the men who have picked before  your hands are bags your days no more looking down condemned travelers will realize the infectious verse has replaced their hands with reusable grocery bags and they can no longer remember important birthdays 
 dont eat the apples until youve paid youll want to pay upfront if you dont want to wake up in the wicker prison at the base of the tree of despair a beige monstrosity whose sprawling tendrils lie directly under the approach path of the regional airport you must sit in your atonement basket while the depraved orphaned children of the punishment orchard throw scalding apples at your head as part of one of their simpleminded religious rituals 
 dont pick outside the designated areas follow the clearly posted signs in sunny and cheerful normal orchard and you should be fine wanderers will have their names recorded on the punishment orchards ledger of bad deeds a shameful blight that nearly cost william rehnquist his appointment to the supreme court in  then they will be given incorrect directions which will only send them deeper into the bowels of the punishment orchard where the cider warden bathes himself in bleach and spare change even years after a stay in the punishment orchard the smell of either of these items will send you into a vivid vietnam flashback regardless of whether or not you fought in vietnam 
 no running its natural to let the excitement of apple picking get the best of you just dont be surprised if you draw the ire of the punishment picker setting aside his chisel and cigar he will take an afternoon off from making sculptures of mussolini having a great time in order to make a sculpture of you getting stung by a bee your cries of remorse will be drowned out by the children of the punishment orchard cheering gather your coins friends the punishment man of the forest has taken a day off of sculpting a happy mussolini in order to immortalize a delinquent being humiliated by a bee

beautiful take a look at the sidebyside pictures above to see just how similar these two really are 
when donald trump announced his campaign last summer paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidates name on his garage door but paul probably never would have guessed that one year later just a few towns over from him ayeshas own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word paul and ayesha may be from totally different walks of life but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined 
at the end of the day it doesnt matter whether their skin is white or brown it doesnt matter whether they worship god or allah and it doesnt matter whether the word trump has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint all that matters is the commonality they share in having the word trump painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see 
amazing it just goes to show you should never judge a book by its cover 
at a time when our country feels so divided stories like this one give us hope for humanity on the surface paul and ayesha couldnt be more different but the messages painted or spraypainted across their garages are one in the same what an amazing reminder that were not so different after all",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3470/8/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,life applepicking nonos avoid dont want end punishment orchard,email get ready heartwarming story youll read day met paul langdon ayesha qamar street might think nothing common paul retired firefighter ayesha law student paul lived suburb columbus entire life ayesha immigrated ohio pakistan teen paul devout christian ayesha muslim dig little deeper youll find share common bond paul ayesha trump painted garages beautiful take look sidebyside pictures see similar two really donald trump announced campaign last summer paul knew wanted show support painting large sign candidates name garage door paul probably never would guessed one year later towns ayeshas garage would painted literally exact word paul ayesha may totally different walks life comes name currently painted garages two common ever could imagined end day doesnt matter whether skin white brown doesnt matter whether worship god allah doesnt matter whether word trump carefully lettered hastily scrawled across garage brusque spray paint matters commonality share word trump painted homes entire neighborhood see amazing goes show never judge book cover time country feels divided stories like one give us hope humanity surface paul ayesha couldnt different messages painted spraypainted across garages one amazing reminder different,1,,,,,

as a parent you always have to be aware of what lessons your child is learning from the world around him or her i know that i wont be able to protect my yearold james from every bad thing out there but on a recent trip to the grocery store i was utterly appalled by a disturbing trend our country has become desensitized to violence in hotsauce names and its a big problem 
you cant walk down your grocers sauce isle without being bombarded by hotsauce names that romanticize violence tears of blood nuclear bombardment chile extract and death on the toilet have become standard fare in the hotsauce industry an innocent trip to purchase a simple bottle of ketchup now subliminally exposes shoppers and our impressionable children to dozens of gruesome descriptions of burning flesh brutal deaths and massive ass damage 
as soon as the hotsauce industry agreed it was okay to allow names like cremation in a bottle pepper sauce and ass grave cajun sauce to appear on store shelves any shred of decency went out the window an arms race began to see who could come up with the most violent and gory sauce name society be damned and it needs to stop before our children internalize these sorts of brutal names as the norm for hotsauce labels 
hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today 
i took my son james to my favorite mexican restaurant this past weekend and he didnt even blink when he saw a bottle with volcanic crucification written out in flames if he isnt bothered by this whos to say if he would even think twice if he one day saw a hot sauce called ghost pepper throat thresher 
i pray that we correct course in this country before anyone decides to make that hot sauce 
it wasnt always like this hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today names like franks red hot let you know you were in for some serious heat but left something to the imagination but there is no longer a moral standard for hotsauce names now all it takes to begin leading a child down a bad path is for them to glance at a sauce bottle in a friends refrigerator door

 chimps will betray their own to get their hands on italian food as with all chimps the ones i studied in gombe were absolutely obsessed with italian food and would go to extraordinary lengths to get their hands on some one day the troops alpha male whom i called goliath managed to acquire a plate of linguine humphrey a younger male saw goliaths linguine and became incredibly jealous he offered to give goliath his most prized possessiona vacant hornet nest that he enjoyed having sex within exchange for the linguine but goliath declined as he already had a hornet nest of his own desperate to eat the linguine humphrey threw some pebbles to divert goliaths attention then snuck up behind him and ripped his head off allowing him to take the italian food from his superior it was a gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene 
 when chimpanzee communities encounter a japanese researcher they will try to put them in jail my colleague dr kiyoshi yamamoto discovered this when chimps dragged him from his tent in the middle of the night down to the local prison the apes would then approach the towns sheriff with their hands out expecting a food reward it was truly shocking to learn that chimpanzees are capable of such things nature is not always pretty 
 most chimps can vocalize the phrase oh no they like to yell it while they defecate  chimps dont like it when you blow up one of their family members with a grenade one of my young researchers sofia manfredi discovered this after rolling an active grenade into a ditch where several male siblings were sharing a lunch of termites and soup the grenade exploded the youngest one into a red mist of viscera and bone and curiously the other brothers seemed to become rather disheartened 
 chimps revere hippos when they become aware of a hippo in the vicinity chimps stop whatever theyre doing and take turns honoring the beast they bring offerings of plump salamanders crushed soda cans and other treasures theyve found in the dirt and they join together in an angelic chorus of growls to soothe the hippo new mothers will rub their infants against the hippos groin to bless them with his virility the troops elders will break off their incisors with a rock and fashion a crude crown of teeth for the hippo to wear if the hippo becomes aggressive towards them they do not resist in fact it is an honor for them to be crushed by the hippo and they will often place their heads on the ground next to his hooves in hopes that he might accidentally stomp their skulls flat 
 if a chimp dunks its head into a bucket of horchata for an hour it will die whenever chimps discover a large pail of horchata in the forest the eldest female of the group will approach it and slowly lower her head into the liquid remaining there for an hour or more until another chimp yanks her out of it it was fascinating to observe the way their social structure altered afterwards with the next eldest female unfailingly rising up to lead the groups children in licking the sweet rice milk from their deceased matriarchs body",english,clickhole.com,http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3472/7/16x9/1200.jpg,satire,life finding common ground white man muslim woman trump painted garages,email jane goodall dedicated life studying primates insights gained evolutionary ancestors truly powerful prepare breath taken away dr goodalls words chimps betray get hands italian food chimps ones studied gombe absolutely obsessed italian food would go extraordinary lengths get hands one day troops alpha male called goliath managed acquire plate linguine humphrey younger male saw goliaths linguine became incredibly jealous offered give goliath prized possessiona vacant hornet nest enjoyed sex within exchange linguine goliath declined already hornet nest desperate eat linguine humphrey threw pebbles divert goliaths attention snuck behind ripped head allowing take italian food superior gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene chimpanzee communities encounter japanese researcher try put jail colleague dr kiyoshi yamamoto discovered chimps dragged tent middle night local prison apes would approach towns sheriff hands expecting food reward truly shocking learn chimpanzees capable things nature always pretty chimps vocalize phrase oh like yell defecate chimps dont like blow one family members grenade one young researchers sofia manfredi discovered rolling active grenade ditch several male siblings sharing lunch termites soup grenade exploded youngest one red mist viscera bone curiously brothers seemed become rather disheartened chimps revere hippos become aware hippo vicinity chimps stop whatever theyre take turns honoring beast bring offerings plump salamanders crushed soda cans treasures theyve found dirt join together angelic chorus growls soothe hippo new mothers rub infants hippos groin bless virility troops elders break incisors rock fashion crude crown teeth hippo wear hippo becomes aggressive towards resist fact honor crushed hippo often place heads ground next hooves hopes might accidentally stomp skulls flat chimp dunks head bucket horchata hour die whenever chimps discover large pail horchata forest eldest female group approach slowly lower head liquid remaining hour another chimp yanks fascinating observe way social structure altered afterwards next eldest female unfailingly rising lead groups children licking sweet rice milk deceased matriarchs body,1,,,,,

but after years of media indoctrination its easy to forget the other lie that helped rally the country around the illegal invasion of iraq 
john mccain  there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may??and i emphasize may??have come from iraq 
david letterman  oh is that right 
john mccain  if that should be the case thats when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made 
source mccain and the anthrax scare    higher quality clip 
when iraq finally admitted having these weapons in  the quantities were vast less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax a little bit about this amount  this is just about the amount of a teaspoon  less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the united states senate in the fall of  this forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope 
iraq declared  liters of anthrax but unscom estimates that saddam hussein could have produced  liters if concentrated into this dry form this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons and saddam hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonfull of this deadly material 
source colin powells presentation to the un on iraq wmd    
although it is difficult to remember at this point the anthrax scare of late  was widely seen as a followup to the  attacks and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the socalled war on terror beginning in late september and continuing for several weeks multiple anthraxlaced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two us senators killing five and injuring  
it did not take long however for the neocons in the bush administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen saddam hussein and osama bin laden 
in his book  the  anthrax deception  dr graeme macqueen describes this as the double perpetrator hypothesis an attempt to blame the attacks on both al qaeda and iraq he writes 
what i call the double perpetrator hypothesis held that bin ladens group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores namely iraq 
this hypothesis insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently 
macqueen well the young woman who opened senator daschles mailafghanistan and iraq    
the story of iraqi collusion with al qaeda sounded credible enough to an american public that had no familiarity with the muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of  the only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie 
when key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite a signature of the iraqi anthrax program the bush administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between saddam and the attacks 
as filmmaker robbie martin explains in his documentary american anthrax  however that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media 
martin points to disgraced exnew york times journalist and iraqi wmd pusher judy miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie iraq to the anthrax letters 
as we now know of course the anthrax attacks were a false flag event 
by early  it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases at fort detrick a key facility within americas own bioweapons program soon suspicion fell on steven hatfill a person of interest identified by the fbi who eventually won a  million lawsuit against the department of justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press the blame for the attacks was then pinned on bruce ivins a researcher at fort detrick who conveniently died before the fbi could identify him or try him in court the national academy of sciences and the government accountability office have both cast doubt on the fbis scientific investigation of the attacks however and a whistleblower within the fbis own investigation has revealed that the bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate ivins 
whoever the perpetrator may have beeneven accepting that ivins was the attackerit is a fact that the attacks were a false flag using crudely forged letters to convince the american public that they were written by al qaeda agents and that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in iraq 
the legacy of that war remains with us today the middle east including iraq itself remains in chaos a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country an invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications 
the blood of a million dead iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war and those who aided and abetted those liars 
meanwhile the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression",english,coasttocoastam.com,http://www.coasttocoastam.com/cimages/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/coast-to-coast/repository/thumbnails/astronaut-on-mars/936926-1-eng-US/Astronaut-on-Mars.jpg,bs,robotic advancements mars ancient aliens,remember lies led us iraq war years media indoctrination easy forget lie helped rally country around illegal invasion iraq john mccain indication dont conclusions anthrax may emphasize may come iraq david letterman oh right john mccain case thats tough decisions gonna made source mccain anthrax scare higher quality clip iraq finally admitted weapons quantities vast less teaspoon dry anthrax little bit amount amount teaspoon less teaspoon full dry anthrax envelope shut united states senate fall forced several hundred people undergo emergency medical treatment killed two postal workers amount quantity inside envelope iraq declared liters anthrax unscom estimates saddam hussein could produced liters concentrated dry form amount would enough fill tens upon tens upon tens thousands teaspoons saddam hussein verifiably accounted even one teaspoonfull deadly material source colin powells presentation un iraq wmd although difficult remember point anthrax scare late widely seen followup attacks sign things come dawn socalled war terror beginning late september continuing several weeks multiple anthraxlaced letters mailed various media offices offices two us senators killing five injuring take long however neocons bush administration start insinuating anthrax scare tied two favourite boogeymen saddam hussein osama bin laden book anthrax deception dr graeme macqueen describes double perpetrator hypothesis attempt blame attacks al qaeda iraq writes call double perpetrator hypothesis held bin ladens group sent anthrax spores mail group state sponsor supplied spores namely iraq hypothesis insinuated key government officials parroted press added benefit explaining anthrax spores used attack could weaponized efficiently macqueen well young woman opened senator daschles mailafghanistan iraq story iraqi collusion al qaeda sounded credible enough american public familiarity muslim world still reeling shock attacks problem story complete lie key government scientists came denounce claim anthrax contained traces bentonite signature iraqi anthrax program bush administration sought distance direct connection saddam attacks filmmaker robbie martin explains documentary american anthrax however connection reinforced public way complicit corporate media martin points disgraced exnew york times journalist iraqi wmd pusher judy miller particularly egregious example media laid groundwork campaign tie iraq anthrax letters know course anthrax attacks false flag event early confirmed anthrax sourced us army medical research institute infectious diseases fort detrick key facility within americas bioweapons program soon suspicion fell steven hatfill person interest identified fbi eventually million lawsuit department justice falsely accusing participation attacks illegally leaking identity press blame attacks pinned bruce ivins researcher fort detrick conveniently died fbi could identify try court national academy sciences government accountability office cast doubt fbis scientific investigation attacks however whistleblower within fbis investigation revealed bureau sitting evidence would exonerate ivins whoever perpetrator may beeneven accepting ivins attackerit fact attacks false flag using crudely forged letters convince american public written al qaeda agents false flag aided government officials corporate media talking heads happy propagate false story lead war iraq legacy war remains us today middle east including iraq remains chaos direct result illegal invasion occupation country invasion occupation sold public back brazen lies outright fabrications blood million dead iraqis stains hands lied public war aided abetted liars meanwhile anthrax attacks remain case study false flag event used whip public hysteria led supporting illegal wars aggression,1,,,,,

it comes from a very ancient democracy you see 
you mean it comes from a world of lizards 
no said ford who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people 
odd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy 
i did said ford it is 
so said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont the people get rid of the lizards 
it honestly doesnt occur to them said ford theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want 
you mean they actually vote for the lizards 
oh yes said ford with a shrug of course 
but said arthur going for the big one again why 
because if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin 
what 
i said said ford with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin 
ill look tell me about the lizards 
ford shrugged again 
some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he said theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones got to say it 
if only this was a joke but here we are on the verge of a contest between the two least respected most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history and some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them 
if there is any solace at all in this years selection cycle it is that as the corbett report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception there is absolutely nothing at stake here the presidential figureheads are mere puppets false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military economic and diplomatic machinery of the usled world empire 
do you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years hoping against hope that the public doesnt use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power dashing decades or centuries of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions let me answer that one for you no no they do not 
but dont take my word for it take emma goldman as shes been reputed to have said and if she didnt feel free to tell other people that i said it if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal 
or take hl mencken who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped  
the stateor to make the matter more concrete the governmentconsists of a gang of men exactly like you and me they have taking one with another no special talent for the business of government they have only a talent for getting and holding office their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they cant get and to promise to give it to them nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing the tenth time it is made good by looting a to satisfy b in other words government is a broker in pillage and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods 
or take lysander spooner who wrote  
the principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men as to which of them shall be masters and which of them slaves a contest that  however bloody  can in the nature of things never be finally closed so long as man refuses to be a slave 
or wendy mcelroy who reminds us that 
voting is not an act of political freedom it is an act of political conformity those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence they are screaming in the politicians ear you do not represent me this is not a process in which my voice matters i do not believe you 
yes voting is worse than a dead end its less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache its more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table it is evil immoral and contemptible it is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved too 
but as i pointed out in yesterdays conversation with larken rose if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesnt matter anyway and will not change anything at all it will not even register as a protest as some would like to believe since the elections are rigged and the votes arent counted 
so if you are so inclined knock yourself out cast a ballot but instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless meaningless and immoral act can we at least agree to use the next  days to do something actually productive i leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase actually productive but if youd allow me to offer some humble suggestions

even after the election the clinton side continues with lawless agitation intimidation and violence in the streets demonstrating to reasonable people everywhere that americans did make the right choice thank you msm and mr soros for showing everyone just how free democratic big hearted and open the globalist new world order would really be if hillary had won 
if the us election rules had been that the candidates had to win the popular vote in order to be elected then trump would have campaigned more vigorously in the large cities and likely also would have won that contest in a landslide but how much more of a landslide that would have been can be seen by considering what really happened 
the people who supported trump mainly voted for jobs and to save core values and constitutional rights from a misguided globalism being imposed upon them they were essentially voting to save their nation from an establishment which has been systematically outsourcing just about everything which matters to them however despite the stakes they were and remain essentially principled people adhering to the electoral rules of fair play for lawful democratic change the clinton side on the other hand appeared devoid of any real principles other than their own interests during the election the clinton side used intimidation tactics of paid agitators they cheated by swelling voters lists by opening the border and signing up droves of illegal immigrants even voter fraud and rigged voting machines were acceptable to them but most of all they were supported by an absolutely biased corrupt and lying mainstream media the effect of the media was so pervasive that trump supporters were generally so ridiculed and shunned that few made their views known without such dishonest illegal and oppressive tactics by the clinton side the trump vote would most certainly have been much much greater in the circumstances the clinton loss could not be more embarrassing for her her party and the msm

whew finally the charade is over donald trump is now the president of the united states of america what does that mean it means that simpsons prediction came true httpswwwthesuncouknewsthesimpsonscorrectlypredictedadonaldtrumppresidencyyearsagoinepisodesetinthenearfuture 
so now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future goodbye tarot cards et al in  i recall reading a survey which concluded that america was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years twentyone years later it looks like that prediction was true given that women in america to this day are paid  of what men are paid it is not surprising that americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the white house in any place other than the presidents bed 
so what does trump mean for america for american muslims for muslims worldwide for nonwhites in america and globally i am asking this rhetorical question as i see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around i apologize for taking a different view i see the trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that donald trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was 
what does trump mean for america i hope he will be the best thing that happened to america ever i hope that he can truly make america great again i say that because though i am not american should i say thank god i am one who believes that a truly great america can make this world great the world truly needs to change we need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate caring fighting against injustice corruption and poverty disease and ignorance which nation is better suited to lead that fight america has the resources the intelligence the education and the leadership ability which i hope it chooses to exercise trump won on the antiestablishment platform i support that fully the establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly the economy crashed and obama rewarded those who crashed it people were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every american to have two homes not only one yet they are on the streets i hope trump can put americans back in their own homes 
bush father and son started never ending wars obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes  using technology to create bug splats the arrogance is incredible  thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation obamas dabbling what else to call it in middle eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of afghanistan and iraq and new misery for people of syria and by inference for the rest of the world and to top it all isis came into being because of all of the above the credit can be shared by all of them so trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this i sincerely hope so 
all the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality it is easy to talk about kicking out the mexicans and so on but the day he does that reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted probrexit that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor dont need the rich when nice white americans get to pay  per potato they will realize the value of cheap labor meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the wall which he will do from the mexican side no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile so also the wonderful idea to outlaw the h visa i dont think it will take very long for trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes and that indians are not blond go figure that 
the good news is that trump made public what was private  racism misogyny in a country that never stops trumpeting about womens equality support for genocide wars and weapons sales the evils of unbridled capitalism lockerroom conversations which indicate attitudes  have all come out of the closet and lockerroom now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things to get off their backsides and bring about change they can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to saying it is not happening here trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of trump tower sorry for so much bad punning in one breath but there you go 
as for muslims and trump believe me trump is far better than what muslims have seen in the past he is far better than what we have today take sisi the oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer the paki leadership and i can think of several more and trump begins to look like a choir boy what will he do that is not already happening frankly i dont know and dont care to speculate because the prime movers behind muslim affairs and how they are are muslims themselves our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure ordinary citizens pay the price but whats new about that the fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by play endings depend on the script not on the players 
india is a classic example where a socalled minority of  million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends but indian muslims seem to be satisfied with that so who is anyone else to complain if you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied then i must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious get their act together change their leaders and write their own script  million is not a minority it is a nation but only if it chooses to be same story for muslims globally no point in blaming trump or looking up to him to find solutions it is our problem and we must solve it so let us start doing that 
two other points what about wars global warming and such issues well when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them how can you pin it all on trump if weapons are made and sold there will be wars wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them that people die is incidental those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank dont those that do dont count they are collateral who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them if it wasnt for the bugs who splatted how would you assess the drones or their operators the fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on well bugs are bugs and thats all that there is to it 
global warming america decided on that when it chose bush instead of al gore for a minute i thought that was because they got confused because his name is al gore like al ghurair but then i realized that it was because he had a terminal problem he had a brain see his famous movie an inconvenient truth and you will see what i mean httpswwwalgorecomlibraryaninconvenienttruthdvd if you do nothing else buy this and see it at least you will know why you died since you chose that especially americans i believe it is only fair that you understand what you did with trump that came out in the open so get used to summer all year long you wont need to go to the french riviera for a tan you can get it at home that is not inconvenient 
add to this the effect ofunending wars refugee movement changing cultures security nightmares coming true widening gap between the rich and the poor global poverty and hunger preventable disease which is not prevented because theres no profit in it  when i think about all this and trumps election nero comes to mind renewing our link with tradition let us dance to the tune whats the use of fiddling otherwise 
final question that everyone is asking how safe is it to have someone like trump with his finger on the nuclear button 
my answer is the one who actually pressed that button was as different from trump as could be yet he did it let me leave you to figure out the rest 
meanwhile it is midnight where i live far away from trump and america and time to go to bed truly it is said that there is solace in sleep so good night world sleep well as long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility

Corbett,2016-11-24T22:02:00.000+02:00,interview   new world next week with james evan pilato,"in climate change  by nadia prupis  november   the researchers say  percent of core ecological processes on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that has not been expected for decades photo lwp kommunikációflickrcc 
climate change is already affecting life on earth despite a global temperature increase of just c according to a new study published in the journal science on friday 
nearly every ecosystem on the planet is being altered and plants and animals are being so affected that scientists may soon be forced to intervene to create humanassisted evolution the study titled the broad footprint of climate change from genes to biomes to people  found 
the researchers say  percent of core ecological processes on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that had not been expected for decades 
coauthor and professor john pandolfi of the university of queensland said  temperature extremes are causing evolutionary adaption in many species changing them genetically and physically these responses include changes in tolerances to high temperatures shifts in sexratios reduced body size and migration of species 
understanding the extent to which these goods and services have been impacted allows humans to plan and adapt to changing ecosystem conditions he said 
dr james watson associate professor of planning and environmental management at uqs school of geography added we are simply astonished at the level of change we observed which many of us in the scientific community did not expect to see for decades 
the changes have manifested in some species shifting to higher or lower ground as the planet heats up while others are becoming smaller as a higher surfaceareatobodymass ratio makes it easier to stay cool the independent reported  the outlet wrote 
for example six species of woodland salamander in the appalachian mountains have undergone an average eight per cent reduction in body size over the past  years 
slightly smaller lizards might not sound like something to overly concern humans but there is evidence this response is also affecting important sources of food 
these multilevel biological impacts of climate change will affect humans increasing disease outbreaks inconsistent crop yields and reduced fisheries productivity all threaten our food security said coauthor dr tom bridge 
average global temperatures have risen c since the industrial era the study states that this has already had broad and worrying impacts on natural systems with accumulating consequences for people minimizing the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes must now be a key policy priority for all nations 
the study called on governments to follow through on the promises made in the paris climate agreement  which aims to keep global warming below a c thresholdalthough an increasing amount of scientists are sounding the alarm that even those pledges may be too little too late 
time is running out for a globally synchronized response to climate change that integrates adequate protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services the study continued 
it is no longer sensible to consider this as a concern for the futureif we dont act quickly to curb emissions it is likely that every ecosystem across earth will fundamentally change in our lifetimes said dr watson this work is licensed under a creative commons attributionshare alike  license share this",english,corbettreport.com,No Image URL,bs,interview new world next week james evan pilato,climate change nadia prupis november researchers say percent core ecological processes land sea affected climate change way expected decades photo lwp kommunikációflickrcc climate change already affecting life earth despite global temperature increase c according new study published journal science friday nearly every ecosystem planet altered plants animals affected scientists may soon forced intervene create humanassisted evolution study titled broad footprint climate change genes biomes people found researchers say percent core ecological processes land sea affected climate change way expected decades coauthor professor john pandolfi university queensland said temperature extremes causing evolutionary adaption many species changing genetically physically responses include changes tolerances high temperatures shifts sexratios reduced body size migration species understanding extent goods services impacted allows humans plan adapt changing ecosystem conditions said dr james watson associate professor planning environmental management uqs school geography added simply astonished level change observed many us scientific community expect see decades changes manifested species shifting higher lower ground planet heats others becoming smaller higher surfaceareatobodymass ratio makes easier stay cool independent reported outlet wrote example six species woodland salamander appalachian mountains undergone average eight per cent reduction body size past years slightly smaller lizards might sound like something overly concern humans evidence response also affecting important sources food multilevel biological impacts climate change affect humans increasing disease outbreaks inconsistent crop yields reduced fisheries productivity threaten food security said coauthor dr tom bridge average global temperatures risen c since industrial era study states already broad worrying impacts natural systems accumulating consequences people minimizing impacts climate change core ecological processes must key policy priority nations study called governments follow promises made paris climate agreement aims keep global warming c thresholdalthough increasing amount scientists sounding alarm even pledges may little late time running globally synchronized response climate change integrates adequate protection biodiversity ecosystem services study continued longer sensible consider concern futureif dont act quickly curb emissions likely every ecosystem across earth fundamentally change lifetimes said dr watson work licensed creative commons attributionshare alike license share,1,,,,,
No Author,2016-11-10T12:31:31.030+02:00,trump the president what does that mean for the world  countercurrentsorg,"napm condemns state and expert apathy on deaths of hundreds of adivasi children in malkangiri demands immediate medical relief and justice 
apex court must intervene urgently state must declare medical emergency 
rd nov  the national alliance of peoples movements is extremely pained and concerned about the rising number of deaths of adivasi children in the tribal district of malkangiri orissa due to outbreak of japanese encephalitis je while the deaths have crossed the unpardonable mark of  the govt as usual continues to undercut the number to less than the half of the actual deaths even taking the official figure of  deaths it an extremely serious case and calls for an urgent comprehensive action in a situation when state apathy and delay have been primary reasons for these avoidable deaths on such a large scale 
we are indeed shocked that the team of experts sent by the centre has tried to absolve the government of all responsibility by attributing the deaths to consumption of some local seeds bana chakundi and not to je and governmental delay thereby blaming the adivasis themselves for the deaths when as per the orissa govts statistics itself  cases are confirmed je there out to have been remedial medical response on a warfooting considering the seriousness of je which can be fatal or can lead to lifelong intellectual behavioral or neurological impairments in many cases it is also a serious question as to why the govt did not ensure timely incorporation of je immunization in the public health delivery as per who standards and remained in denial mode the extremely casual response of the medical department state govt and now even the centre through this expert team only demonstrates that even in this time of crisis the concern is more their onus and image than the life of the children 
public health expert dr sylvia karpagam in her reasoned counter to the centres report questions that when the socalled toxic seeds are consumed all round the year and by all families in the tribal region since generations it is intriguing as to why this epidemic erupts here only on children and why now one likely reason might be that the presence of je in the already malnourished children could have been aggravated by the consumption of the seeds in some cases but for the central team to take a generalized and extrapolated position on the basis of only  urine samples out of  official admitted death is certainly not a scientific way of medical research or does it appear convincing in the present circumstances many other experts as well have questioned the central teams unilateral conclusions merely on the basis of toxicity in the urine samples especially since je cases and deaths have been reported across the district even in the malkangiri town 
it is also pertinent to note that the expert team has remained completely silent on the crucial role or failure of the anganwadis and icds monitoring system in the state in providing nutritional and health support to children in the tribal areas this is despite the fact that the apex court has time and again attached highest priority to ensure health and nutrition in all the tribal tracts and hamlets across the country in the form of hot cooked meals this situation is clearly in violation of the orders of the supreme court in the right to food case civil writ petition no  in fact one has to only go through the fact finding reports by right to food campaign in malkangiri districts conducted in  as well as  the abysmal situation of public health infrastructure and food distribution systems are one of the main reasons behind the regular outbreak of je disease the rampant malnutrition under staffed public health institutions abysmal health infrastructure are providing the perfect breeding ground for outbreak and spread of the disease it is indeed ironical that while on the one hand the union ministry of women and child welfare is pushing for packaged foods and gearing up to sign corporate mous in violation of scs norms on the other the anganwadis and icds servises in many areas of malkangiri or elsewhere especially in tribal areas seem to be utter disarray 
in the light of this serious situation napm calls upon the centre and state to declare this as a medical emergency and ensure anti jeimmunization and other medical relief on a warfooting demands an independent enquiry into this crisis by a multimember team comprising of renowned public health professions independent health activists and doctors 
calls upon the national commission for scheduled tribes ncst and the national commission for protection of child rights ncpcr to immediately take cognizance of the situation and their team including commission members and medical experts to investigate the causes recommend immediate measures and speed up action on the ground 
calls upon the governor of orissa to make an immediate visit to the affected areas as the constitutional custodian of peace and good government for the tribal areas and ensure relief and justice to the adivasi children and families 
appeals to the honble supreme court to immediate take up this matter in the ongoing right to food case civil wp  and issue directions to the state and centre and also monitor the proceedings before the orissa high court in the ongoing pil against the je 
appeals to all progressive activists students the national media and propeople medical experts to reach malkangiri to assist the adivasis in whatever way possible establish the scientific and true reasons of the scale of deaths intervene to ensure immediate medical assistance and press for accountability of the state agencies and other actors involved

it was fiftyfour years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by isaac babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry the title of babels collection of short stories written when the jew and former menshevik was imbedded with prorevolution cossacks had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones 
for the backward peasants this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a decade being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time being however they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace bread and land it was the assault on the gentrys land that for the time being assuaged the peasants 
responding to an aggrieved muzhik peasant dyakov the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as redfaced with a gray mustache a black cape and wide red tatar trousers with silver stripes promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the muzhik cried out lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get up its on its last legs 
dyakovs ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like jesus raising lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he wrote 
you are insulting this horse my dear fellow dyakov answered with fierce conviction pure blasphemy my dear fellow and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus ring he stretched his magnificent legs his trousers girded by cords around the knees and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a severe penetrating eye licked some invisible command from his crimson palm and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly gray blossoming romeo her muzzle lolling her legs skidding under her feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience the mare slowly and deliberatey rose onto her legs and then we all saw dyakovs slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body shivering the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid doglike lovestruck eyes from dyakov 
so you seethis is a horse dyakov said to the muzhik  and added softly and you were complaining my dearest of friends 
throwing his reins to his orderly the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and swirling off his operatic cloak disappeared into the headquarters 
today reading this story once again for the first time in fiftyfour years i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like ezra pound james joyce and thomas mann he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early s i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse 
my early connections to modernism and my later connections to marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early s converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on october  th at the cinema village in new york directed by david novack who has a background as a sound engineer it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of ukraine today as a possible trigger of wwiii according to some babels multiple identity as jew ukrainian communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering 
the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by andrei malaevbabel who is the grandson of isaac babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of florida to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work isaac babel was executed for treason in  having been charged with belonging to a trotskyist group and spying for france and austria babels wife antonina pirozhkova who died at the age of  in  is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in  the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new york times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering degree she helped to design the moscow subway system the obit notes 
ms pirozhkova recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading habits which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director sergei m eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like andré gide and andré malraux 
it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a stalin toady 
as he travels around ukraine malaevbabel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for odessa tales another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in  and  the stories focus on jewish gangsters living in moldavanka an odessa slum hardly the material youd expect to find written by a partisan of the russian revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to terences observation  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto  or i am human and nothing of that which is human is alien to me 
although i have never read odessa tales i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather louis proyect probably knew in byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the usa unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in sullivan county in upstate ny abe kid twist reles and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan lake about fifteen minutes from my home town 
throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by liev schreiber that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including stanford professor gregory freidin who spent a day traveling around paris with malaevbabel to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to russia we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of stalins countless victims by living in exile he was too attached to russian culture and language to live abroad 
while in paris babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on stalins shitlist although being a freethinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater background malaevbabel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina vlady an acclaimed russianfrench actress who reads a letter from the titular character 
in  gregory freidin mounted a production of maria at stanford university the plays program describes major character isaac dymshit a jewish gangster as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution she like the young babel served in the red cavalry 
never seen on stage we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it begins 
at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda division im in charge therei edit the articles of the divisional newspaper i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all ukrainians they remind me of italians the way they talk and act russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in petersburg opposite the hermitage and the winter palace we might as well have been living in polynesia for we knew any thing at all about our people 
it is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for france or austria 
babel was a friend and protégé of maxim gorky who remained a diehard stalinist despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of russian society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political corruption prosecution of the innocent and black marketeering within soviet society gorky accused babel of having a baudelairean predilection for rotting meat apparently gorky had forgotten that baudelaire was marxs favorite novelist 
david novack the director of finding babel has a connection to odessa but not to its legendary jewish gangsters he has an ancestor named david nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there 
in an interview given to the odessa review  novack sums up isaac babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the s that saw albert camus as its most eloquent spokesmen i never found myself comfortable with the trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the genius leader to this day it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that novacks description of babels insideroutsider sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left 
babel represented the insider outsider thats what he was he got himself all the way inside up to the upper levels of the nkvd up to beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end personally i dont know if he was in the room but he had an office in the st catharines monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture prison the sukhanovo prison which we note in the film we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider but yet he was an outsider because he was from odessa he was jewish he should not even have been permitted to study under gorky which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to st petersburg when he wasnt allowed to be there because it was outside the settlement area for jews so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red army running through western ukraine as he documented

Admin,2016-11-19T12:47:58.921+02:00,demonic possession today part,"according to john kaminski the new boss is the same as the old boss forget it if thats what you think kaminski says youre kidding yourself 
presidentelect donald trumps claim he is reinvestigating  is just so much meaningless hot air  more neocon crapola  if he intends to solve the greatest crime in american history by including two of the events participating perpetrators  rudy giuliani and lewis eisenberg  on his team of detectives 
what kind of truth can we expect from this kind of sandbagged scrutiny none at all once again our government is investigating itself with predictable results it will do no better than the first time  which was a total whitewash because it is the very system itself that all these political functionaries are trying to defend which bears responsibility for this event and its impact on history 
hiring the people who played minor supporting roles in the  bloodbath to identify its architects and actors may yield a few sacrificial scapegoats like cheney and some generals but the top of the line power structure will remain solidly in place hidden from view and utterly in control of world events 
that trump has surrounded himself with the tainted players who have carried out all these wars for israel augurs for a dark future in which the militarization of america will further shrink individual rights and the harsh crackdown on legitimate dissent  which will soon be banned  plainly signals the end of free speech as we have known it in the united states 
recall thomas jeffersons dictum freedom of the press cannot be limited without being lost today it is long gone the press prints only what the government allows it to print 
for trump to hire such rancid refugees from the bush administration means that he wont be investigating  instead he will be crafting a new more realistic coverup that lambastes saudi renegades and totally omits the overwhelming presence of israeli jews in all aspects of the tragedy  the same presence that now dominates the us government and its criminal activities throughout the world 
preemptive war is criminal activity in case you didnt know the us is practicing it everywhere under the cynical guise of fighting terror which it itself creates by hiring thugs from around the world to fit into the proper terror slots and become believable enemies for the press to vilify and our military to bomb 
the us has literally slaughtered millions of people around the world at the behest of a small group of mostly jewish men and the gentiles they have bought who control not only virtually all the money of the people in the world but also control their thoughts as a result 
mayor giuliani ran the command post in building  you remember building  that building that was knocked down by not being hit by an airplane giuliani knows everything that happened and who did what 
eisenberg one of the worlds foremost financiers was the head of the new york port authority who leased the twin towers to silverstein silverstein who spoke frequently with top israeli leaders wound up with  billion 
the question with regard to trumps integrity kind of splits down the middle since he seems to have a genuine desire to succeed and restore the peace but he is indebted to forces far larger than himself which he is now trying to placate by surrounding himself with the traditional pseudo republican goons like gingrich and romney 
if only they were genuine republicans it wouldnt be so bad but theyre poseurs all ultimately working for the rockefellers and the rothschilds 
business as usual in the jewish american empire gnawing on the fatted calf while   bleeds 
trumps choices reveal a desire to continue the swashbuckling sadism of the bush administration throughout his campaign i always shuddered when trump would proclaim that we needed a stronger military and i thought tell that to the people beneath the bombs because they want no part of any of this 
as a newspaper blows trivial events into earthshaking issues so politicians identify all manner of enemies that demonstrate the desperate need for them to be elected 
like the boston marathon bombing that turned a mercenary drill into a region wide suspension of freedom of movement the worst story possible is presented even as inconvenient facts are left behind 
think about the atrocities and false flag shockers that have been foisted on us since  statistics reveal that more than  of significant terror incidents began life as fbi sting operations manipulating low iq bigmouths into capital crimes 
why is it the cops can commit crimes against the people but the people cant commit crimes against the cops this is not the kind of freedom we thought wed get while growing up 
trump certainly is not addressing any of these issues and a trump administration will merely continue the clumsy depredations and smokescreen lies that have exemplified the utterly corrupt and criminal nature of the united states as it is run by jews bankers holed up in the city of london and wreaking havoc throughout the world by their control of everyones money 
what is really needed is a full accounting of what the jews have done to the united states and restitution to united states citizens over moneys illegally stolen by the federal reserve corporation to be taken from its stockholders immediately 
of course this is impossible because the jews own the government and all the corrupt minions within it one word from them and youre out of a job 
the avaricious jews are really only a reflection of the darker side of humanity like good sociopaths they learned everything they know by mimicking others and have become better than everyone else at what they do simply by practice and cooperation 
they have never once considered that the fate of the world ultimately depends on treating everyone in the world as members of your own family even as that becomes impossible on a continent overrun by hungry savages who were put there by these very same sadists who control the united states and its fearsome war machine

as a jew who has worked for years with steve bannon i can tell you he is not an antisemite or a white nationalist he doesnt have an antisemitic bone in his body  david horowitz jewish founder of the david horowitz freedom center and editor of frontpage magazine  
when presidentelect donald trump named steve bannon the controversial media figure behind the altright website breitbart news network as his senior strategist  major jewish groups raised the alarm 
the antidefamation league condemned the move saying bannons website was home to racists and fostered hatred against jews but to his jewish defenders  which include breitbarts ceo and senior editors for the site  he is an ally and proud zionist 
i can say without hesitation that steve is a friend of the jewish people and a defender of israel as well as being a passionate american patriot and a great leader joel pollak an orthodox jew and a senior editor for breitbart news wrote on monday 
indeed breitbarts origin story has its roots in israel according to larry solov breitbarts ceo and president another close jewish colleague of bannon 
in a november  post on breitbart news solov describes the conception of the news site in  it happened solov writes during a trip to israel with andrew breitbart the jewish founder and namesake of the website 
the site was born to defend the jewish state 
one thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically profreedom and proisrael solov wrote we were sick of the antiisrael bias of the mainstream media 
solov and breitbart were blown away by the spirit tenacity and resourcefulness of the israeli people on that trip solov wrote 
breitbart died in  and bannon became editor of the site 
under bannons leadership the site became one of the best known platforms and gateways for the altright a diverse group that traffics in white nationalism and racism richard spencer  a founder of the political movement who advocates for the creation of a white ethnostate called breitbart a gateway to altright ideas and writers 
during trumps campaign the site became particularly enamored with the republican candidate and lampooned and attacked his opponents 
for ben shapiro a former writer at breitbart news bannon betrayed the original vision of the sites founder 
andrew breitbart despised racism shapiro wrote on monday with bannon embracing trump all that changed now breitbart has become the altright goto website  pushing white ethnonationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers 
but even as the site may have appealed to antisemites it retained its zionist bona fides under bannon 
in  bannon launched a jerusalem branch of breitbart news which covers events in israel it is edited by israelbased american reporter aaron klein another bannon advocate klein a yeshiva university graduate is also a columnist for the jewish press a weekly newspaper with a conservative bent 
klein recently called the antitrump protests across the country a product of professional agitators who are seeking the downfall of the us capitalist system 
the activist pamela geller known for her antiislamic campaigning also counts herself among bannons jewish allies on twitter geller defended bannon recently dismissing those who were characterizing bannon as an antisemite 
he partnered with breitbart  a jew she wrote he partnered with larry solov after breitbart died a jew he worked with me  a jew then she added zionist 
david horowitz founder of the conservative think tank david horowitz freedom center also came to bannons defense saying bannon does not have an antisemitic bone in his body 
as a jew who has worked for years with steve bannon horowitz wrote in an email to the forward i can tell you he is not an antisemite or a white nationalist ld  for further proof that steve bannon is not going to do anything to challenge jewish power in america or stand up to israel see this thoughtprovoking article in the occidental observer  antisemitism as political assassination the smearing of steve bannon i really do feel at this stage though of course i could be wrong that diehard antisemites and ardent white nationalists are most unlikely to see any of their dreams come true in the foreseeable future thats what makes antisemites and white nationalists the angriest people on earth their dreams are constantly being shattered as they see the jews becoming more powerful and tyrannical at their expense constant defeat leaves a bitter taste in the mouth like this share it now",english,darkmoon.me,No Image URL,bs,far worse fourth reich day reckoning arrived,steve bannon donalds trumps chief strategist senior counselor jew worked years steve bannon tell antisemite white nationalist doesnt antisemitic bone body david horowitz jewish founder david horowitz freedom center editor frontpage magazine presidentelect donald trump named steve bannon controversial media figure behind altright website breitbart news network senior strategist major jewish groups raised alarm antidefamation league condemned move saying bannons website home racists fostered hatred jews jewish defenders include breitbarts ceo senior editors site ally proud zionist say without hesitation steve friend jewish people defender israel well passionate american patriot great leader joel pollak orthodox jew senior editor breitbart news wrote monday indeed breitbarts origin story roots israel according larry solov breitbarts ceo president another close jewish colleague bannon november post breitbart news solov describes conception news site happened solov writes trip israel andrew breitbart jewish founder namesake website site born defend jewish state one thing specifically discussed night desire start site would unapologetically profreedom proisrael solov wrote sick antiisrael bias mainstream media solov breitbart blown away spirit tenacity resourcefulness israeli people trip solov wrote breitbart died bannon became editor site bannons leadership site became one best known platforms gateways altright diverse group traffics white nationalism racism richard spencer founder political movement advocates creation white ethnostate called breitbart gateway altright ideas writers trumps campaign site became particularly enamored republican candidate lampooned attacked opponents ben shapiro former writer breitbart news bannon betrayed original vision sites founder andrew breitbart despised racism shapiro wrote monday bannon embracing trump changed breitbart become altright goto website pushing white ethnonationalism legitimate response political correctness comment section turning cesspool white supremacist mememakers even site may appealed antisemites retained zionist bona fides bannon bannon launched jerusalem branch breitbart news covers events israel edited israelbased american reporter aaron klein another bannon advocate klein yeshiva university graduate also columnist jewish press weekly newspaper conservative bent klein recently called antitrump protests across country product professional agitators seeking downfall us capitalist system activist pamela geller known antiislamic campaigning also counts among bannons jewish allies twitter geller defended bannon recently dismissing characterizing bannon antisemite partnered breitbart jew wrote partnered larry solov breitbart died jew worked jew added zionist david horowitz founder conservative think tank david horowitz freedom center also came bannons defense saying bannon antisemitic bone body jew worked years steve bannon horowitz wrote email forward tell antisemite white nationalist ld proof steve bannon going anything challenge jewish power america stand israel see thoughtprovoking article occidental observer antisemitism political assassination smearing steve bannon really feel stage though course could wrong diehard antisemites ardent white nationalists unlikely see dreams come true foreseeable future thats makes antisemites white nationalists angriest people earth dreams constantly shattered see jews becoming powerful tyrannical expense constant defeat leaves bitter taste mouth like share,1,,,,,

us republican presidential nominee donald trump says hillary clintons policy towards syria would lead to world war iii arguing that the democratic nominee would drag the us into an armed confrontation with russia 
trump made the warning in an interview with reuters on tuesday following clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones in syria earlier this month 
what we should do is focus on isil daesh we should not be focusing on syria trump said 
youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton he said 
on october  the democratic nominee said a nofly zone was required inside the warravaged country to stabilize fighting a move that was opposed in congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with russia since a usenforced nofly zone would mean the us could shoot down russian fighter jets should they enter syrian airspace 
clinton also described the situation in syria as incredibly complex since the intervention of russia us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton speaks at an early vote rally at broward college in coconut creek florida on october   
youre not fighting syria anymore youre fighting syria russia and iran all right russia is a nuclear country but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk trump said 
the republican nominee also referred to the removal of syrian president bashar alassad from power as a secondlevel priority to defeating daesh 
assad is secondary to me to isil trump said 
russia might down us planes 
meanwhile us director of national intelligence james clapper also warned about the consequences of clintons push for a nofly zone in syria that could spark a conflict with russia 
speaking at the council on foreign relations clapper said clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone in syria could lead to russia shooting down american planes there james clapper the us director of national intelligence speaks at the council of foreign relations on october   in new york city 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they  if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground he said 
i take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they  why they did that clapper said of russian weapons recently deployed to syria the system they have there is a very advanced airdefense system its very capable and i dont think theyd do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it 
during the third and final presidential debate last week clinton reiterated her remarks on a nofly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in syria 
a foreignbacked militancy has been going on in syria since march  with a plethora of armed groups  each supported by one foreign country or another  fighting the assad government 
since  the united states along with a number of its allies has been leading a socalled antiterror campaign in syria and neighboring iraq 
instead of helping to rein in the takfiri terrorists the air raids have killed many civilians and caused extensive damage to the countrys infrastructure 
iran has been offering syria advisory military help russia another syrian ally has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in syria at a request from damascus

many neuroscientists estimate that as much as  of all brain activity is unconscious just think about that for a second   
all that unconscious activity is influenced heavily by the world around its subconscious cues to demonstrate that were going to call on a super cool quiz the premise is simple only geniuses and schizophrenics can answer the following three questions which one are you continue to find out 
there are no hints you either know it or you dont 
the test youve just done relies on what researchers call the contraposition method this method tests the extent of a persons awareness and brain processing power its a super complicated method with tons of moving parts so to speak but heres what you need to know for the purpose of this article there are objects which one can reasonably say are unrelated most people would assume for example that a race car and a hurricane have very little connection a genius who thinks outside of the box however would deduce some sort of connection a schizophrenic patient would also deduce a connection because of the way the illness makes people see nonexistent connections in just about everything in other words if the quiz in this article left you scratching your head youre normal if not one of two things is true  youre brilliant or you have schizophrenia 
dont worry i wont leave you guessing here are some facts that will help you figure out which one you are geniuses will have taken their time to think before blurting a response did you get the answers right what do you think  are you a schizophrenic or a genius as far as the schizophrenia angle goes this post is not a diagnostic tool it can get you thinking about schizophrenia and if you have concerns you can see a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank  via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states  thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january   another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true  snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on   the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushes plan on getting out of the country as well

for anyone who has heard about but not yet had a chance to learn the details about the undercover operation produced by james okeefe s project veritas about the inner workings of the democrat party youre in luck i have written two different posts covering the subject from different angles and this will be the third covering hillarys response each post include at least some if not all of the undercover recordings released so far by james okeefe  
for over a year okeefe risked his life by going deep undercover into the democrat partys factory of corruption and just this week after everyone laughed at trump for calling the election rigged okeefe began releasing portions of the shocking video he took while undercover in the videos some of the highest ranking members of the dnc make some of the most jawdropping admissions of guilt youve ever heard in your lives not the least of which is we have a call with hillarys campaign every day to go over what areas need more focus 
in the first post i wrote titled george soros master blueprint to conquer the west gets caught on camera  i go into detail about how the money funding all the illegal operations caught on film comes from hillary clinton s largest donor none other than george soros  one very high ranking democratic operative explains what happens with the money once it comes in upon receipt 
the campaign hillary clinton campaign pays the dnc the dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group and the foval group goes and executes the sh on the ground 
wow then when questioned about the legality the response was 
it doesnt matter what the friggin legal and ethics people say we need to win this motherfker 
thats just the beginning the evidence gets infinitely worse then in the second post i wrote titled this video guarantees a trump win even with hillarys fraud machine  i present an honest look at both candidates and how they operate the post contains  of the released undercover footage so far so you learn exactly who is prescribing what to whom and i assure you that nothing can prepare you for what james managed to catch on film youll be sick 
then i contrast the criminal enterprise hillary is running with a montage of videos taken over a  year span of donald trump  and in each of the clips spanning all those years trump is asked about potentially running for the presidency some day some of the answers are  years old and all are spontaneous unlike the scripted and now we know totally false statements we consistently get from hillary it is painfully obvious the answers trump gives are genuine and from the heart 
love him or hate him good luck arguing that trump isnt authentic in the video you get a good look at who would be in the oval office and its not the caricature that team hillary has tried so hard to create on the other hand team hillarys behavior is utterly indefensible and she knows it which is why she runs like hell in the video below the second reporters begin to ask her about the recordings 
theres nowhere to run now though hillary you and your staff have a lot to answer for much of which is criminal in nature go figure

tony podesta  brother of the nowdisgraced hillary clinton campaign chair john podesta  whose files wikileaks has been publishing  is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia 
no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth 
in  john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest 
according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account 
at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight 
for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations 
john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign 
tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign 
think about that for a moment 
one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities 
as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund 
the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution 
notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict 
additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders 
hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising 
i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon 
to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added 
responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama 
as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds 
where do we draw the line though 
elias suggests a particularly intricate solution 
if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically 
put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen 
as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground 
mook eventually decides plainly 
marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that

project hemisphere a secretive program developed by att searches trillions of call records in order to analyze cell phone data spying on the activity of private individuals in order to identify who they are speaking with and why as well as gps tracking on the location of each individual connected to the call and it transmits this information to the department of justice doj 
in  project hemisphere was shown in a powerpoint presentation produced by the drug enforcement administration the new york times reported this as a partnership between att and the doj primarily deployed for drugenforcement taskforces all information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the doj 
att specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the doj who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers using the taxpayers own money to spy on their every move this is an invasion of privacy without a warrant this is a federal spy program by proxy working through corporations 
att promises law enforcement that it will not disclose project hemispheres involvement in active investigations that are made public att is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network 
while it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private 
news flash its never been private they have always wanted to use your information as a product to sell to the highest bidder your data is their product and you are paying them to take it from you

the bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily its not a question of trump it is an imperative that hillary be defeated if the people choose hillary then they must and will be punished wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood by john hayward breitbart  october   
in a speech bill clinton gave at the home of mehul and hema sanghani in october  revealed to the public for the first time by wikileaks former president bill clinton touted hillary clintons working relationship with the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi in egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillspresident clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures 
finally we live in a world as i said thats full of good news and bad news the united states cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening you cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way even the people who dont like the iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions hillary negotiated those sanctions and got china and russia to sign off  something i thought shed never be able to do i confess im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race 
and when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world 
and when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president medvedev she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get  votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get  votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that 
youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than bill clinton boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree 
mr clintons version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip 
but the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling hillary clintons working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us  pressure  were used to secure morsis office as well 
then again in public pronouncements clinton called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door 
a few days ago declassified state department documents revealed clintons talking points for a  meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs 
clinton was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly 
after morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long 
as for clintons superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from clinton to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system  
egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of hillary clintons support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the  us presidential election therefore a prospective president hillary clinton probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state hillary clintons appalling lapses in judgment

tony podesta  brother of the nowdisgraced hillary clinton campaign chair john podesta  whose files wikileaks has been publishing  is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia 
no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth 
in  john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest 
according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account 
at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight 
for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations 
john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign 
tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign 
think about that for a moment 
one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities 
as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund 
the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution 
notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict 
additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders 
hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising 
i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon 
to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added 
responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama 
as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds 
where do we draw the line though 
elias suggests a particularly intricate solution 
if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically 
put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen 
as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground 
mook eventually decides plainly 
marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that 
all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect  despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime  the us approved a stunning  billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november  
tony podestas specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn  million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine 
saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post  that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying 
that broader audience  the american public  has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well 
as the free thought project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee hillary clintons campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable  including no less than  socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign 
although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house  who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts

Chris Menahan,2016-10-27T13:22:10.427+03:00,watch hillary aide rushes to her side to help her climb one step,"the american medical association defines an alcoholic as someone who has a prolonged period of frequent heavy alcohol use is unable to control drinking once it has begun has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects has a variety of social andor legal problems arising from alcohol use 
by that definition hillary clinton is an alcoholic  exhibit a 
in an email to hillarys campaign chairman john podesta on august   director of communications for hillarys campaign jennifer palmieri wrote referring to hillary 
i think you should call her and sober her up some 
heres a screenshot of the email released by wikileaks  exhibit b 
on feb   hillarys spokesman nick merrill sent an email presumably to hillarys campaign staff with the subject hrc clips news clips on hillary rodham clinton the news clips that day included an article by benjamin bell for abc news titled one thing that might surprise you about hillary clinton which merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email 
bells article was an interview with new york times national political reporter amy chozick on whether hillary clinton would announce shes running for the presidency one of the questions bell asked chozick was covering hillary clinton what is one thing that has surprised you about her 
chozick answered 
hmm she likes to drink we were on the campaign trail in  and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in pennsylvania um no 
heres a composite screenshot of the relevant part of merrills email from wikileaks  exhibit c 
according to the national enquirer  top staffers of hillarys campaign told the enquirer they even began this years presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for hillary but any rehab therapy quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign and the effort of making a deal over an fbi probe into her email scandal 
a source said the stress of her political career the neverending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a lifethreatening booze hell she turned to drink to drown her fears hillary tries to hide her problem like she lies about so many things a close friend of hillary added  hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater bill shes also hit the bottle to cope with other stress as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was secretary of state 
one hillary insider told the enquirer that hillary has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done  and that shes not fit to be president 
certainly hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman see below because no sane person in her then position as us secretary of state would behave like this in public

these were found on the phone that was used by anthony weiner and huma abedin he said why was that phone not looked at originally 
there could be one explanation huma abedin may have denied that any other phone existed and if she did she committed a felony she lied to the fbi just like general cartwright and if she did shes dead meat and comey knows it and theres nothing he can do about it 
digenova continued and why this letter was sent today was very simple the agents came to comey yesterday they told him about the evidence and he said oh s and realized that his goose was cooked that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent and he knew that the agents running the weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress 
and ive also been told something very significant its been reported that those laptops belonging to clinton aides cheryl mills and heather samuelson were destroyed they were not and the reason is the fbi agents refused to do it 
digenova went on to say he believes there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now 
he sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau he said comey sent this letter today because he had to he has no moral authority inside the agency right now hes a joke hes a laughingstock of the agency and among former fbi agents he has become an anathema

Claire Bernish,2016-10-27T13:22:12.612+03:00,brother of clintons campaign chair is an active foreign agent on the saudi arabian payroll,"posted on october   by isaac davis 
the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

Tonya Parnell,2016-10-30T12:06:18.987+02:00,comment on former us attorney for dc new hillary email probe was result of revolt inside fbi by tonya parnell,"posted on october   by the free thought project 
decadeold audio exposes thensenator hillary clinton saying the us should have manipulated palestinian parliamentary elections in  to prevent a hamas victory the presidential candidate lamented that the us didnt determine who was going to win 
i do not think we should have pushed for an election in the palestinian territories i think that was a big mistake thennew york senator clinton told the jewish press a new yorkbased weekly newspaper several months after the january election 
and if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win she said 
until friday the comment clinton made on september   only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist eli chomsky an editor and a staff writer for the jewish press he interviewed clinton at the newspapers office in brooklyn 
chomsky who shared and played the tape for the observer says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with clinton during which the palestinian parliamentary election was among primary topics the comments have been posted on soundcloud 
speaking to the news portal he recalled being confused by the fact that anyone could support the idea  offered by a national political leader no less  that the us should be in the business of fixing foreign elections  audio emerges of clinton proposing election rigging in palestine censored by israeli press for past  years httpstcolsmycuzjr 
 wikileaks wikileaks october   
the interview took place nine months after the hamas movement claimed  of the  parliamentary seats pushing aside the usfavored fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet that victory was neither welcomed in israel nor in the us in washington where hamas is considered a terrorist organization officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a palestinian authority that included hamas 
thenpresident george w bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the power of democracy but refused to deal with hamas as long as it opposed israels existence and espoused violence 
that day in september  clinton made odd and controversial comments all now saved on the minute record that chomsky held onto all these years 
i went to my bosses at the time chomsky told the observer the jewish press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody  even a direct quote from anyone  in a position of influence because they might need them down the road my bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time i was convinced that it was and i held onto it all these years dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",english,dcclothesline.com,http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Pipeline-KW-1-600x314.jpg,bs,hillary unpopular pay youth voters fabricate rallies,home search posted pamela geller clintons emailed aid us state department jake sullivan used personal email talk clinton bringing libya unsecured servers open see hillarys leadership libya led prior february day rage libya national budget surplus percent gdp oil production million barrels per day track reach goal million barrels per day currently oil production decreased percent following revolution libyan economy contracted estimated percent national deficit percent gdp revolution libya secure prospering secular islamic country critical ally providing intelligence terrorist activity postseptember qaddafi longer threat united states yet secretary state hillary clinton strongly advocated succeeded convincing administration support libyan rebels nofly zone intended prevent possible humanitarian disaster turned quickly allout war huma abedin human network graph based wikileaks clinton emails courtesy pamela geller dont forget follow dc clothesline facebook twitter please help spread word sharing articles favorite social networks share,1,,,,,
Isaac Davis,2016-10-30T12:29:21.111+02:00,this is the man militarized police at standing rock are working for,"if you signed up for obamacare youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up and opted to pay the penalties  youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up didnt pay penalties and stuck with your original insurance company youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up didnt pay penalties and paid cash for medical care youve been screwed 
every person in america has been affected regardless of what you did or did not do 
thats because the affordable care act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country in the mere span of  years the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages meanwhile medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices making it nearly impossible to pay outofpocket for care 
and these premiums they are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine some families pay  a month for  coverage after they pay the  deductible thats nearly  per year before obamacare pays for a penny of their costs 
and nownow that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the exchange medical costs are skyrocketing doctors wont see patients who arent covered employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit and people lost their jobs due to obamacare costs 
the whole thing is failing even president obama has admitted it  and now we have proof that it was planned that way 
but that isnt the worst of it the worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered theyll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not theyll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines 
one of the recent wikileaks shows that hillary clinton knew this and was complicit 
melissa dykes of the daily sheeple wrote  
in an email thread dated september   between hillary and her senior policy adviser ann oleary titled memo on cadillac tax for hrc hillary wrote given the politics now w bipartisan support including schumer ill support repeal w sense of the senate that revenues would have to be found id be open to a range of options to do that but we have to be careful that the r version passes which begins the unraveling of the aca  
which begins the unraveling of the affordable care act 
a democrat supporting republican legislation to destroy obamacare on purpose how many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the american people for in obamacare penalties because they cant afford the affordable health care and the american people will look at this like a victory when it does unravel even though it has been the plan all along 
hillary clinton that savior of woman and children knew that this would fail  she is supporting the legislation to destroy it leaving everyone in america at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the alreadystruggling middle class 
mark my words as bad as this disaster is it is only going to get worse watch this video for the full story

The Free Thought Project,2016-10-30T13:12:36.265+02:00,leaked audio catches clinton redhanded talking about rigging elections,"posted by tim brown 
on monday a man who voted for donald trump was arrested for wearing a tshirt that referenced hillary clinton s comments about trump supporters being  deplorables  to the polls 
brett mauthe  was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a protrump hat and a shirt that read  basket of deplorables  
according to ksat  mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls however since the tshirt did not violate the election code he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it 
subsequently he was arrested and charged with electioneering 
ksat  reports  
bulverde police chief gary haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details instead he deferred to comal countys election coordinator cynthia jaqua 
jaqua said the offense of electioneering isnt limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs violations can be committed by voters as well 
it can mean a tshirt a button a hat you know she said anything related to the voting the party the candidate 
jaqua declined to release specific details about mauthes arrest 
jaqua is quoted by my san antonio  
its in the election code electioneering is prohibited within a foot marker you cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons tshirts hats whatever else or carrying signs she said 
most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail she added 
every election we have to advise people even if its a school bond issue they wear candidates shirts and we just have to remind them please go into the restroom and turn it inside out this is the first time i recall someone getting arrested she said during two decades working at the county election office 
a gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for trump and when i asked him to please take it off he was real nice and took it off she added while working a polling site thursday afternoon in new braunfels 
so according to this nonsense a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day this is utterly ridiculous 
my question on all of that is what happened to free speech is that recognized as a godgiven right in the first amendment i mean i realize that the constitution is to restrict the federal government but honestly shouldnt the states recognize the right of free speech even in a polling place seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected 
other voters agree with me 
i dont feel like you should be preaching to anybody but i do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate georgina pereida said after casting her vote im kind of shocked because i think thats part of the freedoms that were voting for 
jose tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are  and vote again i ask why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech its not inflammatory it isnt a lie it isnt slander whats illegal about it 
ill tell you politicians want to control people and this is one of many means they use to do that this is what happens when you dont hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose 
mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media 
the reason im not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around and i dont want to give you any comment he said  
the charged of electioneering is a class c misdemeanor

additionally when she had her iowa kickoff event a whopping  people showed up  the majority of those were reporters 
hillary clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid antiamerican liberals and even then it looks like shes having to pay them to actually do anything to support her in other words her candidacy is completely contrived

Pamela Geller,2016-10-30T13:42:09.328+02:00,clintons most emailed aid in the us state department jake sullivan used personal email to talk with clinton about bringing down libya,"isaac davis 
the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

Tim Brown,2016-10-30T18:59:00.000+02:00,texas police arrest trump voter for wearing deplorable tshirt,"posted on october   by tim brown 
on monday a man who voted for donald trump was arrested for wearing a tshirt that referenced hillary clinton s comments about trump supporters being  deplorables  to the polls 
brett mauthe  was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a protrump hat and a shirt that read  basket of deplorables  
according to ksat  mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls however since the tshirt did not violate the election code he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it 
subsequently he was arrested and charged with electioneering 
ksat  reports  
bulverde police chief gary haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details instead he deferred to comal countys election coordinator cynthia jaqua 
jaqua said the offense of electioneering isnt limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs violations can be committed by voters as well 
it can mean a tshirt a button a hat you know she said anything related to the voting the party the candidate 
jaqua declined to release specific details about mauthes arrest 
jaqua is quoted by my san antonio  
its in the election code electioneering is prohibited within a foot marker you cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons tshirts hats whatever else or carrying signs she said 
most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail she added 
every election we have to advise people even if its a school bond issue they wear candidates shirts and we just have to remind them please go into the restroom and turn it inside out this is the first time i recall someone getting arrested she said during two decades working at the county election office 
a gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for trump and when i asked him to please take it off he was real nice and took it off she added while working a polling site thursday afternoon in new braunfels 
so according to this nonsense a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day this is utterly ridiculous 
my question on all of that is what happened to free speech is that recognized as a godgiven right in the first amendment i mean i realize that the constitution is to restrict the federal government but honestly shouldnt the states recognize the right of free speech even in a polling place seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected 
other voters agree with me 
i dont feel like you should be preaching to anybody but i do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate georgina pereida said after casting her vote im kind of shocked because i think thats part of the freedoms that were voting for 
jose tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are  and vote again i ask why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech its not inflammatory it isnt a lie it isnt slander whats illegal about it 
ill tell you politicians want to control people and this is one of many means they use to do that this is what happens when you dont hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose 
mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media 
the reason im not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around and i dont want to give you any comment he said  
the charged of electioneering is a class c misdemeanor

DL,2016-10-31T02:35:28.428+02:00,comment on hillary is so unpopular she has to pay off youth voters and fabricate her rallies by dl,"the american medical association defines an alcoholic as someone who has a prolonged period of frequent heavy alcohol use is unable to control drinking once it has begun has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects has a variety of social andor legal problems arising from alcohol use 
by that definition hillary clinton is an alcoholic  exhibit a 
in an email to hillarys campaign chairman john podesta on august   director of communications for hillarys campaign jennifer palmieri wrote referring to hillary 
i think you should call her and sober her up some 
heres a screenshot of the email released by wikileaks  exhibit b 
on feb   hillarys spokesman nick merrill sent an email presumably to hillarys campaign staff with the subject hrc clips news clips on hillary rodham clinton the news clips that day included an article by benjamin bell for abc news titled one thing that might surprise you about hillary clinton which merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email 
bells article was an interview with new york times national political reporter amy chozick on whether hillary clinton would announce shes running for the presidency one of the questions bell asked chozick was covering hillary clinton what is one thing that has surprised you about her 
chozick answered 
hmm she likes to drink we were on the campaign trail in  and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in pennsylvania um no 
heres a composite screenshot of the relevant part of merrills email from wikileaks  exhibit c 
according to the national enquirer  top staffers of hillarys campaign told the enquirer they even began this years presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for hillary but any rehab therapy quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign and the effort of making a deal over an fbi probe into her email scandal 
a source said the stress of her political career the neverending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a lifethreatening booze hell she turned to drink to drown her fears hillary tries to hide her problem like she lies about so many things a close friend of hillary added  hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater bill shes also hit the bottle to cope with other stress as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was secretary of state 
one hillary insider told the enquirer that hillary has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done  and that shes not fit to be president 
certainly hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman see below because no sane person in her then position as us secretary of state would behave like this in public

hawkmo99,2016-10-31T02:35:34.486+02:00,comment on this is the man militarized police at standing rock are working for by hawkmo,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
cannon ball nd  on thursday police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry pepper spray mace a number of atvs five tanks two helicopters and militaryequipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters armed with  nothing 
under orders from the nownotorious morton county sheriffs office this ridiculously heavyhanded standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas 
but the target of their operation  a group of slightly more than  native american water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the dakota access pipeline  never intended to do battle with the armed taxpayerfunded corporatebacked statesponsored aggressors 
reports vary but no less than  people were arrested thursday and  according to witnesses  police marked numbers on arrestees arms and housed them in cementfloored dog kennels  without any padding before they were transported as far away as fargo 
it goes back to concentration camp days asserted ocetisakowin coordinator mekasi camphorinek who along with his mother was marked and detained in a mesh kennel reports the los angeles times  
although thursdays incident remained relatively peaceful for some time with only shouts chants and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider clashes nonetheless broke out  solely because of gratuitous police aggression 
after facing off for a couple hours these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the treaty of  camp  in reference to the fort laramie treaty of that year which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively native american territory not to be disturbed by the us government prior to his arrest camphorinek had established the camp stating as cited by indigenous rising  
today the oceti sakowin has enacted eminent domain on dapl lands claiming  treaty rights this is unceded land highway  as of this point is blockaded we will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped we need bodies and we need people who are trained in nonviolent direct action we are still staying nonviolent and we are still staying peaceful 
despite the water protectors commitment to nonviolence the militarized police response went as would be expected  horribly awry 
a prayer circle of elders including several women was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road stated a press release from indigenous environment network a tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it a group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline thrown to the ground and arrested 
claims to the contrary by morton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier aside native american and indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience 
no matter how peacefully the opposition acts armed defenders of big oil interests seem determined to brutalize  disrespect and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come 
in fact at the beginning of september a private security firm hired by energy transfer partners the company responsible for pipeline construction indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors press and supporters  for reasons as yet unknown 
during the savage attack a pregnant woman young girl and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs handlers afterward a warrant for inciting a riot was issued democracy now journalist amy goodman  for doing her job filming events as they happened  though charges were subsequently thrown out 
although etp and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries the guardian now reports that  because the guards lacked proper licensing  they could now face criminal charges on wednesday the morton county sheriffs office made the determination that dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of north dakota 
bob frost owner of ohiobased frost kennels told the guardian  all the proper protocols  were already done i pulled my guys out the next day because we werent there to go to war with these protesters 
frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident  but the sheriffs department disagrees seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early september allegedly in response to reports of trespassers but according to the guardian  police have only managed to identify two people 
the sheriffs department claims frost has not provided necessary information and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work  however because of the protest events the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control 
in a statement cited by the guardian  morton county captain jay gruebele said although lists of security employees have been provided there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld 
water protectors in the meantime are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence  and the altogether unacceptable disrespectful and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights 
as lakota country times editor brandon ecoffey wrote in an editorial thursday 
over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by morton county law enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the american constitution water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police people are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes and police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the

question had thethcentury founding fathers like their thcentury christian colonial predecessors established government and society upon yahwehs moral law including biblical qualifications for civil leaders would any of those in crime hills den of thieves donkeys and elephants alike be in office today 
answer of course not 
consequently there must be a definitive moment in americas history when her christian character and biblical course were formally altered that point was in  when the constitutional framers replaced the thcentury colonials governments of by and for god established upon his immutable moral law for their own humanistic government of by and for the people based upon capricious manmade enlightenment and masonic traditions

Jonathan Brooks,2016-10-31T03:54:14.559+02:00,comment on hillary clinton is an alcoholic by jonathan brooks,"posted on october   by daisy luther 
oh loretta 
ill bet that ag loretta lynch is shaking in her boots right now because when hillary clinton goes down lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates 
loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to  when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president barack obama  heres her official bio  
in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder  who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton 
it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton  the washington post reported 
clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation 
lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said 
lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public 
of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets 
now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton  
on june   attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting 
republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment 
last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported 
attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  
it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue 
as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison 
how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails 
now even the mainstream media cant turn its head 
earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up 
the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections 
how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno 
poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  
she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated 
she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom 
the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements 
the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat 
every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her 
but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact 
attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads 
the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation  
i wonder if shell make that same promise this time 
she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation 
i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out

marlene,2016-10-31T09:57:43.209+02:00,comment on congress attorney general lynch pleads fifth on secret iran ransom payments by marlene,"daisy luther 
according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize 
hillarys campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me as for the complaints from hrc they just make her sound like the outoftouch moneygrabbing powerhungry deceitful",english,dcclothesline.com,http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lynch-600x320.png,bs,comment french political leader france enter holy war islam embrace christianity never accept religion satan paulus,project veritas project veritas action released sixth video multipart series sending shockwaves dnc clinton campaign new video released project veritas action pva journalist exposes pay play robert creamer landed meeting bradley beychock president media matters america organization attacking james okeefe years meeting beychock gave pva journalist tour offices also proudly boasted media matters assault conservative writer political consultant roger stone watch courtesy information liberation dont forget follow dc clothesline facebook twitter please help spread word sharing articles favorite social networks share,1,,,,,
Truth Detector,2016-10-31T12:28:27.453+02:00,comment on if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her by truth detector,"posted by michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

Ann Tenna,2016-10-31T12:54:58.827+02:00,comment on ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation by ann tenna,"posted by david risselada 
much to the surprise of the american electorate both on the right and left the fbi is reopening its investigation into hillary clintons email scandal  whether this will amount to anything meaningful or it is simply a distraction is any bodys guess many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause president obama to cancel the elections  in my recent article corrupting ones self is the ultimate morality in the pursuit of utopia i discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change this idea of course is based on the writings of alinsky and other social engineers skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation looking at it from this perspective cancelled elections are a possibility the truth is with hillary clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an ends justify the means mentality and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized america move forward 
according to elizabeth harrington from the washington free beacon the clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with communists dictators like stalin and mao she believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives the goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating hillary clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring always blaming everything on a vast right wing conspiracy 
this has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers todays millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of jews murdered by adolph hitler they may not however know that hitler murdered more than jews he started by eliminating the sick and disabled then he murdered christians homosexuals and anyone else essentially that didnt go along with his national socialism the belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view this explains the hostility towards todays conservative movement they have been branded as fascists when in fact the truth is the exact opposite on the true political scale national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism which represents complete state control but it is still way left of center a true extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything with this being said and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like hillary clinton they pretend to be something they are not 
millions of young people in america due to left wing indoctrination in our universities  are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair compassionate system of economics left wing professors refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of  people under communist controlled governments communists believing not in god but in evolution and science believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact a sign of mental deficiency therefore it is justifiable to eliminate them to understand this read brainwashing a synthesis of the russian textbook on psychopolitics communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being 
the black book of communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both communism and nazism adolf hitler despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were he set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else this isnt any different than the goals of communism truthfully only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale using the economic class issue as opposed to race while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself the communists on the other hand as mentioned above pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice while in realitythey are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that dont go along with their agenda this according to the black book of communism makes the communist ideology if you could really assign degrees of evil more evil than nazism because of its deceptive nature 
we all know hillary clinton is a liar and she wrote her college thesis on saul alinsky but do we know anything else about her given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average american and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share she has referred to many of us as irredeemable deplorables in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed in fact this is the whole strategy of the democrat party because as we all know they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most americans they will however pretend to in order to get in office what are her intentions if she were to assume office are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government looking at the deceptive nature of hillary clinton and the violent nature of the left it sure seems like a distinct possibility 
the number of deaths under communist regimes from the black book of communism soviet union vladimr lenin and joseph stalin million deaths chinamao  million deaths vietnam ho chi mihn  million deaths north korea  million deaths cambodia pol pot  million deaths eastern europe  million deaths latin america  deaths africa  million deaths afghanistan under soviet control  million deaths 
these are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality i guess the question remains is man capable of bringing about a perfect society

Michael Snyder,2016-10-31T13:12:38.048+02:00,will michelle obama be the replacement nominee if the fbi email investigation ends hillary clintons campaign,"posted by daisy luther 
according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize

David Risselada,2016-10-31T13:12:47.326+02:00,the deceptive nature of hillary clinton is right in line with communism,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and

Daisy Luther,2016-10-31T13:12:49.690+02:00,ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation,"posted on october   by daisy luther 
oh loretta 
ill bet that ag loretta lynch is shaking in her boots right now because when hillary clinton goes down lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates 
loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to  when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president barack obama  heres her official bio  
in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder  who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton 
it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton  the washington post reported 
clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation 
lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said 
lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public 
of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets 
now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton  
on june   attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting 
republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment 
last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported 
attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  
it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue 
as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison 
how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails 
now even the mainstream media cant turn its head 
earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up 
the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections 
how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno 
poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  
she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated 
she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom 
the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements 
the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat 
every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her 
but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact 
attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads 
the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation  
i wonder if shell make that same promise this time 
she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation 
i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out

Theodore Shoebat,2016-10-31T13:12:52.632+02:00,french political leader france is about to enter a holy war with islam  embrace christianity never accept the religion of satan,"posted by michael snyder 
in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life 
i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both 
if hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life 
i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through 
as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe 
of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation 
at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not 
either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said 
but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi 
many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled  guilty as sin  
the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 
he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 
so what happens next 
in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump 
however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day 
in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th 
once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible 
if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be 
in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past 
this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure 
the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead 
it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale

Claire Bernish,2016-10-31T13:12:55.637+02:00,report exposes inner workings of facebook and how clinton loyalists control your newsfeed,"posted on october   by nathaniel mauka 
congress overwhelmingly voted for the patriot act nearly  years ago and our civil liberties have never been the same since as if this singular bill passed by george w bush wasnt invasive enough allowing big banks to demand our internet data and more  the cybersecurity information sharing act  cisa  makes cyberspying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it a forgone conclusion 
as with most shadow government legislation the cybersecurity information sharing act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances cisa was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will it also allows companies to mine data under the auspices of governmentcreated urgency 
the mere fact that this act passed in late  is monumental since it has been before congress in different forms for over a decade  the election seems to have offered the perfect cover as americans and activists were too busy arguing over trump vs hillary 
scott talbott senior vice president of government relations at the electronic transactions association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of cyber threats outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties talbott states  
the value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread he said before cisa corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage cisa allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy 
who exactly would be determining if someone is a threat is the meat of the sandwich though cisa is ripe for abuse just as the patriot act has been 
the patriot act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people without probable cause  to enter their homes or even to strip search them before theyve been to court had the opportunity to argue a case or given authorities a motive for this type of interrogation 
the stated purpose of the patriot act was to deter terrorist acts in the united states but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country cisa simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law 
more importantly who specifically is cisa targeting after multiple hackers have infiltrated computer systems at the white house  the state department  the pentagon  and the office of personnel management along with the democratic national committee  and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal is the shadow government simply trying to create a stopgap before their most elusive yet damning information is made public 
cisa certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the national security agency nsa before former nsa contractor edward snowden exposed it 
i think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start said justin harvey cso of fidelis cybersecurity adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill  to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur  will result 
under the guise of sharing cyber threats cisa allows companies to wholesalecollect information that may not even be a threat  and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is indeed a threat if this sounds like circular logic  it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill its justifications for entering every possible orifice for datagathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket

Daisy Luther,2016-10-31T13:12:59.920+02:00,if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her,"michael snyder 
in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life 
i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both 
if hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life 
i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through 
as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe 
of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation 
at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not 
either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said 
but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi 
many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled  guilty as sin  
the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 
he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 
so what happens next 
in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump 
however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day 
in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th 
once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible 
if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be 
in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past 
this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure 
the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead 
it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale

Michael Snyder,2016-10-31T13:13:00.664+02:00,if hillary clinton is charged with obstruction of justice she could go to prison for  years,"claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech",english,dcclothesline.com,http://i2.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Surveillance.jpg?fit=640%2C450,bs,comment hillary clinton charged obstruction justice could go prison years kingdom ambassador,going wikileaks tweet wikileaks director founder centre investigative journalism gavin macfadyen died age cause death yet unknown fellows arms flocked online post farewells including wikileaks cofounder julian assange extremely sad announce death gavin macfadyen cijs founder director leading light centre investigative journalism team wrote twitter extremely sad announce death gavin macfadyen cijs founder director leading light http tcijorggavinmacfadyen cij cijournalism pm oct macfadyen pioneering investigative journalist filmmaker back founded centre investigative journalism cij organization helped break several major stories trained number prominent journalists gavin macfadyen mentor assange closest friend london wikileaks sarah harrison joseph farrell many others wikileaks wikileaks oct mentor friend famous whistleblower cofounder wikileaks julian assange well director publication paying tribute head wikileaks published post groups twitter account saying macfadyen takes fists fight battle god gavin macfadyen beloved director wikileaks takes fists fight battle god sock forever gavin ja pictwittercomzyzsqxxk wikileaks wikileaks oct post signed ja indicating phrase belongs directly julian assange wikileaks claiming despite whistleblower deprived internet access suite ecuadorian embassy week able contact still full command cij team also published address macfadyens wife member julian assanges defense fund susan benn described husband largerthanlife person gratitude respect model journalist spearheaded creation journalistic landscape irrevocably lifted bar ethical hardhitting reporting gavin worked tirelessly hold power account life lived completely sync principles held dear practiced journalist educator comfort afflicted afflict comfortable benn wrote recounting husbands achievements said produced directed investigative documentaries covering diverse multiple countries problems also noted banned apartheid south africa soviet union investigative work also attacked british neonazis professional career macfadyen shed light topics like child labor pollution torture political prisoners neonazis britain uk industrial accidents contra murders nicaragua cia maritime piracy election fraud south america south african mines well many others worked investigative television programs pbss frontline granada televisions world action bbcs fine cut panorama money programme hours well channel dispatches cause macfadyens death yet made public original post wife susan wrote died short illness line removed know gavin macfadyen arrested bernie sanders body double nick nolte banned south africa ussr wikileaks wikileaks twitter full tributes colleagues likeminded people even hacktivist organization anonymous spoken deepest condolences gavin macfadyen well never forget investigative journalism https twittercomwikileaksstat us anonymous youranonnews rip gavin macfadyen larger life truly one kind https twittercomgijnstatus sheila coronel sheilacoronel gavin macfadyen purest bravest human ive ever met countless people love sending u love thanks pictwittercomyppsnjrwr matt kennard kennardmatt send loving thoughts gavin macfadyen family difficult time pictwittercomhzkiilujaa whistler whistler_news gavin macfadyen always kind supportive young journalists filmmakers never forget booming laugh thank friend kevin pina acrossmediums,1,,,,,
Nathaniel Mauka,2016-10-31T13:39:19.299+02:00,distracted by election  noone resisted the deep states patriot act,"michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

on friday the fbi announced an investigation into newly leaked emails linked to hillary clinton in a surprising twist the new leaked emails from the private email server were discovered after the fbi confiscated electronic devices belonging to top aide huma abedin her controversial and perverted husband anthony weiner 
officially the federal law enforcement agents are opening an investigation into weiner texting a yearold in north carolina and according to director comey the fbi were taking steps to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
shortly after the announcement donald trump utilized the situation to advantage and running theme of clintons corruption at a rally in new hampshire supporters nearly cheered in complete unison lock her up 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office said trump to the roaring crowd 
i have great respect for the fact that the fbi and the doj are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made mr trump said referring also to the department of justice this was a grave miscarriage of justice that the american people fully understand it is everybodys hope that it is about to be corrected 
the fbis decision to reopen their criminal investigation into hillary clintons secret email server just  days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be reince priebus the republican committee chairman said in a statement this stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why and whether they show intent to violate the law

earlier this week i wrote an oped about why i do not like early voting you can read the oped by clicking here  the oped offers explanations about why some states offer early voting and i express reasons how it can negatively effect an election 
of all my opinions given the one that stands out most today is this one anything can happen in a presidential election by voting early early voters cut themselves short in the event something negative happens to the candidate they voted for 
with just ten days left until nov  it was revealed yesterday that hillary clinton is once again under fbi investigation for her private email server thus the question becomes can citizens who voted early change their votes here is a video that provides the answer

taking states that the media has tried to downplay as if trump has no chance to win them dml shows how trump not only has a chance but predicts he will win these states and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts 
dml also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading he said trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades  some who have never voted  but now they are embracing trump these people are not being included in the polls 
early voting is also not a true representation of whats about to happen because more democrats tend to show up for early voting while the majority of republicans wait until election day 
watch this eyeopening video for a critical statebystate analysis that proves trump can easily win the election  then share it everywhere

illegal aliens are flooding through the border at an unprecedented pace according to border patrol agents the surge is taking place because human smugglers are issuing warning that its now or never to get into the us 
if trump wins the illegal aliens are told there will be a giant wall keeping them out of the us permanently if clinton wins they are led to believe amnesty will be granted both incentives are driving the illegal entries to a level not seen in years and according to agents in texas the border patrol is overwhelmed with  apprehensions per night in just one sector 
according to the department of homeland security in fiscal  the border patrol apprehended  immigrants from central america almost onethird of all apprehensions borderwide  and  more than during the socalled surge of  the agency also apprehended  haitians up from just  last year the number of immigrants claiming to be from africa and asia also is up

in the summer of  before the current presidential race ignited and two weeks before trump announced his candidacy dml gave a compelling speech during his tour in the state of massachusetts in front of an audience at a small town synagogue the awardwinning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others putting americans first 
dml emphasizes during his americans first speech that the number one issue in america is immigration he explains in crystal clear detail how immigration both legal and illegal goes beyond party identification he says its not a democrat or republican issue  its an american issue 
having traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself dml got a real sense for what concerned americans most therefore he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of  would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the american people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants 
remember its not an antiimmigration its an antiillegal immigration and its about being proamerica 
while putting americans first would have been dmls campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land this strategy was instead adopted by none other than donald jtrump this is one major reason why dml has supported trump since day one 
trump has done more than proven dml correct trump has proven how powerful the  americans first ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like barack obama and hillary clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the american people who are left to rot on the back burner 
watch an excerpt from the speech and then check out dmls electoral map and how he sees trump winning on tuesday

hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary clinton stood before millions of americans last night and told numerous lies then said things like google it suggesting we fact check herso we did and found  major lies plus others fact check   hillary clinton claimed that planned parenthood provides cancer screenings and therefore should not be defunded in spite of controversy about abortion factcheck mostly false this is a repeated claim deployed in defense of planned parenthood but it is not true at least as regards breast cancer as the leftleaning washington post s factchecker wrote in  when democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that planned parenthood provides mammograms this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the xrays the group does not provide mammograms rather the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies xrays or other specialized services it is slightly more accurate to say that women have access to mammograms via planned parenthood though its still slippery language fact check   hillary clinton responded to a question about supreme court and gun rights by saying i support the second amendment factcheck false when clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the district of columbia v heller  decision a decision dealing with the foundations of the second amendment the very roots of what it protects in the heller ruling scotus reaffirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms this decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia politics and journalism trying to persuade americans that the second amendment protects a collective right if collective the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or todays military or police forces so heller is crucial in fact it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire second amendment rests on it yet hillary disagrees the heller ruling her spokesman josh schwerin said hillary believes heller was  wrongly decided  so how can a woman who does not believe in an individual right to keep and bear arms support the second amendment she cant incidentally clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the heller decision was the way the scotus applied the second amendment in that case for those of you who may not know heller centered on washington dcs gun banwhich was subsequently struck down via the scotus decision to oppose the application of the second amendment in heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned that is not supporting the second amendment fact check   hillary clinton said during the third presidential debate in las vegas on wednesday that she will not add a penny to the debt if elected president factcheck false indeed hillary clintons claim is not even close to true the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts that under clintons policies  the debt would increase by  trillion over a decade clintons plan would increase both spending and revenue the washington dcbased independent nonprofits analyst said  under our preliminary updated central estimate she would increase primary spending by  trillion over the next decade including about  billion of spending on college education  billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure and significant new healthrelated spending fact check   hillary clinton claimed that  people a yeardie from guns factcheck false this is a claim clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the american people safe however a factcheck shows clintons claim is not only false but is exaggerated by  percent she is using figures from  and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year clinton first began making this claim in november  repeated it in april  and has since repeated it again and again in april breitbart news highlighted the method clinton used to swell the numbers in  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported  firearmrelated homicides in the united states an additional  accidental firearmrelated deaths occurred in the usa figure that pales in comparison to the  deaths by accidental poisoning or the  deaths caused by falls so clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides in this way  firearmrelated deathshomicides and accidental deathsquickly become  gun violence deaths in  and an impetus for gun control fact check   hillary clinton praised president obama s economic performance adding he has cut the deficit by twothirds factcheck false this repeated democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through obama s first year in office after the  billion stimulus the massive omnibus spending bill porkulus and the deployment of the troubled asset relief program tarp which was signed by obama s predecessor but for which he voted as breitbart news noted when president obama claimed in january to have cut the deficit by almost threequarters this is pure fiction obama has doubled the national debt and its not because he cut the deficit rather he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in officewhich he assigns dishonestly to the previous fiscal year under george w bush he cut ie spent more gradually from that spending but only under protest after republicans took the house in  the truth is that obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and illconceived experiment in keynesian stimulus spending much of which was wasted on priorities that helped obama s political supporters  especially the public sector unions  but did little for the economy fact check   hillary clinton said we at the clinton foundation spend ninety percent  ninety percent  of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country factcheck false indeed clintons ninety percent claim is false according to her troubled charitys own t ax filings  peter schweizer president of the government accountability institute  breitbart news senior editoratlarge and author of clinton cash said the clinton foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors if you actually look at the numbers of their filings and s thats what it indicates schweizer said last month in an interview with siriusxm host alex marlow on breitbart news daily  the clinton foundation will say we assisted or facilitated in  kids getting immunizations well okay what does that mean and they dont really tell you they dont really explain to you how it works so the number is absolutely correct that six percent goes to other charities schweizer continued the other  percent is in this stew of marketing and management and travel expenses and sort of all these obscure things that its really hard to dissect what is the end result of that  percent being spent whats more political analyst sean davis the cofounder of the federalist and a former adviser to sen tom coburn and gov rick perry examined the clinton foundations  tax filings and found that  hillary clintons nonprofit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants the clinton foundation spent nearly  million percent of all  expenditureson travel davis contends  nearly  million

as new revelations continue to unfold regarding hillary s time as secretary of state it has become clear that her state department was highly influenced by donors to the clinton foundation before hillary became secretary of state she had to sign an agreement with the obama administration restricting the ability of the clinton foundation to accept foreign donations in february of this year the clinton foundation admitted that the agreement had in fact been broken 
now it has been discovered that over half of nongovernment officials who met with hillary while she was secretary of state gave money to the clinton foundation what they received in return is just one of the questions hillary has refused to answer byavoiding the press for the past eight months in newly released emails there are details of donors being granted access to ambassadors due to their interest in the region the foundation putting pressure on hillary s staff to hire a former employee and the clinton global initiative leader demanding a top foundation donor be connected with the state department 
this is beyond the appearance of a conflict and americans have seen through the facade a majority of voters say they believe clinton gave special treatment to foundation donors while she was secretary of state as the president of judicial watch accurately pointed out there was no daylight between the two under mrs clinton and this was contrary to her promises 
after ignoring previous ethics guidelines the clintons are now trying to reassure americans by saying the foundation will change if hillary is elected the last ditch effort to gloss over ethics violations and possibly cover up corruption within hillary s state department is much too little and far too late americans are tired of being lied to by the clintons since the american people have a right to a full view of hillary s record before they head to the polls the clinton foundation should immediately release all of hillary s state department emails",english,dennismichaellynch.com,http://dennismichaellynch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-25-at-3.38.11-PM.jpg,bs,hillary insisted america fact check didheres huge lies debate,home news breaking illegal alien causes million damage deported timestrump pissed breaking illegal alien causes million damage deported timestrump pissed fisher hours ago news usa world comments breaking illegal alien causes million damage deported timestrump pissed breaking illegal alien causes million damage deported times trump pissed angel gilberto garciaavalos illegal alien living america reported five times recently caused million damage setting fire national forest california reason donald trump win november th people fedup illegal criminals washington times angel gilberto garciaavalos deported five times past four years yet time managed sneak mexico back us ended mischief driving without license attempted burglary felony weapons charges august graduated fullfledged mayhem sparking fire sequoia national forest already cost government million left countrys beautiful landscape scarred years come garcia pleaded guilty last month faces months prison recently released kern county jail likely would deported local authorities unable report immigration authorities californias new sanctuary city law prohibited sheriff communicating federal agents thanks lot sanctuary cities trump wins cities protect illegals feds receive funding liberal policies harm us proof whos going wind paying mess,1,,,,,

numbers have been doubling every decade since  african immigrants living in the us grew from  in  to  million as of  according to a study from the pew research center this group of voters say they are supporting trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents as the new flag bearer for conservative traditional politics a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the american dream and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of barack obama  despite trump s antiimmigrant rhetoric some african immigrants have been dissatisfied with obama s middling africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for america their own fortunes leading this pack is none other than president obama s kenyan halfbrother malik the yearold naturalized us citizen has spoken about his own brothers leadership as deep disappointment and said that trump was providing something new and something fresh to the american people some of the african trump supporters like malik have also voiced their

in the same email reines cryptically wrote about clintons email scandal that email retention  benghazi 
the march   correspondence was posted by wikileaks after the email was ostensibly captured in john podestas hacked gmail account 
the message was a response to a suggestion from clintons communications director jennifer palmieri that clinton make a joke about the email fiasco during a charity dinner later that day this was two months before the state department publicly released the first batch of clintons emails messages which had previously been provided to the house select committee on benghazi  
greetings i wanted to float idea of hrc making a joke about the email situation at the emilys list dinner tonight what do folks think about that palmieri asked in an email to numerous clinton confidantes including podesta and reines 
margolis and i discussed replied mandy grunwald a communications adviser to clinton we dont know whats in the emails so we are nervous about this might get a big laugh tonight and regret it when content of emails is disclosed 
thats when reines chimed in with his remarks 
trust me most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with read in total by america she would either win  states or lose  states i go back and forth 
im not hard over either way but i would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke because email retention  benghazi 
but if we could get some business done in a light way its worth trying signaling that she is more than fine with them making their way into the public domain because past the process stuff next phase is content and the assumption is that she did this secretly hiding etc simply not true we cant jam state to release them at this point but if dan can think of a light way to say i am proud of the work we did at state and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read whats in them as a way to better understand that work but until then i want to talk about doesnt need to be at the top could be at some natural point

these days it has most certainly become chic for the modern liberal to throw about accusations of racism although this type of racebaiting has been going on for a number of years now it became more noticeable during the  us presidential election when these liberals accuse donald trump of being racist they had better be careful for one specific reason 
a leaked video from  shows that during president obama s first campaign he was also concerned about border security and he even suggested a wall now there is just one dominant question anti trump individuals need to digest 
is obama a racist too because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse trump of lets play a quick game if you didnt know who said this would you think it was donald trump in  or barack obama in  
this mans core goal was to preserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration does this sound like trump or obama  
how about this one this man said additional fencing could help get our border under control definitely sounds more like a gop candidate than a democrat one thats for sure 
finally this man also supported additional personnel infrastructure and technology on our border and at ports of entry liberals would love to claim these quotes came from donald j trump  especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment 
i hate to steal their thunder but these quotes did indeed come from a young barack obama in  even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him 
so it is one thing when leaked videos show hillary clinton believed border security was important it was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important but when liberal idol barack obama says it say it isnt so liberals just cant handle that 
but anyway folks it is all about platforms im sure you have learned by now that donald trump doesnt get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy first of all he is a conservative so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate 
republicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control luckily people saw through the propaganda and decided that obama s brand was simply not working any longer

november oettinger ich habe nichts gegen schlitzaugen einige meiner besten freunde sind reisfresser wieder einmal hat günther oettinger cdu mit einer rede für aufsehen gesorgt dabei fiel im hinblick auf china unter anderem die formulierung schlitzaugen und schlitzohren im exklusiven postillon interview äußert sich der künftige euhaushaltskommissar nun detailliert zu seinen umstrittenen äußerungen postillon herr oettinger derzeit werden sie von vielen menschen kritisiert weil sie chinesen unter anderem als schlitzaugen bezeichnet haben viele haben das als rassistische äußerung aufgefasst oettinger das ist völlig falsch rübergekommen ich habe nichts gegen schlitzaugen einige meiner besten freunde sind reisfresser postillon ach ja wie heißen die denn diese besten freunde oettinger äh ich bin zum beispiel erst neulich sushiessen gewesen und habe dem kellner sogar ein trinkgeld gegeben der hieß wahrscheinlich tsching tschang tschong oder keine ahnung die schauen doch alle gleich aus außerdem habe ich mal thailand urlaub gemacht wo ich die kultur der gelbhäute aus erster hand erleben konnte postillon wie darf man ihre aussagen denn dann verstehen oettinger das war als kompliment gemeint ich habe nämlich unglaublichen respekt vor diesen chinamännern weil sie unglaublich fleißig sind und das obwohl sie nur ein beschränktes sichtfeld haben und dazu noch klein sind postillon haben sie eine botschaft das chinesische volk oettinger ja ich sags besten gleich dass sie es verstehen räuspert sich liebe asiamännel hiel splicht günthel oettingel ich möchte mich auflichtig bei ihnen entschuldigen sollte jemand von ihnen velweichlicht sein dass ich ihn mit meinen wolten velletzt haben könnte tut mil das leid bitte investielen sie tlotzdem fleißig ländel del eu und lassen sie sich ihlen hund schmecken postillon klare worte oettinger ja ich schätze nach diesel äh dieser entschuldigung sollte dann auch das ganze missverständnis ausgeräumt sein postillon meinten sie genau als sie ihrer rede von einer pflichthomoehe sprachen oettinger herrgott sind die tucken jetzt auch noch beleidigt dann entschuldige ich mich dafür eben auch noch sorry liebe hinterlader war echt nicht gemeint also bitte beruhigen sie sich gehen sie shoppen schwuchteln sie herum auch immer man halt macht als sodomist postillon damit dürften sie wieder rehabilitiert sein kommen wir zu ihren beruflichen aussichten nach zwei jahren als eukommissar für digitalwirtschaft wechseln sie jetzt auf den posten des haushaltskommissars oettinger das kam tatsächlich überraschend immerhin habe ich mich gerade langsam den job als digitalkommissar reingefuchst ich habe sogar schon mit dem gedanken gespielt mir dieses internet selbst mal anzuschauen quasi im saiberschbäis zu sörfen wie profis das nennen das kann ich mir jetzt wohl sparen postillon wie haben sie reagiert als sie erfuhren dass sie haushaltskommissar werden sollen oettinger erst war ich stinksauer haushalt ist ja eigentlich frauensache ich habe nicht verstanden warum die da einen mann haben wollen aber dann hat mir wer erklärt dass haushalt mit geld zu tun hat klar dass man das keine frau machen lassen kann postillon haben sie schon erste politische pläne oettinger nein ich hatte noch keine zeit mich mit den für meinen neuen aufgabenbereich zuständigen wirtschaftslobbyisten zu treffen ich kann ich ihnen erst

jahrzehnten deckel von gläsern zu fest zuschraubt eisenach archiv  eines der größten kriminalistischen rätsel der nachkriegszeit ist nach jahrzehntelangen ermittlungen offenbar gelöst beamte des bundeskriminalamts haben heute in eisenach einen jährigen mann festgenommen der im verdacht steht im ganzen bundesgebiet seit  millionenfach deckel von mit lebensmitteln gefüllten gläsern so fest zugeschraubt zu haben dass sie von nichtsahnenden käufern kaum noch geöffnet werden konnten das vorgehen des mutmaßlichen täters oskar g den die boulevardpresse das deckelphantom nennt war dabei stets gleich im schutz der dunkelheit schlich er sich in lagerhallen fabriken und supermärkte wo er bis in die morgenstunden die deckel möglichst vieler gläser fest zudrehte  gläser die normalerweise von jedem menschen leicht hätten geöffnet werden können in seiner hochphase kam er so regelmäßig auf mehr als  deckel in einer nacht sie haben ihn so spektakulär wie oskar gs verbrechen  zeitweise war fast jedes fünfte in deutschland verkaufte glas von ihm manipuliert  war auch seine festnahme vierzehn polizeibeamte waren nötig um ihn in handschellen zu legen es ist unglaublich wieviel kraft er in seinen dünnen armen hat so bkasprecher jochen schäfer er kann zupacken wie eine schraubzwinge und hat mehreren beamten die schulter ausgekugelt als heiße spur zum mutmaßlichen täter hatte sich ein einzelner fingerabdruck erwiesen der bereits  an einem marmeladeglas in einer supermarktfiliale im ostfriesischen wittmund gefunden worden war offenbar hatte oskar g den deckel so fest zugeschraubt dass dabei sein handschuh unbemerkt geplatzt war  ein fataler fehler ohne diesen glücksfund hätten wir diesem monster wohl nie das handwerk legen können so schäfer doch was geht in dem kopf des mannes

einhornfleisch wohl kaum für euro pro tafel angeboten werden kann und tatsächlich laboranalysen ergaben dass der vermeintlichen einhornschokolade noch nicht einmal spuren von einhorn enthalten sind stattdessen besteht das produkt aus milchschokolade und mit lebensmittelfarbe bunt eingefärbtem pegasusfleisch bis auf kopf schweif und hufe werden fast alle teile eines pegasusses verarbeitet udo wörne wundert das wenig weil einhorn mit preisen von bis zu euro pro kilogramm kaum bezahlbar ist greifen viele hersteller auf wesentlich günstigeres pegasusfleisch zurück die geflügelten pferde werden meist ähnlich wie schweine oder geflügel massenhaft großen hallen gehalten wobei ihnen regelmäßigen abständen die schwungfedern gestutzt werden um fluchtversuche zu unterbinden einhörner dagegen gelten als äußerst empfindlich und verenden gefangenschaft der regel innerhalb weniger wochen jämmerlich produkten die tatsächlich echtes einhorn enthalten sind daher fast immer wilde einhörner verarbeitet diese werden mit netzen gefangen und dann mit einem sogenannten einhornhaken aus metall ausgeweidet geschmacklich unterscheiden sich pegasus und einhorn gravierend einhornfleisch

erlebnisgutschein einlösen münchen dpo  helle aufregung in der firmenzentrale der jochen schweizer gmbh dort hat heute erstmals in der firmengeschichte ein kunde versucht einen geschenkgutschein tatsächlich einzulösen noch sind die anwesenden mitarbeiter ratlos wie sie mit der kuriosen anfrage umgehen sollen mehrere stehen unter schock was sollen wir nur tun was machen wir denn jetzt fragt kundenmanagerin erika schwenninger  verzweifelt hat schon jemand den chef erreichen können sie wirkt sichtlich angeschlagen von der bizarren situation in der sie sich als angestellte bei jochen schweizer noch nie befunden hat seit über  jahren vertreibt das unternehmen hauptsächlich über das internet geschenkgutscheine für events und erlebnisse die gutscheine sind ein beliebtes präsent zu geburtstagen oder anderen gelegenheiten und kommen insbesondere dann zum einsatz wenn die schenkenden keine ideen für ein richtiges geschenk haben die erlebnisse sind dabei so abschreckend gewählt tandembungee dampflok selber fahren bei lutherstadt eisleben dass normalerweise niemand ernsthaft erwägt die gutscheine einzulösen er stürzt mit seiner gier ein unternehmen in die kriese thorsten koschwitz auch im fall von thorsten koschwitz sei daher nicht mit komplikationen zu rechnen gewesen der hannoveraner hatte den gutschein für autocrashen mit dem monstertruck im wert von  euro im september zu seinem  geburtstag bekommen dass er nun darauf besteht tatsächlich mit einem riesigen truck autos zerstören zu dürfen stellt die firma vor schier unlösbare probleme was glaubt der mann denn wo wir nun so einen truck hernehmen sollen ganz zu schweigen von den zu zerstörenden autos führt erika schwenninger aus und das ganze für maximal  euro und was ist wenn noch mehr menschen auf die idee kommen ihre gutscheine einzulösen dann können wir den laden dicht machen schwenninger bricht in tränen aus die sorge um den verlust ihres arbeitsplatzes ist groß das kann doch niemand ernsthaft wollen denn jochen schweizer lebt  ebenso wie andere ähnliche gutscheinportale  davon ein gefühl zu verschenken nervenkitzel auf papier die beschenkten soll beim blick auf den titel des geschenks gänsehaut überkommen der darauf eingetragene eurobetrag soll zeigen wie viel der beschenkte seinen freunden wert ist die einnahmen durch die gutscheinverkäufe refinanzieren das personal des unternehmens den firmensitz die aufwändige internetpräsenz und die teure werbung für die umsetzung echter events ist in der kalkulation kein platz darum hat nun jochen schweizer persönlich thorsten koschwitz ein gespräch angeboten der firmengründer will den jungen mann um verständnis bitten und zu einem kostengünstigeren erlebnis wie igelcrashen mit dem golf ii oder nüssecrashen mit dem nussknacker überreden um weitere missverständnisse wie im falle von thorsten koschwitz auszuschließen sollen jochenschweizergutscheine zudem künftig immer folgende fußnote beinhalten gutschein ist nur

oppositionspolitiker gemeinsamer gefängniszelle,dienstag november ratgeber alles sie jetzt über die uswahl wissen müssen für die usa ist es ein schicksalstag heute entscheidet sich ob donald trump oder hillary clinton das weiße haus einziehen wird doch wie genau funktioniert eigentlich die präsidentschaftswahl den usa hier erfahren sie alles sie jetzt wissen müssen warum wird den usa einem dienstag gewählt die amerikaner wählen nicht dienstags sondern wie die meisten anderen länder auch sonntag durch die zeitverschiebung von rund zwei tagen zwischen den usa general motor time und deutschland mittelhochdeutsche winterzeit ist es nur für uns dienstag wann genau erfahre ich hier deutschland wer die uswahl gewonnen hat voraussichtlich im herbst spätestens dann sollte der auf die wahl folgende bürgerkrieg ausgefochten und einer der beiden kandidaten siegreich aus dem gemetzel hervorgegangen sein ich habe keine wahlbenachrichtigung erhalten ist nun zu tun laut ihrer ipadresse und ihren facebookposts leben sie nicht den usa die uswahlen sind wie der name schon sagt usbürgern vorbehalten ach wer darf denn dann wählen wählen darf den usa jeder mensch der folgende voraussetzungen erfüllt über jahre alt hat jeder drei jahre zeit um das wahlsystem kennenzulernen bevor er seine frustration ab seinem geburtstag mit alkohol betäuben darf usbürger bürger der usa wird man entweder durch geburt oder durch ritterschlag der königin von amerika patriot wer kein patriot ist darf nicht wählen um als patriot anerkannt zu werden muss man mindestens einmal nachweislich sex mit der usamerikanischen flagge gehabt haben jemand anderes als sie wer sie ist darf nicht wählen also vergessen sies einfach achtung jeder usbürger hat nur eine stimme das heißt dass bürger die schon bei einer der letzten präsidentschaftswahlen abgestimmt haben automatisch disqualifiziert sind wird der uspräsident direkt gewählt nein der uspräsident wird nicht direkt vom volk gewählt das volk wählt lediglich sogenannte wahlmänner die wiederum innerhalb von tagen einen ihrer freunde damit beauftragen müssen einen geeigneten nachbarn auszusuchen dessen tante väterlicherseits dann auf dem großen tantenkonvent washington dc gemeinsam mit den anderen entsandten tanten den präsidenten bestimmt nachteil für den wähler dadurch kann es passieren dass jemand präsident wird den man selbst gar nicht gewählt hat passiert bei gleichstand bei gleichstand der stimmen dürfen beide endkandidaten zusammen uspräsident sein der geschichte der usa kam das lediglich einmal vor trumancapote hilft gegen schluckauf es gibt diverse hausmittel soll es zum beispiel helfen dendie betroffenen zu erschre moment mal bitte nur fragen zur uswahl menno na gut welche bundesstaaten sind november entscheidend spannend wird es insbesondere den sogenannten swingstates sie heißen weil sie wie das pendel einer uhr unkontrolliert über dem gebiet der usa herumschwingen da die wähler denen es ohnehin von früh bis spät speiübel ist aufgrund der heftigen schwingbewegung ihres staates große schwierigkeiten haben ihr kreuz bei dem kandidaten zu machen den sie wählen wollen gelten sie als unkalkulierbar folgende staaten gelten als swingstates east virginia montezuma haribo ohiowa old baconshire guantanamo und new vada es war viel von möglichem wahlbetrug die rede ist das wahrscheinlich wahlbetrug im großen stil im sinne einer mehrfachen oder unberechtigten stimmabgabe ist nach meinung aller experten sehr unwahrscheinlich echte profis manipulieren die wahl indem buh ist der schluckauf weg äh weiter im text indem sie der bevölkerung etwa versprechen ihr land wieder großartig zu machen ohne näher darauf einzugehen wie das gelingen soll welche auswirkungen hat der ausgang der wahl auf deutschland egal wer die wahl gewinnt als deutscher dürfen sie sich grundsätzlich überlegen fühlen und die wähler den usa für ihre dummheit verachten ob der atomkrieg mit russland ende aus geostrategischen hardlinerpositionen entsteht clinton oder das ende einer twitterfehde mit wladimir putin ist trump spielt ohnehin keine große rolle ssi dan pfg fed,1,,,,,
