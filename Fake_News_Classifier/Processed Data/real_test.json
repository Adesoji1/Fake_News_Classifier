    "text": "zero hedge october   \nin the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the clinton campaign and the doj among the recent batch of hacked emails released by wikileaks we learn that the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta hillarys campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik  who is currently a top official at the us justice department serving as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs \npeter kadzik with lobbyist tony podesta brother of john podesta  \nthe postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant the dinner was set for  that evening just one day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee  \npodesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  another email sent on may    kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign \nas the daily caller notes  the dinner arrangement is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices as one former us attorney tells told the dc the exchanges are another example of the clinton campaigns cozy relationship with the obama justice department \nthe hacked emails confirm that podesta and kadzik were in frequent contact in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign a d v e r t i s e m e n t \nthe political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group \n its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton  he added comparing the podestakadzik meetings to the revelation that attorney general loretta lynch met in private with bill clinton at the airport in phoenix days before the fbi and doj investigating hillary clinton \nkadziks role at the doj where he started in  is particularly notable kadzik as helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president \na long friendly history \npodesta and kadzik have a long history one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal as dc helps summarize kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office \nthat history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who  kept me out of jail \nas the dc chuck ross notes it is unclear to which case podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison but podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the lewinsky affair and the rich pardon scandal as deputy chief of staff to clinton in  podesta asked thenunited nations ambassador bill richardson to hire the yearold lewinsky  in april  the white house transferred lewinsky from her job as a white house intern to the pentagon in order to keep her and bill clinton separate but the clinton team also wanted to keep lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with clinton \nrichardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered lewinsky the position but that she declined it \npodesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco \npodesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal \nkadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta \nthe report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon \non top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library \nkadziks current role \nin his current role as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton \nbut kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation  \nin a feb   letter in response to kadzik florida rep ron desantis noted that kadzik had explained that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the attorney general when an investigation or prosecution by the department of justice would create a potential conflict of interest \ndesantis a republican suggested that lynchs appointment by bill clinton in  as us attorney in new york may be considered a conflict of interest he also asserted that obamas political appointees  a list which includes kadzik  are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states  \nit is unknown if kadzik responded to desantis questions \nkadziks first involvement in the clinton email brouhaha came in a sept   response letter to senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the doj was investigating clinton last month politico reported that kadzik angered republican lawmakers when in a classified briefing he declined to say whether clinton aides who received doj immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes \nkadzik also testified at a house oversight committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the fbis files of the clinton email investigation this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",

    "text": "search the left in power  clinton to obama david horowitz explains how the democrats became a leftwing party in volume vii of the black book of the american left october   richard baehr \nbelow is richard baehrs review of david horowitzs new book the left in power clinton to obama reprinted from american thinker with permission the book is volume  of the black book of the american left  a multivolume collection of david horowitzs conservative writings that will when completed be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the left and its agenda order here  we encourage our readers to visit blackbookoftheamericanleftcom which features horowitzs introductions to volumes  of this volume series along with their tables of contents reviews and interviews with the author \nevery year there is some report of the blissful ignorance of american history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite american universities suffice it to say the collected writings of david horowitz on the american left which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of american politics are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list \nhorowitzs latest book the left in power clinton to obama  is the seventh volume in his ninevolume collection the black book of the american left  this new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century focusing primarily on the lefts control in our government and culture as horowitz reveals even during the bush years conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy bush and his chances for reelection in  their primary mode of attack was to undermine americas efforts in iraq almost from the start of the conflict when just months earlier a majority of senate democrats and near half of house democrats had supported the president the left then destroyed bushs second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of hurricane katrina there was plenty of incompetence in the response to katrina but local and state officials  all democrats of course and many of them african american  were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis \nthe immediate abandonment of support for the iraq war effort was a signal event in american history sending a message that a large part of the democratic party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas the weak effort by some democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve  end the war support the troops  was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces so too the obsession with abu ghraib gave the lie to the democrats support our troops message as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis \nhorowitz outlines this narrative faulting the bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into iraq and the risks if we had done nothing regrettably the bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the iraq war out to the media most in the media considered the bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the  presidential contest a lie to be sure  unfortunately it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the lefts agenda the soft liberalism of walter cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side during the current presidential election cycle we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year it is a special time they argue because trump is in their view a unique threat to the republic \non the other hand the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by barack obama  the loss of respect abroad for americas will to fight the degradation of our military readiness the fraying of ties with allies and the near obsessive outreach to americas enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with iran best described as an abject surrender of american interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime about  of those supposedly sensible proisrael democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal with no visible regrets to date there was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party the media were happy to parrot the administrations talking points for the nuclear deal something the manipulators crowed over at the white house \nat least in the propaganda use of abu ghraib the left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military as horowitz outlines in article after article the left is fighting a war that most americans do not see disguising its intentions through its aggressive unceasing promotion of progressive policies to make america a better place this commitment to deception emerges horowitz reveals from the allegiance to the ideology of saul alinskys rules for radicals a formative doctrine for both barack obama and hillary clinton the progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe in america the left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public but also horowitz argues it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing one prime example was the admission of mit professor and obamacare architect jonathan gruber that health care law would never have made it through congress if it had been presented honestly \nthe left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically horowitz provides chapter and verse on the lefts efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool  motor voter registration with no birth certificate required fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and turning the clock back even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register support for open borders expansion of legal immigration and amnesty and citizenship and voting rights for more than ten million already in the country illegally here the lefts mentor and financier is george soros and his buddies who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically and horowitz has done a great public service by his discover the network listing of the people responsible for americas steady drift to the radical left \nthe left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates of course the problems of americas inner cities all under complete control of one political party for half a century have never been of even near equal interest to the democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters particularly african americans the left has fully endorsed the teacher unions opposition to charter schools and voucher programs though both are popular with minority group parents and children the two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the democratic party campaign cash votes and volunteers for the left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce \nin the last two years the sorosfunded black lives matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year many of them in situations where the victims were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them  michael brown in ferguson is a prime example one wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks perhaps because there are no riots or looting these incidents have no cachet more likely they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current president to hillary clinton \nin chicago in  months this year over  blacks mostly men have been shot and killed almost exclusively by other black men by year end over  chicagoans will have been shot one might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in charlotte chicagos mayor says that police have gone fetal avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods with the aclu looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by chicagos mayor to protect his reelection bid rahm emanuel must also have read alinsky for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost the victims of the police pullback in chicago baltimore st louis and other cities called the ferguson effect are many more dead black men killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the s even the fbi director admits the ferguson effect is real when not covering for hillary clinton \nhorowitz latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the left and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century he provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the new york times and there is always a horrible slur available from the left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions the left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it it argues that these are people horowitz included unworthy of serious consideration or respect \nsilencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the left so far horowitz keeps writing and america is free enough that the left though it clearly wants to cannot ban his books george soros and his family have another  billion to spend on changing america the alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an america where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth so results are all equal and we can all sing along with the pete seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil and disinvest in defense every year \nlets hope that some of americas young will read horowitz booksand learn what their professors and teachers wont teach them",

    "text": "an eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute october   matthew vadum \nthe obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect democrats according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute \nduring eric holders term as attorney general from february  through april  a little under  billion was paid by us banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but  million of that sum came from three big settlements bank of america citigroup and jp morgan chase \nmany of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas regardless of the reasons for the disparity \ninstead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks the money flows to leftist allies of president obama \nadding insult to injury the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the money how the department of justice funds progressive activists bestselling clinton cash author and anticorruption crusader peter schweizer is gais president the full page report is available in pdf form here  \nthe report states \nthe department of justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority \nit adds these funds directed by the doj effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress \nmuch of the cash moves through neighborworks the nonprofit gave more than  million to the rabblerousing group neighborhood assistance corp of america naca whose leader bruce marks calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over  million to asian americans for equality aafe an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north korean sympathizer \nthe illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as national council of la raza nhs of chicago national urban league and operation hope \nmany of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats \ncatalist a george sorosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive the report states \ncatalist was founded by former bill clinton aide harold ickes in  following democrats electoral wipeout in  leftwing activists believed republicans owed george w bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology including databases \naccording to a capital research center report  \ncatalist boasts it was vital to president obamas  victory by its own admission over  organizations campaigns and committees used the companys services based on data that was loaded into the catalist databases and then standardized a catalist analysis of the  cycle says progressive organizations the obama campaign and federal party committees attempted to contact more than  million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over  of the us adult population contacts were delivered inperson over the phone by mail and over the internet \nof course leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like george soros and michael bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal state and local levels \nthe report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist \nin other words the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of america there is no level socalled playing field in american electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else \nconservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half century the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical subversive causes in the united states \nchanges in federal social policy in the mids helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing under the profoundly antisocial war on poverty the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since  to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say america declared war on itself and conscripted saul alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left  including groups like acorn and moneygrubbing con artists like jesse jackson sr  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests \nconservative groups receive no such largesse from uncle sam and in fairness many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it \nthis sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if hillary clinton becomes president secretary of labor tom perez  no stranger to the shakedown business himself is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new clinton administration perez who previously ran the dojs civil rights division is also a past president of casa de maryland a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by george soros and the late venezuelan strongman hugo chavez \nthe moneyraising scam described in the gai report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts \nactivist groups were encouraged to agitate by the carterera community reinvestment act which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone but banks that didnt got their legs broken \nfew serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of  were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination \nleftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was and is pure gangsterism through the magic of dysphemism the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending \nthe shaking down of lenders intensified when thentreasury secretary robert rubin presided over the clinton administrations effort to put the cra on steroids banks began to make risky subprime loans and fannie mae and freddie mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities these practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of acorn and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers fannie and freddie which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market \npresident clinton turned the community reinvestment act a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law into one of the most powerful mandates shaping american citiesand as senate banking committee chairman phil gramm memorably put it a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks howard husock of the manhattan institute wrote in city journal  \nwhen husock wrote in  us banks had committed nearly  trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups intent in some cases on teaching their lowincome clients that the financial system is their enemy and implicitly that government rather than their own striving is the key to their wellbeing \nenterprising leftwing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes \nand they never will",

    "text": "search what will replace isis this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam october   daniel greenfield \ndaniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam \nbefore long the same administration that declared the fighting in iraq over several times will claim victory over isis the timetable for its push against the islamic state appears to have less do with the victimized christians and yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of syrian muslims than with the clinton presidential campaign like obamas declarations that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were over the announcement that isis has been defeated will be premature \nit is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of islamic terrorism \nlong before its current string of defeats isis had begun evolving into another al qaeda a multinational alliance of jihadists scattered around the world bombing mosul isnt hard but try bombing marseille brussels or london there is no doubt that the ability of isis to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from new york to miami to nice to munich but it would be dangerous to assume that losing iraq and syria will stop isis \nisis doesnt matter the idea of isis does and the idea of isis is islamic supremacism \nthe organization we think of isis has transformed and rebranded countless times even now our leaders vacillate between calling it isis isil or more childishly daesh while it dubs itself the islamic state we have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade it would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities \nthe bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization we are fighting an idea that is not to contend as obama does that we can debate it to death it is not the sort of idea that argues with words but with bullets bombs and swords but neither does it just go away if you seize a city \nal qaeda in iraq not only survived the death of zarqawi but it became even more dangerous under baghdadi it would be risky to assume that isis will die with him instead it may very well grow into a new phase of al qaeda one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from al qaedas leadership fatigue \nthe rise of islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them if isis does recede into a localized oblivion reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in baghdad then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate \nto break the cycle we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of islamic terrorism \nisis is not unislamic it is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly islamic in that unlike its predecessors in the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities its goals are the same as those of every islamic political organization including those dubbed moderate it seeks to restore and enforce an islamic system in every part of the muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonmuslim world if this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists then it could be bombed to pieces in some syrian or iraqi backwater \nbut its the driving force of islam thats why it wont go away no amount of appeasement will banish it \ntaking in more muslim settlers pressuring israel and letting the muslim brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it weve tried it and it actually makes islamic terrorism much worse \nwhen the announcement is made the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated isis by mobilizing a muslim coalition but it wasnt obama who mobilized a muslim coalition the coalition such as it was mobilized them obama provided useful support to islamic state sponsors of terror such as iran and turkey assorted islamic jihadists on the ground some blatantly associated with sunni and shiite terror groups in their internal jihadist conflict with isis over who will fight us \nthe allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow \nand that is why claiming credit for beating isis accomplishes nothing isis is an expression of an islamic impulse encoded in the koran islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse isis was nastier and uglier than most of the islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this though even it found its boko haram affiliate in nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach \nif isis vanishes from the world stage islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss or so the thinking goes the islamic state was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash islamic terror it was hard to ignore but a scattering of islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public \nhistory suggests thats wishful thinking \nislamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding growing muslim populations both at home and in muslim settlements in the west and the increase in travel and communications the infrastructure of globalism spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world wealthy and unstable muslim countries rich in oil but poor in power finance its spread through mosques and guns \nthese are the ingredients that give us isis or any other combination or letters that stands for islamic terror to do anything meaningful about it we would have to reverse the decline of the west \nislam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline civilizational decline is why it is rising once again an obscure local terror group eventually turned into isis by filling a power vacuum even as obama performs another touchdown dance some other group will be making that same journey its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own \nuntil we come to terms with this civilizational struggle we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy we are not fighting an acronym whether its isis or isil we are fighting an islamic state \nthis is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam",

    "text": "the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists equating counterjihadists with jihadists robert spencer \nthe objective of this libelous new report from the hardleft moneymaking and incitement machine the southern poverty law center splc is made plain within it before you book a spokesperson from an antimuslim extremist group or quote them in a story research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to  of the most visible antimuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform \nthey wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat blaming us for a supposed rise in islamophobia if they really want to stamp out suspicion of islam of course they will move against not us but the likes of omar mateen syed rizwan farook tashfeen malik nidal malik hasan mohammed abdulazeez dzhokhar tsarnaev and the myriad other muslims who commit violence in the name of islam and justify it by reference to islamic teachings \nthe splc doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop islamophobia at all but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of islamophobes who can only be stopped if you write a check to the splc thats what this is really all about \nin constructing this illusory edifice the splc labels me and fourteen others antimuslim extremists we are of course no more antimuslim than foes of the nazis were antigerman but note the word extremists thats the mainstream media and obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists in what way are we extremists has anyone on the splcs hit list and given the splcs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up beheaded anyone boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people no all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and sharia oppression the splc is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonmuslim bin ladens and awlakis until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the splcs libel is only that a libel \nits also passingly ironic that the splc list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as islamophobes but their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the index of prohibited thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings \nthe report as a whole stands as an example of the lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why apparently the splc knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts \nthe splcs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false for example it says that ann corcoran of refugee resettlement watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps this is a case that corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the splc doesnt bother to try disproving it says that steven emerson of the investigative project on terrorism has claimed that the obama administration extensively collaborates with the muslim brotherhood that he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them as andrew c mccarthy has noted  barack obama has spent his presidency cultivating islamists particularly from the international muslim brotherhood and its affiliates in the united states the splc also hits emerison for having asserted that europe is riddled with nogo zones regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks \ngermany police sick of citizens nogo zone fears \nthe splc excoriates brigitte gabriel of act for america for saying that any practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah  who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day  this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the united states yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the quran that contradict american constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more how to reconcile these teachings with us citizenship the splc did not bother to explain \nthe splc quotes david horowitz saying there are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the democratic party even those who are antiterrorist here again no refutation is offered  yet the lefts dalliance with palestinian jihad groups and overall antiamericanism make it impossible to dismiss horowitzs assertion \nfrank gaffney of the center for security policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about muslims destroying the west from within the splc doesnt bother to mention the explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the brotherhood in north america  the captured muslim brotherhood internal document that explained that brotherhood members must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions \nin attacking pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative the splc descended to outright fabrications notes geller  their claim that i insist that obama is the love child of malcolm x is patently untrue the splc also states that i have spoken to a neofascist group in germany when in fact i have never even been to germany it characterizes former fbi agent john guandolos claim that cia director john brennan was a convert to islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a us asset assigned overseas with brennan in saudi arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that brennan was indeed the target of a saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion brennan has also stated publicly that he visited mecca which is impossible for a nonmuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the saudi king \neven more strangely the splc targets ayaan hirsi ali a woman who grew up as a muslim in somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of muslims is under death threats from muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of muslims instead of trying to discredit her the splc should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against sharia oppression but the splc has other priorities \nof me the splc concedes that i am a real intellectual but complains that i am entirely selftaught in the study of islam an odd objection one cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual in any case its false i am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct nonetheless the fact is that i did first read the quran and began studying islam in earnest while at the university of north carolina my claims says the splc are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them \nit even says that i have referred to barack obama as the first muslim president this one epitomizes the dishonesty of the splc the quote comes from an article i wrote in  discussing how obama was not a muslim stating that his obvious affinity for islam and the muslim world could make him into our first muslim president the way bill clinton was called our first black president after eight years of obama id say i was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion \nthe splc finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict muslims in a positive light \nthe facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the splc george soros funded a report on islamophobia on twitter and gave  to the center for american progress for a defamatory report on alleged islamophobes he also spent  for favorable coverage of the muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the iran deal  and bought islamophobia propaganda after the san bernardino jihad massacre \nbut what need does the splc have of facts it knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the splc is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant left those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the splc feels bound to respect",

    "text": "the psychopathic and insincere jihad islams natural appeal to criminals psychopaths and murderers october   \nraymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center \nwhenever muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow muslims islams apologists loudly proclaim aha see theyre not true muslims or in the words of cia head john brennan on the islamic state they are terrorists theyre criminals mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct \noverlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs murderers some may not even believe in allah at all yet this does not exonerate islam for its religious construct was designed to entice such men \nas usual  this traces back to the prophet muhammad after telling his followers that allah had permitted muslims four wives and limitless concubines koran  he later claimed that allah had delivered a new revelation koran  permitting him muhammad alone to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted in response his young wife aisha quipped i feel that your lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires apostates from islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet \nbut it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites for whoever fights in the name of allah andor seeks to empower islamthat is jihadisterroristsis exonerated of all blame and if he dies fighting guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits \nthats because allah made a pact with them according to koran  allah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them paradise they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain rejoice then in the bargain you have struck for that is the supreme triumph muhammad elaborated lining up for battle in the path of allah jihad to empower islam is worthier than  years of worship moreover the martyr is special to allah he is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds he sees his throne in paradise he will wed the aynhour supernatural celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains and he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour \nas for those muslims who reject jihad muhammad said they will be tortured like no other sinful human for many more islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise see here  \nthere is no denying that the historic growth of islam is related to its carnal incentives after more than a decade of preaching in mecca muhammad had about  followers mostly relatives it was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied so long as such fighters helped spread the banner of islam into infidel lands they were deemed good and pious muslimsregardless of their true intentions priorities or even faith \nmany of the original jihadis now revered in islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics consider khalid bin alwalid a meccan pagan he opposed muhammad for years but when the prophet seized mecca khalidlike many of muhammads foes such as his archenemy abu sufyanexpediently converted proclaimed the shahada  joined the winning team and then went ajihadingmutilating plundering raping enslaving crucifying and setting people on fire in the process but because he did so under the banner of jihad this serial killer and rapist is today one of islams most revered heroes \nthe reason for this is that nowhere in islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart or if hes right with god allah is not god he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords so long as his fighters proclaim the shahada there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messengerand fight under the banner of islam they can take plunder murder and rape the infidels and if they die doing so they go to paradise \nsuch was the genius of muhammad in the arabian society he lived in members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all muslims regardless of raceand the infidels who deserve to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity for rejecting allah \nthis explains why other tribalnomadic societiesturks and mongolstatars whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to islam and under the banner of jihad continued preying on the other the infidel but now as venerated champions of the faith \nchristian europe was aware of islams true appeal from the very beginning theophanes the byzantine scholar d  wrote the following about muhammad in his chronicles he taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see koran  and he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating drinking and women also there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring eg koran     and all sorts of other nonsense \ncenturies later st thomas aquinas d  made similar observations he muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us his teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure in all this as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men as for proofs of the truth of his doctrine muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants what is more no wise men men trained in things divine and human believed in him from the beginning those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers utterly ignorant of all divine teaching through whose numbers mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms \nthere is finally another group of muslims who should not be overlooked these do not give a fig for allah nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise but they rely on islam to justify robbing enslaving raping and killing nonmuslims as many christian minorities in nations like pakistan and egypt will attest because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonmuslim against a muslim that is a nontribal member against a tribal membermuslim criminals target nonmuslim minorities precisely because they know muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels \nin short enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is in the words of the cias brennan terrorists criminals psychopathic thugs and murderers yes they are but that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife but knows that as long as they only victimize infidels no muslim will hold them accountable in both cases islam aids and abets their behavior",

    "text": "the muslim bloc may have won the battle but did israel win the war october   ari lieberman \nby now it should be clear to all but the blindest or rabidly disingenuous that the united nations is an organization that has been coopted by the nefarious interests of muslim nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as todays greatest purveyor of judeophobia historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco that deny the indisputable jewish nexus to the holy city \non april  the member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly onesided resolution that referred to jewish holy sites in jerusalem exclusively by their muslim names and designated the temple mount judaisms holiest site as a muslim holy site of worship to add insult to injury the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that israel was planting jewish fake graves in other spaces of the muslim cemeteries \nunsurprisingly the resolution which was submitted by seven muslim nations passed by a wide margin with  votes in favor six against and  abstentions two nations were absent for the vote france sweden slovenia and spain shamefully supported the vile resolution \nthat the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of unesco but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner european support and israel could thus claim a moral victory france with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble \nbut following the vote a crack appeared in the façade of antiisrael invective so prevalent at the un it appeared that france was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the french parliament prime minister manuel valls termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that france will never deny the jewish presence and jewish history in jerusalem it would make no sense it is absurd to deny this history \nfrance is one of europes strongest advocates for the palestinians the palestinian authority and their muslim allies at unesco should have understood from valls statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic european support instead of declaring victory and moving on they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in october \nthe october  resolution  sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the april resolution it condemned israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the jewish and christian nexus to the city this time however the muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution passed the muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the member body \nof the  nations that voted in favor of the resolution mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to   were composed of states with muslim majorities while a fifteenth nigeria is  percent muslim making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time around the resolution failed to garner a single western european concurrence other developing nations like india which had hitherto supported arabsponsored drafts also abstained israels behindthescenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the muslim initiative was paying dividends \nfollowing the resolutions passage the palestinians and their muslim allies suffered additional political reversals mexico  asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion mexicos secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of mexico gives the undeniable link of the jewish people to the cultural heritage of east jerusalem \nbrazil soon followed suit echoing mexicos position in a statement the brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such onesided resolutions italy which had abstained went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister matteo renzi told an italian radio station that these resolutions were incomprehensible unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness \neven unescos directorgeneral irina bokova voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion \non wednesday the palestinian authority and jordan introduced a third draft resolution to unescos world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites the member whc body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move croatia and tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the muslim bloc instead of the motion passing by consensus the vote was  in favor two opposed eight abstentions and one nation absent \nthe two nations opposing were tanzania and the philippines of the  ayes seven were muslim it was a pyrrhic victory at best \ngiven the large number of muslim countries represented at the un and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against israel it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent arab political reversals gone are the days that the palestinians can rely on automatic european and nonaligned support \nisrael has been effectively reaching out to the socalled nonaligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the israeli success lies in the fact that the jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology agriculture energy counterterrorism cyber warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the un \nnevertheless the unesco resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many un member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to israel that it will never allow the un to impose terms and dictates on israel \nthere have been rumors circulating that barack obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on israel utilizing the un security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation \nthe administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed antiisrael resolution likely introduced by france or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying longstanding commitments to israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition the notion that the united states would throw israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant antisemitism to have a say on israels fate is beyond asinine hopefully the outrageous conduct exhibited at unesco steers the administration in the right direction",

    "text": "originally published by the jerusalem post  \nin one of the immortal lines of godfather   mafia boss michael corleone discusses the fate of his brother who betrayed him with his enforcer i dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive corleone said \nmessage received the brother was murdered after their mothers funeral last week it was reported that the obama administration has delivered a message to the palestinian authority the administration has warned the pa that the us will veto any antiisrael resolution brought before the un security council before the us presidential elections on november  message received open season on israel at the security council will commence november  the palestinians are planning appropriately israel needs to plan too israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank president barack obama in his final eight weeks in power lobbying the administration is pointless obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on israel for not supporting his hostile strategically irrational policies and he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones before turning to what israel must do first we need to understand what israel can do a good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at unesco where twice in a week unesco bodies resolved to erase  years of jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount the fight that israel waged at unesco is not the fight it needs to wage at the security council the stakes at the security council are far higher like the un general assembly unescos decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance as such there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them for israel the goal of the fight at unesco is not to defeat antiisrael initiatives that is impossible given the palestinians automatic majority the purpose of the fight at unesco is to humiliate european governments that side with antisemitic initiatives and to weaken the congenitally antiisrael body itself the government achieved both of these objectives italian prime minister matteo renzis disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for israel so too the fact that unescos own secretarygeneral irina bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the jewish peoples ties to jerusalem was a significant victory for israel her statement was deeply damaging for unesco and its reputation finally the fact that tanzania and the philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional propalestinian voting pattern the palestinians won the vote at unesco because they are more powerful diplomatically than israel they have an automatic antiisrael majority but they werent empowered by their victory to the contrary they were bloodied by it in a sign of their weakening hold on member nations the palestinians and jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of unescos world heritage committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution powerful players dont make threats they dont need to israels experience at unesco teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers israel doesnt need to hide in americas shadow it is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the palestinians automatic majority and it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a usbacked assault at the security council unlike unesco the security council can pass legally binding resolutions israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it obamas intention to abandon israel at the security council means that israel comes to this battle severely hobbled but there is one advantage to the uss betrayal over the years israels ability to trust the us to veto antiisrael resolutions at the security council was been a mixed blessing on the one hand the us has secured israel from diplomatic assaults but on the other hand our ability to trust washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective safe in washingtons shadow we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy that is we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys but public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool the syrian regime for instance has no moral case for securing international support bashar assad didnt convince russian president vladimir putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes he bought putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in syria then there is morocco another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make last march un secretarygeneral ban kimoon outraged rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that western sahara which morocco occupies is occupied territory morocco quickly secured the support of spain and france and launched an allout onslaught against ban how did morocco manage moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from north africa to europe anytime it wishes rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut and the french and spanish know it in less than a month ban issued repeated abject apologies game set match morocco from reports to date it appears that shortly after the us elections on november  the malaysians or egyptians will submit a palestinianbacked resolution that defines israeli communities in united jerusalem judea and samaria as illegal if the resolution is brought to a vote the us will fail to veto it such a resolution or a resolution obligating israel to withdraw to the  armistice lines would cause israel grave harm so what resources does israel have to prevent this from happening of course we have public diplomacy and that might work with some friendly nations but it wont get us over the top we need to learn from the syrian and moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer security council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us one such resource is the us congress israels allies in congress are sickened by the obama administrations devastating middle east policies a solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce israels position israel has other resources as well that we can trade on we have natural gas and we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the  century there is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support as for the palestinians as the unesco vote showed they are less popular now than at any time in the past  years all they have to offer is threats and antisemitism both are powerful weapons but they are no longer invincible israels goal must be to use our resources at the security council in a manner that will make it impossible for obama to enable an antiisrael resolution to pass a method for achieving this goal has two components the first component is to convince a friendly country on the security council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the palestinianbacked israelbashing one such a resolution could include four points first it could deplore efforts to deny jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount second it can condemn the paplo for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists third it can urge israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future palestinian state fourth it can call on israel and the pa to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions israel has friendly ties with a few security council members among them uruguay and new zealand in the final weeks of the obama era it is possible that israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines obama would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles israel out for rebuke but that still is insufficient obama can make uruguay and new zealand a better offer if he wishes and so we move to the second aspect of the plan if we learn nothing else from the obama era we must recognize that the time has come for israel to stop sufficing with just one security council veto most states have several and we need a few more russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto putin is a dealmaker as his agreement with assad showed he is willing to consider attractive offers obviously israel wont offer russia bases but we do have other things to offer putin in exchange for a veto for instance in exchange for a russian veto at the security council israel can offer putin to lobby the us congress to cancel us sanctions against russia over russias annexation of crimea israel has no dog in that fight and the sanctions are not getting the us anywhere putin might go for the deal for two reasons first by stepping into the breach and defending israel against obama he will humiliate obama second if israel succeeds with the congress he will reap economic rewards for his part putin wouldnt even have to openly side with israel all he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on israel and the palestinians if putin supports a balanced resolution obama will be checkmated his plan to take revenge on israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled israel will have survived his presidency none of this will be easy and success is far from assured there are many more ways for israel to fail than succeed our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck but as the unesco resolutions showed attacking israel is no longer cost free we are not powerless in the grip of circumstances we have cards to play and now is the time to play them for all they are worth",

    "text": "a look at the universitys new mission october   jack kerwick \njonathan haidt a professor of social psychology at new york university argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth within the last few decades the university has assumed another social justice \nthe university however can only have one telos \nthe conflict between these two goals has raged for decades haidt claims last year though it became unmanageable when student groups at  universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators demands for social justice that by and large were met \nthe following statement is posted at blackliberationcollectiveorg  \nwe demand at the minimum black students and black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of black folk in the state and the country \nwe demand free intuition for black and indigenous students \nwe demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities \na statement of principles follows the black liberation collective blc opposes antiblackness sexism ableism capitalism white privilege inequality and heteronormativity it rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic  \nantiblack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society says the blc when social systems are racialized by white supremacy whiteness becomes the default of humanity and blackness is stripped of its humanity becoming a commodity becoming disposable \nthe blc is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men \nblack liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy \npresumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases \nthese social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks \nnor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression \nit isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles \nthe state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty \nconcerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it \nhaidt misspeaks in characterizing  as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out \nperhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors \nto put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors \nleftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals \nfor all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the  critical race theory  to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a  th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men \nbut theres more to it than this \nthe idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted \nyet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american \nthe social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the  th or early  th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor \nnow they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in social justice",

about herself or he husband was written by a  female indeed women seem to have a particular stake in bringing mr trump down \nthe contrast between mrs trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark in both her interviews with cnns condescending anderson cooper and fox newss ainsley earhardt mrs trump was the embodiment of strength \nwhen a liberal woman declares shes a strong woman usually uttered in a tartlike staccato inflection shes using a cliché look at her actions youll see that strong to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways \na strong liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to forkout for her trojans and her trivora and if birth control fails our liberated libertine then youre on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients and dont dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man any man to doubt her is to harm her \nit was not without significance that hillary clintons first general election speech in june was before planned parenthood at the time media buried the story of one named rajiv k fernando  who had donated to the clinton foundation and was given a seat as hillarys nuclear weapons advisor watching this i was thinking endemic corruption the  trillion debt the dire jobs report the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers but hillary and her gynobrigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayerpaid dilation and curettage dc \nmelania trump on the other hand is authentically strong \nin her refusal to impart salacious tellall tidbits to interviewers in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family in her serene gracious and beautiful manners and bearingmrs trump exemplifies a european womans good breeding shes a class act her enemies are the cultural underclass \nnor does mrs trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her american counterparts there are images on the internet of presidents being inappropriate with women in particular you can watch a grainy youtube clip of barack obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters in another the president with frances nicolas sarkozy is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by much to media chagrin melania refused to get worked up about the  access hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in lockerroom talk \nmen will be men if theyre not saying it theyre thinking it \nmore material than her mien were melania trumps words of reason on the sovietstyle witchhunt launched against her husband with media mediation she said this all sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law to accuse someone man or woman without evidence is damaging and unfair this was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney tom mesereau about the bill cosby pileon quit the feeding frenzy give the man his due process investigate the women counseled mesereau esq at the time \nthe very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted michelle obama the first lady was lauded for an unhinged antitrump address to the nations women in a world where americans have been beheaded on camera women raped en masse on europes streets and christians exterminated in the middle eastthe first lady bewailed being shaken to her shallow core by raunchy words i cant stop thinking about it groaned michelle about mr trumps access hollywood indiscretion it has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted \nthe ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a catholic priest by muslim migrants in france thats something i cant stop thinking about the machinegunning of five macys shoppers and employees by a turkish muslim immigrant arcan cetin in my neck of the woods that has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted again mrs obamas pitiful case against mr trump has strengthened nothing but her dramaqueen credentials \ncandidate clinton crowed that mrs obamas long whinge for women was a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election about who we are as americans indeed the implicit case michelle put to women is this a mammoth national debt a shrinking job market rising lawlessness and racial strife an annual intake of mostly thirdworld immigrants exceeding  million the dangers to life and limb of importing more islam fuhgeddaboudit what counts whimpered michelle obama voice tremblingyes mrs obama almost brought herself to tearswas to ferret out microaggression and find a safeplace to hunker down \nas i write sen elizabeth warren has stormed a stage somewhere for hillary clinton phony pocahontas is hollering about the power of nasty women to immiserate clinton and warren make for a resentful domineering powerhungry pair whove made it big in life through the use of state power the human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same \nwhereas trump rallies are packed with hopefilled beaming faces a clintonwarren affair is festooned with malevolentlooking aggrieved women and their frightened lowt houseboys the background music enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop singer like katy perry whose outoftune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard if not for the marvel of autotune autotune is the holy grail of recording that corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments in real time without distortion or artifacts it was invented by a male

prophet mohammed and his companions whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric thcentury bedouin tribal context exhibited codes of behavior el rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism the most abject crimes of islamic state are but a stcentury remake of what the first muslims accomplished under the guidance of the prophet she writes noting that sexual and domestic slavery the massacre of nonmuslims notably jews pedophilia pillage polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from preislamic societies the book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with islam no exception to their traditional french anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature \nformerly the magazines religion writer el rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management flush with cash from international donations the fundamentally altered publication she disappointedly explained  will probably never again draw the prophet  out of fear of more reprisals \nand those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of mohammed forget that everywhere that islam reigns as the religion of the state caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed el rhazouis book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam religion of peace and love \nwe need to admit that islamism today is applied islam el rhazoui  who describes herself as an atheist of muslim culture writes responding to politicians religious figures islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real islam has nothing to do with such terror \nwhen we apply islam to the letter it gives islamism and when we apply islamism to the letter it gives terrorism so we need to stop saying islam is a religion of peace and love what is a moderate islamist an islamist who doesnt kill \nthe essaylength book is in the grand french polemical tradition of emile zola whose jaccuse denounced the antisemitism of the french state and establishment during the dreyfus affair on the eve of the th century el rhazoui who holds moroccan and french citizenship takes aim at a very stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of islamophobia which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all muslims epitomized by the french collective against islamophobia ccif this deliberate strategy vilifies as islamophobic voices such as el rhazouis who dare question the religion the ccif and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism \nthe notion of islamophobia doesnt even exist in muslim countries the author points out because outside the west criticism of the religion or mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy \nunable to pass blasphemy laws in europe groups like the ccif employ a dangerous semantic confusion she said on the ccif site it is written islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense \nthis is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards islam and muslims yet criticism of an idea of islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime i was born and lived under the islam of morocco and live in france and i have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of islamophobia that says i have no right to criticize if we criticize christianity it doesnt mean we are christianophobes or racist towards the christian race \nthe widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe el rhazoui says \nyou can no longer speak about islam without saying its a religion of peace and love but when you open any book in islam what do you find violence blood oppression of women and hate for other religions \nof course you can find this in other religions however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity as long as we dont talk about this and keep repeating that islam is a religion of peace and love many people will continue to believe the koran is a constitution and that rather than being a book written  centuries ago reflecting a particular context it is a legal constitution to apply today \nzineb el rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead charlie hebdo comrades \nafter completing high school in morocco el rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion obtaining a masters degree from pariss prestigious social science graduate school ehess in her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at le journal hebdomadaire becoming a campaigner for secular liberties such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of ramadan this act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the arab spring in  the wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against ramadan rules prompted her to leave morocco again for france where she began to report for charlie hebdo bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being muslim is not a choice unless youre jewish or christian \nextreme personality cult \nsocalled islamic fascism seen in its most extreme form in groups like isis shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms el rhazoui argues because it combines an intense personality cult around mohammed as the incarnation of the nation it also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation exemplified by sartorial branding  for example burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents there are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals armed militias adoption of a flag and a strategy that confers the benign status of muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the west and characterizes them disingenuously as victimized objects of exclusion \nthe literary corpus of islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma el rhazoui writes \nif the terrorists of daesh isis behead those they judge to be miscreants that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the th surah of the koran alanfal verse  remember what your lord revealed to the angels  i am with you so support those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve you can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip \nyou can be arab muslim and a free thinker \ndrawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of islams core arabic texts the politics of the postarab spring middle east and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted islamic civilization el rhazouis book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead \nthe greatest racism is el rhazoui argues the racism of the islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not muslims and that rejects women that is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it the writer adds \ntoday islam in the world only has a role as a civilization a civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage its artistic culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature \nthe muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women sexual and individual freedom and equality for all no matter your creed or religion until islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it islam will not be acceptable \nislamophobia whiners \ndestroy islamic fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left cryptoislamist antiracists on a quest for a new muslim proletariat certain feminists cultural relativists and socalled moderate imams all these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of islamic state the author says but also makes the lives of millions of muslims living in islamic countries downright miserable \nwhat do these islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in islamic theocracies and dream of liberty el rhazoui concludes in her book who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of algiers casablanca or cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals pariahs of muslim societies who often only have the choice of death prison or exile who speaks about this youth born muslim but dreaming of a normal life these teens attacked for having had a romance \n\n\nthe summer furore over burkini bans in france agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of islamists and their western sympathizers in the media academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by muslim women even though most never wear it \nwestern media in an intolerable readiness to oblige have defended the burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity she said but pointed out that in muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with burkinis but they are emptying themselves of women from one year to another they are disappearing from the public space because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior \nas for mainstream or moderate muslim clerics el rhazoui tells women in the world that during the burkini debate in france not one imam stood up and said hey wait a minute you can be muslim and wear a regular bathing suit \nhistory will judge those who have monopolized the debate given a platform to islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability the author of destroy islamic fascism told women in the world this is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today she said \naccording to the writer who is repeatedly accused of bigotry the islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of islam and what islam with a big i is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within \nthe accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people no fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history the people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability \nfor el rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to islamic culture that decrees an islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa we present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture it is absolutely intolerable she says \nsurvivor syndrome \nwomen in the world asked el rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since january  \nit is a question people often ask me she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice but when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death you realize can put many things in perspective \nstraight after the attacks like many of my colleagues i felt guilty for having stayed alive i said to myself those who are dead are dead for all our work and some are dead when it wasnt even their work but it was my work because i am a journalist and i am still here and then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome which is normal when you survive a massacre like that \nas you start to heal you say i am lucky to be alive and if i am still here perhaps that is because i still have something to do i understood long before the attack on charlie when i engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in morocco that when you fight against totalitarianism whether it is political or religious you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living we fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life \nzineb el rhazoui c attends the funeral of french cartoonist and charlie hebdo editor stephane charb charbonnier on january   in pontoise outside paris martin bureauafpgetty images \nstill a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague charb and their many heated discussions \nhe was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear he was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd \nel rhazouis deconstruction of islam is also a defense of muslims she reasoned as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it \nwe have to extend a hand to all these muslims who are free people who have questioned their heritage and who are fighters for liberty battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by islamists she says \nlife in a moving jail \nsince january  the survivor from charlie hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the freedom forum in europe and the us under the protection assured by the french state and the countries that receive her she says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security \ni always find some spaces of freedom there are always little escape hatches life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since the charlie attacks and recently became a firsttime mother in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in french media \ntoday i wander around in a moving jail  its a moving cage  but in reality i am more free in my head than those who threaten me because their cage is inside their head they have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned i am much freer than them \nfollow emmakate symons on twitter eksymons",

    "text": "propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere october   \nreprinted from israelnationalnewscom  \ncommendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted \nthe bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks \nit has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point \nan islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity \nthis is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight \nthe bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution \nin  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier \nby the late s edward saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations \ni only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel \nas we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired \nsuch lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink \na likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why \nthe two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care \nfair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either \nheres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity \nhe would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible \nhis mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do \ni am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult \nfacts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming \nthis is one of our greatest challenges",

workers \npakistan  the government in the raiwind district flooded a christian graveyard with sewage water and desecrated all the graves in response protesting christians complained that even in the grave they can receive no peace in pakistan \nsudan  authorities insulted forcefully arrested and jailed  christians when they attempted to stop them from seizing an evangelical school on church property which authorities plan on giving to muslim businesses later authorities returned to the same christian school gave letters of dismissal to the christian headmistress vandalized her office and replaced her with a teacher of their own choosing \negypt  after a christian man was stabbed to death and many christian homes and a church burned by angry muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built coptic christian bishop makarious of alminya was interviewed on television church authorities in egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say but makarious made many revealing comments although only christians no muslims were killed and hurt he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other within minutes of the start of one of the attacks  muslims instantly appeared fully armed as if ready for war he added as long as the attackers are never punished and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty this will just encourage others to continue the attacks since even if they are arrested they will be quickly released when the host asked questions about who is released and why suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the christians the bishop replied well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested with complete proofs and evidences against them but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time about this series \nthe persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes \n to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians \n to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia \naccordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof \nbecause these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it \nprevious

note the following letter was sent to the presidents of the ten campuses named in the freedom centers report on the top ten schools supporting terrorists in alphabetical order the ten campuses are brooklyn college cuny san diego state university san francisco state university tufts university university of california berkeley university of california irvine university of california los angeles university of chicago university of tennessee knoxville and vassar college \noctober   \nuniversity of california \ndear dr napolitano \nyour school purports to promote the values of diversity inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources funding and legitimacy to students for justice in palestine students for justice in palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against jews and the jewish state for the terrorist organization hamas the explicit goals of hamas are the destruction of the worlds only jewish state and genocide against its jewish population for these reasons among others three campuses of the university of californiairvine los angeles and berkeleyhave been named among the top ten schools supporting terrorists by the david horowitz freedom center you may read the full report here httpwwwstopthejewhatredoncampusorgnewstoptenschoolssupportingterroristsfallreport \nwhile it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group sjp is an integral part of hamass efforts to annihilate israel through the boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign this is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize israel and smear it as a rogue apartheid nation these claims are ludicrous more than a million palestinians enjoy israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the israeli courts and parliament harvard professor alan dershowitz has said of the bds movement it is antisemitic antizionist antihuman rights antiintellectual antiscience antinegotiation antipeace anticompromise and antipalestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work both larry summers and hillary clinton have denounced bds as antisemitic jew hatred yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors \nwith university support sjp also conducts israeli apartheid hate weeks on campus quads these events feature prohamas advocates the construction of apartheid walls featuring prohamas antisemitic propaganda and the creation of mock checkpoints and dieins that disrupt student movements on campus sjp actively disrupts proisrael campus eventsa threat to free speech and a violation of your universitys stated values and rules of conduct \nin addition to being scripted by hamas terrorists sjps proterror campaign is funded and guided through a hamas front called american muslims for palestine in recent testimony before the house foreign affairs committee jonathan schanzer who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the united states department of the treasury from  described how hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to students for justice in palestine sjp through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine amp for the purpose of promoting bds campaigns on american campuses amp was created by sjp cofounder hatem bazian a proterrorist lecturer at uc berkeley who called for a suicide bombing intifada inside the united states it employs highranking officials from other muslim charities that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists \nschanzer described amp as arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for students for justice in palestine sjp which is the most visible arm of the bds campaign on campuses in the united states he detailed how amp provides speakers training printed materials a socalled apartheid wall and grants to sjp activists and even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with sjp and other probds campus groups across the country furthermore according to an email it sent to subscribers amp spent  on campus activities in  alone \nstudents for justice in palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas students for justice in palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges including university offices and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of hamas on university property these privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them \nin light of these facts we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to sjp and other campus groups who promote the genocidal hamas agenda and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of jewish students on your campus but of all americans \ndavid horowitz ceo the david horowitz freedom center sherman oaks california",

    "text": "meet hillary clintons secretary of state send a  million check to iran october   daniel greenfield \ndaniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam \nseptember   has come and gone countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the countrys tallest skyscrapers once stood some have burned to ash others had their throats slashed by islamic terrorists still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another islamic terror attack from taking place \nbut joe has an idea joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy \nthe senator from delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in wilmington his formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights his teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly after a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the senate seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with and therefore a man to be listened to \neven if you wish he would shut up \nim groping here joe says for once he isnt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs massaging squeezing caressing instead hes talking about foreign policy the chair of the senate foreign relations committee has no clue \njoe is worried that the muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us and he has a plan to make them feel better \nseems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran senator joe biden says \nthe remark isnt quite as random as it seems the senator from delaware a state not known for its large muslim or iranian population has a friendly relationship with the iran lobby that relationship will only grow friendlier during the bush era as he attacks america and appeases its enemies \niranianamericans who hate the jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a proiranian lobbyists home in california while treasonously attacking his own government for naming iran one of the members of the axis of evil \njoes usual amtrak obsession wouldnt get him in the door in california but treason hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside delaware and joe remains very fond of iran \nhe informs israeli officials that israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran and thats all the way back in  before the deal that puts iran on the path to a shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in obamas eye and a radioactive itch in hillarys socks \nthat was a big year for biden it was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the white house joe had tried it in  and was stomped by dukakis of all people after being caught plagiarizing a speech by british politician neil kinnock  got him a useless position in the white house as a consolation prize \nthis time around joe biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from hillary clinton that she got from barack obama the office of secretary of state of the united states \nof all the jobs that joe biden wants and is utterly unfit for amtrak train engineer secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar its hard to think of one that hes less fit for \njoe biden blamed darfur on the gingrich revolution he fell in love with the taliban \nthe taliban per se is not our enemy joe insisted there is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the taliban is our enemy \nhe suggested that  of the taliban were probably okay and only  were incorrigible most of the taliban he seemed to think were like joe biden just in it for the money \nbut joe biden has a soft spot for islamic terrorists whether theyre the shiite jihadists of iran or the sunni jihadists of the taliban joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back \nit wasnt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on bushs ruination of relations with the rest of the world if biden were to become secretary of state he would become the third democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician the last time a professional held down the job would have been the bush administration \nand yet perversely each loser secretary has been more incompetent than the last hillarys disastrous time as secretary of state could only be exceeded by john kerry who gave away everything to the russians and who was contradicted by the white house so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man or just any man the only loser who could follow two class acts like that was joe biden \njoe bidens amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another even his visit to israel a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by american politicians became an international incident with biden sulking in his room while hillary yelled at prime minister netanyahu for  minutes over the phone but somehow biden with his gift for appeasing iran and the taliban alienates allies \njust this year joe biden launched yet another attack on israel a cynic might almost think that tehran joe loves islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them \nbiden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat he accused president bush of being shortsighted for using the military to fight islamic terrorists he argued that the perception that we want to stay in iraq helps al qaeda some years later his administrations decision to pull out led to the rise of isis he called for closing gitmo while insisting that it had become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world \nsenator joe biden was a voice for appeasement vice president joe biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of islamic terror secretary of state joe biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies he could even write that check to iran though the obamabiden era has seen cash transfers to iran that make joes  million check seem like chump change \nhillary clintons rise doesnt just mean that she will be making big decisions it will mean that joe biden will have gone from a wilmington shyster to running the foreign policy of a country he has betrayed",

    "text": "a resolution on jerusalem that will fuel antijewish incitement and violence october   joseph puder \nif anyone doubted the fact that the united nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiisrael and antijewish animus the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco vote on jerusalem proved it the unesco world heritage committee voted this week october   on a resolution dealing with jerusalem drafted by the palestinian and jordanian delegations and submitted by kuwait lebanon and tunisia all arab muslim states the executive committee of unesco approved  for  opposed  abstained and  missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which  memberstates approved the resolution algeria bangladesh brazil cuba chad dominican republic egypt iran lebanon malaysia morocco mauritius mexico mozambique nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan qatar russia senegal south africa sudan and vietnam  opposed estonia germany lithuania the netherlands uk and the us among the abstaining  states were argentina france greece india japan kenya south korea spain sri lanka and sweden \nthe resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths \naccording to hillel neuer executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights neuer added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines \nthe expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of solomon stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths \nthe latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david \namong the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths \npreceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history \nunescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco \nearlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site \nunesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference \nwhereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday \ndore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem \nmost dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution",

diplomat \npartisan hack james carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories \ni think it is an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for fbi director james comey thats what i think \nhe added this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election it ought to be called for what it is \njust this past july comey was praised by democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue clinton there is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of clinton and the endlessly corrupt bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation which functions as a bribe processing center for wouldbe president hillary clinton \nbut democrats have suddenly flipped sides denouncing comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails \ncarville long known as the ragin cajun is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election \nthe old clinton hand may be right \ninvestigators found  emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former rep anthony weiner d and his wife longtime senior hillary aide huma abedin the computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl \nunderlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter reports the wall street journal  some of the information emailed may have been classified \nabedin who has intergenerational ties to the muslim brotherhood reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop \nover the objections of attorney general loretta lynch comey notified congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among fbi employees the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power \nlynch is doing her best to make sure the department of justice probe goes nowhere \nassistant attorney general for legislative affairs peter j kadzik whom zero hedge calls the best friend of john podesta hillarys campaign chairman and former white house chief of staff in bill clintons administration is heading up the email probe \nso the fix is in \nin any event the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted comey to act \npeople are upset at comey because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the clinton team and the obama white house in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing \nit was back on july  comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent he said even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent the next day attorney general lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against hillary lynch as everyone now knows had a clandestine meeting with former president bill clinton at a phoenix airport a week before at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made \nthis internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that comey felt he had to act immediately \ni have some sources in the fbi and the former district attorneys commentator larry kudlow said sunday on nbcs meet the press the fbi is in full revolt right now the fbi has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer \never the hillary shill host chuck todd corrected kudlow \nnot full revolt he said theres been a lot i mean itsthere are agentslets not say full revolt \nall right a semifull revolt said kudlow \nbecause what im getting at is if comey hadnt said what he said to congress and the rest of the world it would have leaked it would have leaked that whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with anthony weiner and huma abedin so i dont think comey had much chance here and i think the fbi is badly divided \nmeanwhile the trickle of bad news for hillary clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days \nclinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the donald trump campaign top democrat operatives robert creamer and scott foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents the euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators the homeless and the mentally ill to cause melees at trump rallies \nfomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteilung or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers \nlongtime democrat pollster and campaign consultant doug schoen a familiar face on fox news channel announced he could no longer in good conscience support clintons candidacy \nim deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected he said sunday if the secretary of state wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with top aide huma abedin under criminal investigation \nrepublican donald trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters \nclintons unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds trumps shes at  percent hes at  percent \nformer new york mayor and leading trump surrogate rudy giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from wikileaks and the fbi to indict clinton for racketeering bill clinton does the speeches they put the money in the pocket she does the favors in the government said giuliani a former federal prosecutor it all links up why did they destroy  emails because it shows the link \ninfluential liberal journalist ron fournier threw hillary under the bus mrs clinton got a secret server to protect what the washington post called the circle of enrichment he said \nif hillary clinton wins next week media outlets across america will have to hire extra investigative journalists to handle all the corruption exposes that will follow",

    "text": "how the nevertrumpers sunk themselves november   \nbruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center \nthe chorus of nevertrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and hillarys supposed victory approach after more than a year of complaining about trump crashing their political soiree the republicans attacking trump still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the republican masses \na recent example comes from premier nevertrumper bret stephens of the wall street journal  in his column stephens bids farewell to a republican party stupid enough to nominate trump contrasting it with his imagined golden age of republican policy excellence that trump and his followers have destroyed one policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make trump the nominee \nat a  republican primary debate in houston candidates george hw bush and ronald reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free mr bush said they should were creating a whole society of really honorable decent familyloving people that are in violation of the law he lamented \nreagan agreed instead of putting up a fence he asked why dont we    make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while theyre working and earning here they pay taxes here for good measure reagan suggested we should open the border both ways \nwhere in the populist fervor to build a wall with mexico and deport millions of human beings is that republican party today \ntake bush seniors statement first it repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan gang of eight recycled in  during their push for comprehensive immigration reform another euphemism for amnesty all those hardworking familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows as john mccain said and start voting republican the political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love \nthis stance on illegal immigration by republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people take mccains oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows seriously illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities and living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported theyll soon be back remember juan francisco lopezsanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered kate steinle or angel gilberto garciaavalos another fivetime deportee who just this month started a  million fire in sequoia national park he had just been released from the kern county jail but could not be deported because of californias lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents \nsimply repeating the hardworking family values religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration there are such illegal immigrants as i know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the san joaquin valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country i grew up with mexicanamericans theyre members of my immediate family theyre my friends students and colleagues theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border \nsome illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not a rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff but bush mccain and stephens have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go that means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows but all those guilty of duis hitandruns or defrauding the welfare system with fake ids will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous  immigration act which enshrined family reunification with no limits on relatives of us citizens \nequally tonedeaf is stephenss bringing up ronald reagans open the border both ways thats exactly what he did in  when he signed the simpsonmazzoli act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of border enforcement that never materialized stephens doesnt mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about  million to  million creating todays crisis the obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the  million it would be governmental malfeasance to repeat reagans mistake \nthe problem with politicians and pundits like stephens is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores people like stephens dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of broken windows such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars hitandruns driving without insurance gangbanging and dealing drugs \nand if mr stephens thinks im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist i dare him to visit the san joaquin valley better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month come and tour a hospital emergency room a social security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these honorable decent familyloving people it would take just a week for mr stephens to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun then again he wouldnt last that long within a day hed scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening \nand that hypocrisy is where trump came from in the perception of millions of votersperceptions nevertrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters and so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become obama  and continue the progressive destruction of the constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party what sort of principle is that",

    "text": "obama wont vote with america at the un under obama the united states wont defend the united states november   daniel greenfield \ndaniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam \na generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders \non a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un \nun member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain samantha power said \nthank you she added acknowledging the applause \nunder obama the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc \ninstead of defending america obamas chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy \nlet me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said \nif the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador power if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc \nthe cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable \nben rhodes the close obama adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose \nwho is this we \nthe cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors \nthis we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one \none member of the we must be ben rhodes because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed obama to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america \nno one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states \nwe is obama who made the final decision its ambassador samantha power its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un \namerica has a we problem \nif the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country \nwhen president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work \nthese days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists \nthats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works \nthe first word in the introduction to obamas presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i obamas basis for his authority is his  announcement letat cest moi obama is the state \njfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of  \nthe i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master \nin obamas directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack obama there is no law only obama \nnow the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but ben rhodes who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip obama has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but ben rhodes isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in america one is us the other is we \nwe does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours \nwe happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back \nyou can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america \npresident kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy  we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice \nkennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc \nit is easy to sit here in the distant future of  and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left \nby backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked \nbut the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired  \nwhat we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in  summed up as a boot stamping on a human face  forever \npresident kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador power cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba \nthe cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their communist overlords the question is will

    "text": "dawn perlmutter \nthe war on law enforcement is epidemic every aspect of culture has been infected the antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media in memes in movements in popular fast food restaurants at football games on campuses in media and in every aspect of american culture \nan epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time colin kaepernick is the typhoid mary of the antipolice epidemic kaepernick refuses to stand while the us national anthem is being performed at the start of nfl games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality on sept  kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench his explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current us military members as if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting he misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission similar to hands up dont shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning the media reverently refers to kaepernicks protest as taking a knee as if it is some kind of sacred act there are no headlines that read kaepernick disses the flag or kaepernick takes a crap on his country just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies he has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant black panther party to socks that depict police as pigs in addition to numerous other crimes the black panther party was responsible for the murder of at least  officers and originated the expression off the pigs meaning murder police \nlike the typhoid infected cook mary mallon kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen in what has been dubbed the kaepernick effect dozens of nfl and wnba players have knelt sat or raised a fist during the national anthem the disease has also spread to over  high schools  colleges and one middle school in what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the star spangled banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing one of the women denasia lawrence not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a black lives matter tshirt exposing miami heat fans to the contagious disorder \nrapid spread is well known for infectious diseases the antipolice disorder also contaminated the navy an unidentified sailor assigned to the naval air technical training center in pensacola florida filmed herself deliberately not standing for the national anthem and posted it on facebook she remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised colin kaepernick another sailor petty officer nd class janaye ervin an intelligence specialist in the navy reserve stationed at pearl harbor did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform she also posted a statement on facebook saying she was inspired by colin kaepernick the navy acted decisively she lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions it is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it \nkaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order \nearly symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified \nthe antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants employees have refused to serve officers at a taco bell in phenix city al dunkin donuts in west hartford ct krispy kreme in columbia sc ihop in virginia beach va arbys in pembroke pines fl chuck e cheese in bowling green ky whataburger in lewisville tx mcdonalds in brenham tx chipotle in brooklyn ny genghis grill in dallas tx noodles  company in alexandria va tropical smoothie in winter haven fl luckys teriyaki sedrowoolley wa and at the krystal restaurant in irondale al other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a philadelphia starbucks refusing service at a sunoco gas station in miramar fl writing black lives matter on an officers coffee cup at a dunkin donuts in providence ri and a walmart bakery in mcdonough ga refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party these are just the incidents that have been made public \nrefusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic \nthe antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and kaepernick \nas the disease progresses more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence a particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in philadelphia chicago albuquerque fresno denver new orleans oakland austin honolulu rochester san diego st paul covington richmond goshen fayetteville raleigh and many other cities across the country vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint toppling and scratching granite burning to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame in a previous article  i described these acts as symbolic assassinations vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of this is another symptom of the antipolice disease a sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers \nat its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic",

    "text": "obamas secret muslim list why enemies of israel and irans goto guy appeared on the list november   daniel greenfield \ndaniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam \nlike a warped islamic version of santa claus obama had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments \nit included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood \nit was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them \nobama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american \nwhen i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror \nwe dont have religious tests he insisted \nexcept we did and we do obama also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between  and  muslim with only  christians and  yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war \nsyria is  christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only  have made it past obamas iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence \nbut would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test \nof course he would \nthe hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees \nthe list was sent to john podesta who headed the obamabiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian \nhow shameful how not american of barack hussein obama \nmost who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta \nreligious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians \nthats the pattern which emerged from the obamabiden transition project and obamas refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations \nthis policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies \nadministration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates \nobama appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders \nthe muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in  fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood \nhe cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati  director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists  its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on obamas muslim list \nalso listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state \nthe second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised obama on iranian sanctions \nobama had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that obama must apologize for \nthe other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout \neboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the obama administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair \ndilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to obamas advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc \nalso on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure \nthe recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet obama had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims \nthis represents behavior that is in obamas own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles obama is shameful and not american",

decision courageous and bigger than watergate clinton the doj democrat senators and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection calling the announcement appalling absurd strange deeply troubling an attack and unprecedented the bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to trumps side and put him in the white house \ntheres no doubt that comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying not because it is unprecedented as the democrats keep squealing they had no such qualms when the weekend before the  election special prosecutor lawrence walsh indicted a pollsurging george hw bush for his alleged involvement in the irancontra scandal no the mystery is comeys motives is comey like conrads lord jim now sacrificing his fbi careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office reputation and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled fbi investigators to quote one of our candidates at this point what difference does it make \nthe real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters right now we dont know if the content of the  emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter anthony weiner estranged husband of clinton vizier huma abedin will reveal something damning like say classified materials but we already know that clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server which didnt bother comey back in july so what could be in these new emails that rises above comeys sophistic extreme carelessness and reaches the statutes gross negligence or has comey found new evidence of hillarys intent his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law there had to be something that made comey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the democrats \nwhatever is found on the abedin laptop one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters they have shrugged off so many scandals lies and failures that should have sunk a candidacy that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence unpleasantness dishonesty sleaze and crime is disqualifying anymore here are the greatest hits from hillarys catalogue whitewater missing billing records from her tenure at the rose law firm renting out the lincoln bedroom to donors travelgate illegal possession of fbi files conducting illegal secret meetings of the task force on national health care reform cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering stealing  worth of china furniture and artwork from the white house claiming she landed under sniper

staffs incestuous relationship with the media her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions and last but not least the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health \nback in the day just a few of these gaffes deceptions and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for congress let alone the white house \nand mr trumps offenses hes talks exactly as youd expect a new york real estate developer casino owner reality television star and beauty pageant mogul to talk hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what bill clinton and every whitehousevisiting rapper movie star or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity when youre a star they let you do it as trump bragged of his crude sexual advances hes ignorant of policy he doesnt understand the economics of global trade he doesnt know what the nuclear triad is hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives he wants to build a wall with mexico he takes legal advantage of tax law hes not suitable for office he does not have the right temperament hes used bankruptcy as a business tool hes accused of groping over a dozen women including a polymorphously perverse porn star hes mean and insulting he has orange hair \nin short trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices just ask hillarys various secret service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be \nthe voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous but whatever happens its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates \nthis transformation happened decades before trump and hillary came along after bill clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the white house his approval ratings were  he left the white house with a  rating higher than any president since harry truman including ronald reagan think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the soviet union into its own dustbin of history \nthat was the inflection point for our political culture no wonder that barack obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement leftwing views selfconfessed drug use friends like the antiamerican racist jeremiah wright and unrepentant terrorist bill ayers and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to  million voters so why now are we shocked shocked that offbrand candidates like hillary clinton and donald trump are vying for the presidency decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue wisdom and decorum have already long gone \nso absent a smoking howitzer in the next wikileaks dump comeys restart of the investigation which in any case will take months to complete will probably not be the gamechanging october surprise many hope for and others dread especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate then again the rapid erosion of hillarys support is drawing analogies to reagans late surge against carter \neither way on november  most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me or they might just finally realize that hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable but what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess",

acknowledge his wifes key role in hrcs inner circle with john podesta and huma abedin his october  sacramento bee piece suggests markos is right at home in those circles \nkounalakis attacks the republican presidential nominee implying that he is crazy and a tool of the evil putin on the other hand the clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy american society has made great strides in lgbtq rights womens rights and minority rights and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy \nthe author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged clinton crony maybe markos will join his wife huma abedin and john podesta in the wikileaks revelations for many observers the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic if markos kounalakis believes they are bogus maybe he can write about whats in the real ones",

    "text": "search form search from bad to worse  obamas ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg in his bid to pursue a legacy obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon november   ari lieberman \nmost of us including several democratic lawmakers cringed when obama inked the iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the iranian regime recoiled in horror when we learned that obama transferred  million to the iranians in exchange for four american citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges the  million was part of a larger installment totaling  billion ostensibly to settle claims iran had against the united states stemming from aborted iranian arms purchases dating back to the shah obama claimed that this was money that was owed to iran and the settlement which included  billion in interest saved the us taxpayer billions because the iranians were demanding even more at the hague tribunal where the claim was being adjudicated \nthe timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geopolitical concerns the americans were freed only after iran received its  million the payment which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane was made in untraceable cash stacked on wooden pallets the iranians demanded swiss francs and euros rather than dollars and a pliant obama agreed to the islamic republics dictates gleeful iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom contradicting the administrations adamant denials \neven within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom state department spokesman mark toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the  million was used as leverage to ensure the americans safe return the white house however quickly repudiated the state departments characterization \neven if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the us to extortion and hostagetaking the iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not every twobit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well \nbut there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story in his january   address to the american people obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the islamic republic but as noted by rick richman in an excellent article featured in mosaic  the deal struck with the iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the american people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement \nthe  million that the us transferred to iran came from irans foreign military sales fms account with the pentagon the balance of  billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since  but obama neglected to note that when iran filed its lawsuit the us filed counterclaim against iran for  million for iranian breaches of its obligations under the fms program the us could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the american treasury courtesy of the islamic republic \nmoreover american plaintiffs maintained sixteen us court judgments against the islamic republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities those judgments totaled  billion in compensatory and punitive damages \nsome plaintiffs sought to recover their judgments directly from irans fms account but their efforts were stymied by the clinton administration instead under a convoluted deal struck between congress and the clinton administration in  the us treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and  percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the fms fund the judgments would then be subrogated to the united states which meant that judgments became direct us claims against the iranian government \niran ignored the judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs under us law the  million sitting in the fms account should have gone back to the us treasury which had already paid the judgment holders but the us treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to iran essentially the us taxpayer ended up footing the bill for irans terrorism while the iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence \nobamas actions represented blatant disregard for the law for the victims of terrorism and for the american taxpayer his claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity \nobama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures but as noted by richman the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle iranian claims instituted at the hague exposing yet another lie by the obama administration \nthere was one and only one reason why the iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is the iranians are the worlds foremost statesponsors of international terrorism they finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing hence they demanded untraceable cash the misery that we are currently witnessing in syria yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the obama administration which provided the iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing \nin addition to the  billion in cash obama also authorized the release of seven convicted iranian felons and expunged warrants on  others but this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal \nlastly the transfer of such a large sum to iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing loretta lynchs signature authorizing such payment on october  sen marco rubio r fla and rep mike pompeo r kan presented lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal lynch whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries \nin a desperate attempt to establish a legacy obama pursued the iran deal with reckless abandon forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in us diplomatic history the ancillary deal struck with the iranians concerning american hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the iranians to continue their reign or regional terror more importantly it may also have been in violation of existing us law and lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that notion",

    "text": "netanyahus critical foreign tour israels strategic repositioning \noriginally published by the jerusalem post  \nprime minister benjamin netanyahus upcoming trips to australia singapore kazakhstan and azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office the trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it the states that he will visit are all wellpositioned to help israel navigate its next moves the first shift is the uss political crackup \nnext week american voters will choose their next president the major candidates democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land their rise is a testament to the weakening if not the unraveling of the glue that has held america together since the civil war the unraveling of the us electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of us military power the uss multitrillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the middle east over the past  years has come at the expense of military modernization the f program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds and it has yet to produce a reliable airplane worse the fs long and problematic gestation period has given russia and china the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the fs stealth systems those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the us and its allies the deterioration of the uss military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the uss apparent loss of strategic rationality this is apparent worldwide but is nowhere more obvious than in the middle east president barack obamas decision to effectively abandon the uss major allies in the middle east in favor of cultivating ties with iran has made the region far more dangerous to the us and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago true in theory obamas decision to prefer the shiites to the sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of sunni jihadism but in light of the genocidal totalitarian and imperial nature of the current iranian regime his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive moreover obamas willingness to rack up the uss national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup in other words even under the best circumstances it is hard to imagine that the us will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade the implications for israel are far reaching for decades israels strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on us power this strategic posture is no longer tenable the second major international shift is russias sudden rise as the primary global power in the middle east as channel  reported sunday night russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of israels air and naval operations in a matter of months israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades the air force reportedly is convinced that the fs stealth systems will be able to neutralize russias detection capabilities but given the welldocumented current problems with the fs stealth systems this conviction is unwise and even under the best circumstances in which israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its f without american interference it will take israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving russian systems present to our air force according to channel s report air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events rather than panicking though israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation the obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that russias military primacy does not reach specifically israel needs to expand massively its capacity for undertheradar operations the first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities particularly human intelligence capabilities israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region second israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies ability to strike us israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems israels reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies military chain of command as possible if our offensive capabilities are being checked so must the capabilities of our enemies indeed our enemies need to be subverted part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in iran at the same time israel should be empowering antiregime sectors in iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the  islamic revolution third israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores it needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment and it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of russian regional primacy fourth israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power it needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with asia such economic growth and power will positively influence russias willingness to allow israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies  and russias allies in lebanon syria and beyond in other words the more economically powerful israel is the more russia will be willing to side with israel against hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the russian umbrella this then brings us to netanyahus upcoming trips each state that he will visit has something to offer israel in expanding its intelligence cyberwarfare and economic capabilities australia a major western economy is moving toward china as america has become less engaged in the pacific israel has an acute interest in using australia as a platform for expanding its ties to china and other asian countries both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to chinas strategic importance to russia as for singapore israel effectively built the singaporean military in the s and s the country remains extremely supportive of israel like australia singapore has close ties to china it has technological and other capabilities that can be extremely advantageous for israel today azerbaijan and kazakhstan are critically important to israel today their strategic proximity to iran and their ties to russia along with their ethnic composition and their natural resources make securing good relations with both critical to israels ability to advance and security its strategic interests in every sphere israel has tremendous assets to offer each of the four countries that netanyahu will visit these assets must be deployed wisely to ensure that israel gains as much as possible from his trip and from its future ties with all of them given the dramatic changes in the global power balance and their implications for israel netanyahus decision to fly to visit these four countries just after the us elections tells us that he gets it at a time of regional and global turbulence and uncertainty in the context of swiftly multiplying threats this is no small matter",

investigative project on terrorism \nisraeli human rights group btselem recently appeared before a special session of the united nations security council excoriating israel and pleading with the body to act against israels settlements \nin  the un famously declared that zionism is racism and four decades later the organization continues to hound israel in each of the last four years as the syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning israel as those rebuking the rest of the world \nthe uns cultural body unesco recently passed a motion ignoring any jewish or christian historical ties to east jerusalem holy sites referring to the temple mount and western wall only by their muslim names and condemning israel as the occupying power it turns out that some of israels leftwing ngos worked to help produce the unesco motion \ngiven the uns chronic hostility efforts by israeli ngos to persuade the un to act against israel are arguably treasonous indeed one attorney and activist for israels leftleaning labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against btselem arguing that the ngo has harmed state sovereignty tried to give land away to a foreign entity and taken steps that could cause a war \nisraeli democracy is extremely tolerant to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups last march several israeli arab knesset members condemned arab states for labeling hizballah a terrorist organization even though it has been at war with israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities \nlast february members from the joint arab list paid a solidarity visit to relatives of palestinian terrorists whom israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering israelis in  mk hanin zoabi balad drew praise from hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing israeli youths were not terrorists hamass connection to the young mens abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between israel and hamas in gaza \nthus israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention nevertheless foreign interests have identified israeli ngos as the soft underbelly of israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas the problem became so acute that a watchdog ngo monitor was formed in  to track the selfhostility being funded largely by european and other foreign sources as the organization notes ngos lack a system of checks and balances andprovide accountability to their funders and activist members and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities \nngo monitor also notes that even though most of the foreign government funding for these israeli ngos is formally designated for educating the israeli public and changing public opinion both in violation of the norms on noninterference in other democracies these israeli ngos are very active externally in the delegitmization and political warfare against israel \nthese leftwing israeli ngos receive money from about two dozen foreign governments  and some private organizations  that includes millions of dollars from billionaire george soros \nin catch the jew  author tuvia tenenbom exposed how foreignfunded human rights and cultural organizations in israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking israel by presenting himself to interview subjects as tobi the german tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions for example the new fund for cinema and tv a foreignfunded israeli cultural ngo told him that that about  percent of political documentaries made in israel are coproduced by europeans that includes a documentary called what makes a hero which equates israels military with the nazis such films would be too scandalous to be produced in germany but germansponsored ngos can safely pay leftwing israelis to make such movies \nsome foreign funders of israeli ngos have even unwittingly enriched hamas last august hamas allegedly siphoned off tens of millions of dollars from world vision a usbased charity and used the funds for weapons purchases tunnel construction and other military activities \nthe knesset passed a law in july requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for ngos that get more than half of their money from overseas the law is clearly aligned with the american foreign agents registration act fara wrote legal scholar eugene kontorovich who defended the legislation in response to critics \nisrael is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups he wrote for example the european union alone has in recent years given roughly  million euro a year for political ngos in the us and roughly an order of magnitude more in israela vastly larger per capita amount \nthe obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view obama opposed netanyahus speech to the us congress against the iranian nuclear deal but was happy to give a speech to the uk parliament against brexit the obama administration critiqued israels ngofundingdisclosure law  perhaps because it had sent us taxpayer money to an israeli ngo working to oust israels prime minister \nthe same hypocrisy seems to prevail among israels foreignfunded ngos they ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful coexistence but are conspicuously silent when palestinian institutions violate those ideals such silence enables abuse by palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which israelis operate foreignfunded israeli ngos remained silent after the palestinian authority arrested palestinians who visited a sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence \nthese organizations are silent when the palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them netanyahu said these organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights but only in shaming israel and libeling it around the world \nif israels leftwing ngos truly are committed to democracy and peace why havent they condemned the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel in  jibril rajoub the deputy secretary of the fatah central committee and the head of the palestinian supreme council for sport and youth affairs condemned a coexistencepromoting soccer match between israeli and palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz as a crime against humanity \nlast week a palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with israeli defense minister avigdor liberman the jerusalembased newspaper alquds was denounced by hamas  the palestinian journalists syndicate and the supposedly moderate pa the chilling effects and antipeace message implicit in the harsh reactions to the interview have yet to catch the attention of any leftwing ngos supposedly working for peace and democracy",

    "text": "go to article \nparents who plan on refinancing their homes in order to send their children off to college should instead consider encouraging them to specialize in a trade \nspeaking as a phd in philosophy who has spent the last  years teaching at the college level im perhaps the last person from whom advice of this sort is expected but it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that i beseech the college bound and their enablersi mean their supportersto revisit their plans \nwhether one regards a postsecondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any more specifically it is a bastion of political correctness a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition \nfor the last  years professor duke pesta who is currently an associate professor of english at the university of wisconsin oshkosh has taught literature at a range of colleges at the outset of each semester he would quiz his students on their knowledge of american and western history what he found is that the overwhelming number of them believed that slaveryan institution mind you that is as old as humanity itself was practiced in virtually every society the planet over and that lasted only some  years in the united states was an exclusively american phenomenon  \nmost of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of america pesta told the college fix his students are convinced that slavery was an american problem that more or less ended with the civil war and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the colonial era \ntheir entire education about slavery he adds was confined to america \nyet it isnt just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery over at boston university saida grundy  an assistant professor of sociology and africanamerican studies tweeted that slavery is a white peoplething \ngrundy didnt stop there she asks is white peoples new deflection from dealing with slavery that all races have had slaves thing is this the new alllivesmatter \nprofessor grundy added other enlightening tweets \nfor the record no race outside of europeans had a system that made slavery a personhood instead of temporary condition \nthere is also no race except europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life \nbefore europeans invented it as such slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child \nin case white folks couldnt follow the thrust of her rant grundy offers a summation of her sophisticated position \nin other words deal with your white sht white people slavery is a yall thing \nin addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white europeans grundy claimed that white masculinity is the problem for americas colleges \nover at the university of pittsburgh students who were distributing prodonald trump materials were harassed and attacked  the trump supporters were accused of backing a racist candidate who espouses hate speech they were greeted by chants of fk the white male patriarchy and eventually physical aggression \none of the victims said that my campus shouldnt be a place where my friends and i are fearful for having opposing opinions \nthese students were accosted by other students students elsewhere however have had professors with which to contend \nat the university of california at los angeles ucla a political science professor michael chwe wrote in a blog post for princeton university press that the danger to democracy itself is posed by trump supporters this danger is real and must be confronted chwe maintains that trump and his supporters are the greatest danger to democracy since world war ii even perhaps since the civil war \nchwe thinks that had we done a better and earlier job with confronting as opposed to accommodating white and male privilegewe might not have reached this situation the trump phenomenon we must set our sights on combatting these forms of privilege now though if we hope to divert democracy away from selfdestruction \nand it isnt just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that cant resist injecting their politics into the classroom a math professor at mount holyoke college an allfemale school was recently captured on video launching into an antitrumpproclinton tirade in class while he never referred to either candidate by name peter rosnicks choice for president was plain this election rosnick said is the scariest that hes ever witnessed he told his students that they should vote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of um should not be objectified \nrosnick also prescribed his students to vote for whoever you want but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrantsthat this is a country that couldnt that wouldnt be what it is if it wasnt for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country \nat least one of rosnicks students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts speaking on condition of anonymity this student told the college fix that she found it highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for \nindeed \nbut this unfortunately is hardly an anomaly in  thus parents should think hard before divesting themselves of tens and tens of thousands of dollars so that their children can become targets of political indoctrination",

    "text": "go to article \nnothing ought to be plainer and yet nothing is more obscured than the meaning of the islamic concept of jihad even if its meaning were at all unclear every day islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is the confusion arises of course from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign making books such as william kilpatricks the politically incorrect guide to jihad so vitally necessary \nkilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book which not only explains from islamic texts and teachings why isis and boko haram and other jihad terror groups are not only not unislamic as is frequently claimed but quintessentially islamic  for the quran as kilpatrick explains commands jihad and muhammad who is considered in islamic theology to the perfect man to be imitated by muslims whenever wherever and however possible not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself \nkilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation  notably the question of why if islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of islamic law most muslims are peaceful peaceful islam kilpatrick points out which western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists is a holdover from the longdead colonial era indeed so the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers who werent going away in the foreseeable future once they did abscond however the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed and saudifunded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling muslims back to jihad the forgotten obligation of warfare against unbelievers \nthe politically incorrect guide to jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among muslims or discrimination against them and indeed that no conciliation or concession on the part of western nonmuslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative since it is rooted in islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds \nthe most valuable sections however of this useful and engaging book are the second jihad without bombs and the third defeating jihad for even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the western landscape more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that western governments indefatigably pursue and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered and usually prevented outright honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat kilpatrick points out that according to reporters without borders the us has dropped to fortysixth place in press freedom one of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat and its ongoing campaign every time there is a jihad attack to inundate us with articles explaining that islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence nothing at all \nbut kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting the churches are in on the act as well christians writes kilpatrick have been lulled into complacency by the oftrepeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of muslims  an emphasis all too many church leaders including of course pope francis relentlessly hammer home heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually spiritually and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat \nthats why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed strategies for victory first weve got to get serious the west suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could in the end be fatal the frivolity is at the top fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media the government and the church are fostering for their own ends the politically incorrect guide to jihad is the perfect book for those who dont know just how bad things are and how likely they are to get even worse  as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness it can be done william kilpatrick does it quite well in this book",

    "text": "go to article \ndaniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam \nonce upon a time factchecking meant that newspapers radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead \nbut factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the roman empire errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty there is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting \nthe media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures the fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents the media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others \nfact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate these days theyre only expected to be politically correct the media deploys fact checks to check political correctness not facts its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan but subjective matters of opinion \nconsider politicos often mocked fact check of donald trump as to whether isis was indeed unbelievably evil under a banner headline donald trumps week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths it zoomed in on a quote from his florida rally \nwere presiding over something that the world has not seen the level of evil is unbelievable trump had said \npolitico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check judging one level of evil against another is subjective but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as isis \nthere were no facts being checked here because politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is \nthe only information conveyed by this fact check is that politico like the rest of the media does not like donald trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue \nin the daily show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility \nthe isis evil fact check of trump came from the same media outlet whose white house reporter decided that the wisconsin flag which carries the date  to mark the states admission to the union was a flag for the local union wisconsin  politico ran an entire story asserting that obama was flying a labor flag to oppose governor walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history \nthis is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to republicans rather than to themselves \nfactchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism like objectivity which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose edward r murrow is jon stewart todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on twitter aspire to found their own vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative \nfact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks thats why the washington post decided to fact check a saturday night live gag about obamas illegal alien amnesty its not that anyone imagines that saturday night live is in the business of producing facts that need checking the post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt obama and his agenda \nits the same reason that the paper fact checked a yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by obama on twitter this isnt about the facts its paranoia about social media narratives going viral \nthis is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives \nmedia outlets trade on their history but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way \nthe new yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts but what use is such a thing at david remnicks new yorker whose big draw comes from andy borowitzs insipid near parodies the new republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog cbs news cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on hillarys face to help her cope with stress \nthis isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda leftwing journalism like most leftwing culture is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism the soviet union was quite fond of culture it just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of communist ideology the left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda \nits this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked when fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves first facts and then fact checks became meaningless unable to even recognize a fact media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity \nthe average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults \nat the washington post  michelle yee fact checks donald trumps comment that hillarys email scandal is bigger than watergate and concludes that since watergate led to nixons resignation and hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions it cant be bigger than watergate since the scandal has yet to be resolved a fact check of it could only take place in the future \ncnn featured toronto star fact checker daniel dale who claimed that trump said  lies in one day \nthe list of lies included deeming trumps statement that hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that hillary clinton had received debate questions some of these lies are themselves lies others like yee show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false \njust how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when hillary clinton pleaded at the debate please fact checkers get to work her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking that was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center \nnearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks but the biggest fact checking department of the media rather than by the media isnt in the united states but in germany in america fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless \nand those who do it often not only dont know the facts but dont even know what a fact is",

    "text": "go to article \nthe obama department of justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the democratic partys presidential nominee hillary clinton to escape legal accountability for her actions from attorney general loretta lynch on down through the justice departments political ranks the department has blocked the fbi from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion whether it is hillarys use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state or her involvement in the payforplay clinton enterprise known as the clinton foundation the obama administration is applying a banana republicstyle double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her \nlynch and president obama were reportedly furious with fbi director james comey for sending a letter to congress on october  th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the email case had come to light which required further investigation this evidence consisted of a batch of emails fbi investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to anthony weiner clinton confidante huma abedins estranged husband while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving weiners alleged sexting to an underage girl comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let hillary off the hook in the email case last july he was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from fbi agents who felt betrayed by that decision \ndepartment of justice officials had leaned on comey not to send the letter to congress claiming that it would violate department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election to his credit comey ignored the department officials objections claiming he had an obligation to keep the congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case \ndemocrats who had lavished praise on comey for his july decision lashed out at comey for sending his letter updating congress senate minority leader harry reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that comey may have violated the law by informing congress because reid argued he appeared to be taking sides in an election the disgraced former attorney general eric holder held in contempt of congress for withholding information relating to the fast and furious scandal said about comeys action i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is up to the director to correct his mistake  not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the american people \nsince when has holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the american people holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust with his blatant politicization of the obama department of justice as evidenced by the obama department of justices handling of the multiple fbi investigations involving hillary clinton the department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption it interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in hillarys favor ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed obama and preserve his legacy \nfirst the department of justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the email case or in connection with the fbis investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said  thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that \nkallstroms belief that lynch acted to influence the results of the fbi probes in hillarys favor is buttressed by lynchs  minute private tarmac meeting with bill clinton shortly before fbi director comey faced the cameras on july  th with his exculpatory announcement \nsecond at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the email case including to hillarys lawyer and confidante cheryl mills and to platte river networks paul combetta it appears that combetta had previously lied to government investigators  a crime in itself  while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently bleachbited emails to delete them even though they had been subject to a previously issued congressional subpoena the immunity agreements garnered nothing in return but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the fbis separate clinton foundation investigation apparently the department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant rather than granting useless immunities in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the email investigation that might have been contained in those devices \nthird the department and fbi did not conduct their last minute interview of hillary clinton under oath and allowed cheryl mills  herself a material witness  to sit in during hillarys interview they did not ask pertinent followup questions there was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of hillarys statements during the interview against her sworn congressional testimony or her many public statements \nfourth the department of justice reportedly refused to allow the fbi to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations in fact senior department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough fbi investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while hillary was secretary of state their true motivations and any favors extended by the state department in return \nfinally the crossconnections between the clintons and some high level department of justice and fbi officials cry out for recusal but not so in this administration for example the wife of the deputy fbi director who was involved in the laggard clinton foundation investigation andrew mccabe just happened to have received a large donation from close clinton ally virginia governor terry mcauliffe to her  run for the state senate \nto make matters worse the obama department of justice assigned assistant attorney general peter j kadzik a close friend of hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta to communicate with congress about what kadzik promised would be a thorough review of the newly discovered emails from anthony weiners online account \npodesta praised kadzik in an email to an obama campaign official back in  as a fantastic lawyer and said about his pal kept me out of jail their history together goes further back than that during the waning days of bill clintons presidency it was kadzik then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive marc rich who lobbied podesta then serving as bill clintons chief of staff for a presidential pardon on his clients behalf kadziks lobbying effort no doubt helped along by contributions to hillary clintons senate campaign and to bill clintons presidential library paid off bill clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office \nkadzik joined the department of justice in april  first as a deputy assistant attorney general for legislative affairs and then as the principal deputy with the podesta connection intact kadzik has served as a highly placed clinton campaign mole in the department an email dated may   from kadzik to podesta released by wikileaks  proves the point bearing the subject heading heads up kadzik advised podesta about upcoming congressional testimony by the head of the departments civil division and about another filing in the freedom of information case that would mean it will be awhile  before the state department posts the emails podesta forwarded kadziks heads up email to several senior hillary clinton campaign officials with the admonition additional chances for mischief \nexploiting his coordinating role in the reopened email investigation and contacts with fbi investigators kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal podesta and to provide inside information to the clinton campaigns supporters in congress as well \nthe clintons manage to turn virtually everything they touch into a cesspool of corruption the obama department of justice is no exception",

mentored media organ cubadebate oct   \nthere was a day when winning a ringing endorsement from communist massmurdering terror sponsors who craved and came within a whisker of nuking your nation would not be considered an asset for a us presidential candidate \n in any nation of the worldand even in the us during normal timesdonald trump would find himself either in prison or in a mental institution \nthere was a day when being threatened with prison and torture even figuratively by an enemy stalinist regime that jailed and tortured political prisoners many of them us citizens at a higher rate than stalin during the great terror would be considered an enormous asset for a us presidential candidate \nbut the ringing communist endorsement for hillary clinton gets even better \n hillary clinton is our only hope of detaining barbarism \nso warns the eunuch scribe for a totalitarian regime that murdered more cubans in its first three years in power than hitler murdered germans during his first six and in the process converted a highlycivilized immigrantswamped nation into a slumsewer with the hemispheres highest suicide rate which is ravaged by tropical diseases where tens of thousands have died trying to escape where alley cats constitute a delicacy and where oxcarts represent luxury transportation \non a few occasions trump has even suggested the assassination of hillary clinton \nso warn the notorious assassins of suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging from camilo cienfuegos to tony de la guardia to manuel barbarroja pineiro yes the castro regime devoured its own children even more voraciously than even lenin and stalins \nthe news are dominated by revelationssome on videoshowing trumps obscenity and male chauvinist conductalong with his treatment of women as sex objects \nso warns the stalinist regime that jailed and tortured  cuban women for political crimes a totalitarian horror utterly unknown in the western hemisphere until the castro brothers and che guevara took power some of these cuban ladies suffered twice as long in castros gulag as alexander solzhenitsyn suffered in stalins \ntheir prison conditions were described by former political prisoner maritza lugo the punishment cells measure  feet wide by  feet long the toilet consists of an  inch hole in the ground through which cockroaches and rats enter especially in cool temperatures the rat come inside to seek the warmth of our bodies and we were often bitten the suicide rate among women prisoners was very high \non christmas eve of  a cuban woman named juana diaz figueroa spat in the face of the executioners who were binding and gagging her castro and che guevaras kgbtrained secret police had found her guilty of feeding and hiding bandits cuban rednecks who took up arms to fight the stalinist theft of their land to build sovietstyle kolkhozes when the blast from castroite firing squad demolished her face and torso juana was six months pregnant \nthey started by beating us with twisted coils of electric cable recalls former cuba political prisoner ezperanza pena from exile today i remember teresita on the ground with all her lower ribs broken gladys had both her arms broken doris had her face cut up so badly from the beatings that when she tried to drink water would pour out of her lacerated cheeks \non mothers day they allowed family visits recalls manuela calvo from exile today but as our mothers and sons and daughters were watching we were beaten with rubber hoses and highpressure hoses were turned on us knocking all of us the ground floor and rolling us around as the guards laughed and our lovedones screamed helplessly \nwhen female guards couldnt handle us male guards were called in for more brutal beatings i saw teenaged girls beaten savagely their bones broken their mouths bleeding  recalls polita grau \nthousands upon thousands of cuban women have also drowned died of thirst or have been eaten alive by sharks attempting to flee the regime founded by the folks who recently endorsed hillary clinton this from a nation formerly richer than half the nations of europe and deluged by immigrants from same \nremember how donald trump was taken greatly to task by the media for not quickly repudiating david dukes socalled endorsement \nwell we certainly look for the media to take hillary clinton similarly to task for not instantly repudiating the endorsement of massjailing masstorturing massmurdering stalinists \nafter all recalling the sticks and stones can break my bones riddle of our childhood david

more popular than \n the bubonic plague \n obamacare \n osama bin ladens corpse \nits not much to go on but the atlantic decided to run a piece by chimamanda adichie titledwhy is hillary clinton so widely loved \nyour response to seeing the name chimamanda adichie was probably huh unless youre a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her chimamanda adichie is a nigerian novelist whose we should all be feminists is big in those circles \nthe clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned obama poetry and like most hillary branding it fails badly \nthere are howlers like there are millions who admire the tapestry of hillary clintons past and there are people who when hillary clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the united states will weep from joy its not quite a hymn to comrade stalin nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck \nand then theres the phrasing oh the phrasing hillary clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the american public as the first lady of arkansas \nthis is an awkward attempt to channel that obama poetry but instead it reads like a dvd manual badly translated from the japanese \nthe atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tineared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing \nshe was a lawyer full of dreams \nshe was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal order \nthen theres the theme of the article which is to just deny reality \na conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady and the label stuck because it was repeated over and overand it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a liar then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has reemerged during this election even though politifact a respected source of information about politicians has certified that she is more honest than most politicians \nthe perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after hillary clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in new york on  but dont worry hillary is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so \n other words have been repeated over and over with no context until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something terrible if only because of how often it is invoked \nhow about classified emails or illegal server or violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material thats got lots of context or coverup \nthe people who love hillary clinton know that the it system at the state department is old and stodgy nothing like a blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton was used to her blackberry and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state \npeople who love hillary know that she love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl politifact thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the iphone hillary has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system \nthe american conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of proportion soon followed almost bashfully by the rest of the american media \nis that how it works in nigeria because thats not how it works in america \nthere is no objective basis on which to equate hillary clinton to her opponent \ntheyre both mammals they need oxygen to live theyre better writers than chimamanda adichie \nthe people who love hillary clinton see the failings of the general american media where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone \nthey bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent hillary from being the thrumming first lady of north america \nthey know that she is a bit too careful but they understand that she has to be that she cannot afford spontaneity \nyou would think with all those six figure speeches she could afford a little \nher actions so falsely magnified that she leaned into caution wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted  \nand wrapped in her caution her whirling blackberry in one hand she bristled at the public retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past \nthere are millions of americans who do not have the selfindulgent expectation that a politician be perfect they are frustrated that hillary clinton is allowed no complexity  \nget beyonce on the phone i think adichie has got another hit",

with the fbi \nbut thats exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillarys opponent in this election \nthe fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillarys people have circulated a letter attacking comey there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump it wouldnt be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi \nthe fbis leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary and the fbis credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton \nthe covert struggle between fbi agents and obamas doj people has gone explosively public \nthe new york times has compared comey to j edgar hoover its bizarre headline james comey role recalls hoovers fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published a column calling for comeys resignation not to be outdone time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women \njames carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch \ncountless media stories charge comey with violating procedure do you know whats a procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server \nsenator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever \nif james comey is really out to hurt hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it \nnot too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiners computer \neither comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs \nthe only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a  unfavorable rating \nand its an interesting question \nhillarys old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that it was a security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi \npretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb \nthere are two possible explanations \nhillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign \nbut the other explanation is that her people panicked \ngoing to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign its an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi thats not hubris its fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her \nduring the original fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi \ntheres only one reason for such bizarre behavior \nthe clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival and so its gone all in on fighting the fbi its an unprecedented step born of fear its hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot \nclinton loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid \nyou can smell the fear \nthe fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation its finding new emails all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isnt how you react to smoke its how you respond to a fire \nthe misguided assault on the fbi tells us that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup was a preemptive cover up the clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed \nthe clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near it \nthe campaign against comey is pure intimidation its also a warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand \nhillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but shes never shown fear or desperation before now that has changed whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else has",

community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when obama leaves office during obamas tenure relations with israel were caustic at best barely five months after taking office he publicly launched a scathing attack against israel  where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between israeli and palestinian actions  and did so in one of the most virulently antisemitic countries on the planet he later skipped over israel despite the fact that israel was a mere minute plane ride away that was obamas opening salvo against americas closest ally it was only downhill from there \nobama utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about israel to sympathetic members of the press in one such instance an administration official probably ben rhodes  referred to prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a  chickensht  in another instance obama voiced concurrence with french president nicholas sarkozy when sarkozy characterized netanyahu as a  liar  \noften the obama administration would subject israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits israels defense minister moshe yaalon was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata in the most notorious incident obama left netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with michelle and his daughters one commentator dryly noted that obama treated netanyahu as though he was the president of equatorial guinea \nultimately obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from democratic lawmakers and donors obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against israel never dissipated and relations with israels prime minister remained toxic \ntensions surfaced again during israels counter insurgency campaign against the gazabased terror group hamas obama held up a shipment of hellfire missiles to israel and then tried to strongarm israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by turkey and qatar two despotic nations that support hamas and gave aid and comfort to islamic state terrorists \nobama saw netanyahus opposition to the jcpoa the socalled iran deal as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations the socalled settlements were another point of contention obama disregarded a letter of assurance to israel provided by the bush administration specifying that in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of  \nbush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of israel to build within those blocs it is also important to note that no new settlement was created during obamas term of office and netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories but nothing was ever enough for obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate israel at every turn his parting shot was at the united nations general assembly during a recent address to that contemptible body he explicitly singled out israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of indonesia obamas moral compass had gone completely awry \ndespite the fact that obama is in his twilight months he can still inflict immeasurable harm on israel according to a report featured in the wall street journal  obama is contemplating several options each with significant negative implications for israel the report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after november  so as not to harm clintons presidential prospects \nhe may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of israeli communities living in east jerusalem judea and samaria perhaps more ominously he may seek to impose dictates on israel utilizing the un security council \nin one such scenario obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring israeli communities situated in judea and samaria to be illegal alternatively the administration may seek formal recognition of the state of palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects israels existence as a jewish state lastly he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant israeli territorial concessions \nthe united states does not have to actively support any unsc resolution to see the successful passage of antiisraeli measures it merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers france facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized muslim population has historically been the fiercest advocate for the palestinian arabs it is likely that the administration would seek to have the french submit a draft resolution and the united states would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted thus guaranteeing passage \nisrael has few friends on the security council and american collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antisemitism would be an act of extreme betrayal it would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement \nbut israel is not without recourse there is strong bipartisan support for israel in congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the white house their strong opposition to un involvement \nsome like the jerusalem posts caroline glick have suggested that the israelis can reach out to the russians with carrots in an effort to counter obamas nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch moscow has always been in the pockets of the muslim bloc and its recent vote at unesco in support of a resolution denying the jewish nexus to jerusalem serves to reinforce this view moreover even if russia can be persuaded relying on putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the mafia and would come with a steep price \nit is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration  spiraling healthcare costs racial discord cyber breaches russias seizure of crimea and eastern ukraine isis the meltdown in the arab world iranian terrorism chinas expansion into the south and east china seas the migrant crisis immigration reform  obama would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the mideasts

three shifts for his designated successor former first lady and secretary of state hillary clinton as the fbi continues its investigations and clinton emails continue to emerge it is worth recalling the mysteries in the presidents narrative \nlast year obamas narrator as the new york times called david axelrod released his massive believer  my forty years in politics  the author recalls a perfectly timed and unexpected call that would change his life \ndavid its barack said the voice on the phone im thinking about what i want to do next and was wondering if we could talk this call took place in  which explains the perfect timing \non february   the presidents maternal grandfather stanley dunham passed away at  so gramps as the narrator called him was no longer around to offer insights on family history correct any accounts that might appear or write one of his own \nin the  dreams from my father gramps might say that a kenyan foreign student looks a lot like nat king cole actually gramps might not the kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance to cole who passed away in  but enjoyed a revival in the s through daughter natalies unforgettable album \nthe narrator of dreams from my father invokes a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny and he doesnt fault people their suspicions if they fail to take him at face value his elusive father is a prop in someone elses narrative and an image i could alter on a whim or ignore when convenient the narrative itself is a myth a tale and a useful fiction \ndreams from my father has no photo section no index and key characters get only a first name these include frank who gets  words back in  the president himself identified this person as frank marshall davis the stalinist paul kengor regards as the presidents mentor as he explained in the communist the untold story of frank marshall davis  \nin dreams from my real father  documentarian joel gilbert made a case that davis is the presidents biological father malik obama son of the kenyan barack h obama sees a strong physical resemblance  that also holds true on the policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities between the writings of davis and the policies of president barack obama \nthe kenyan barack obama though a man of the left was not a prosoviet communist had he been prosoviet he would have attended patrice lumumba university in moscow indeed obama warned his fellow kenyans about soviet meddling in africa \nthe kenyan obama would have found strange the presidents  cancelation of missile defense for european allies an outspoken man he would not have supported the kind of hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described in stonewalled my fight for truth against the forces of obstruction intimidation and harassment in obamas washington  \nthe kenyan barack h obama had issues with strongman types such as jomo kenyatta who ruled kenya from  until his death in  in keeping with his country and most of africa the kenyan barack obama is not on record as a supporter of homosexual causes frank marshall davis on the other hand was certainly on board as davis wrote in his  memoir livin the blues  \nduring the dramatic civil rights demonstrations of the s i often thought we ought to form a united front with joint sitins at cafes in my mind i envisioned the result an indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning the police get here in a hurry we got niggers at our counters and our washrooms are loaded with fairies and lesbians or perhaps there might have been a joint march on washington waving banners blacks and homos arise \nthat and davis pornographic novel sex rebel black  might explain the presidents stubborn desire to protect himself from scrutiny it could also have something do with what the narrator calls the less flattering aspects of my fathers character \nin dreams from my father  the kenyan is raised a muslim but in the audacity of hope he is a confirmed atheist thinking religion to be so much superstition like the mumbojumbo of witch doctors that he had witnessed in the kenyan villages of his youth \nin audacity  the narrator explains that he went to a predominantly muslim school in indonesia he does not indicate whether atheists lutherans jews or buddhists also attended the school registration records were supposedly destroyed by flooding \nthe predominantly muslim school also emerges in believer  but axelrod does not indicate if students of other faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham and even the kenyan barack obama are missing from this account but it proves enlightening in other ways \nin a  brian williams of msnbc asked presidential candidates what steps they would take in the event of a simultaneous terror attack on major american cities as axelrod explains obama neglected to include that he would pursue the perpetrators \nhillary clinton did likewise in  passing off what she privately regarded as a terrorist attack on the us compound in benghazi as a spontaneous protest over a video like the president clinton has always shown a stubborn desire to protect herself from scrutiny with bleachbit  hammers and lies hillary and her handlers did their best to make more than  emails disappear \nthe contents remain something of a mystery just as mysteries linger about the president and his background on the other hand by now some things are perfectly clear \nthe potus and former flotus both decline to identify islamic terrorism both are shrinkwrapped in statist superstition and both lie with the greatest of ease on these counts like the critters in orwells animal farm one can find it impossible to say which was which \nback in july the party faithful were chanting four more years during the presidents speech at the democratic national convention",

    "text": "the unraveling of hillarys corrupt sphere of influence november   michael cutler \nthe  elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director james comey on friday october   as reported by nbc news on october  th   fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in clinton probe  as reid accuses comey of hatch act violation  once again the clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional indeed tom clancy could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues \nwhile comeys recent remarks regarding the clinton investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how hillarys use of a private computer server private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception \nthe current focus of the clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information if that laptop had been hacked both weiner and abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail this was an issue raised by congressman louie gohmert texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october   in a segment that was posted under the title  rep gohmert clinton is a potential victim of blackmail  \nadditional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well a chain is as strong as its weakest link the weak links begin with hillary clinton and huma abedin and may now include anthony weiner and perhaps others meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that wikileaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the clintons or their foundation \ncould not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well \nlets take a moment to understand how all of this began \njust months earlier hillary clinton had been let off the hook by an fbi director who in his official statement on july    included this excerpt to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but that is not what we are deciding now \nby comeys own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why comey did not see fit to take comparable action with ms clinton \ncomeys ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security \nhowever perhaps comeys hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference on june   abc news reported  us attorney general loretta lynch bill clinton meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report  \nthat article served as a predication for my article  loretta lynchs private meeting with bill clinton prior to release of benghazi report  why would the attorney general who sets the tone for law enforcement do this \nas attorney general lynch is fbi director comeys boss \nat the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating hillarys illegal use of a private email server nonsecure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the clinton foundation \nin fact on october   breitbart reported  clinton foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director  therefore bill clinton was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren \nhowever just days after that meeting news organizations reported that hillary was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election \non july   newsmax reported  ny times clinton weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins  hillarys statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to go along to get along \nindeed lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary  loretta lynch same as the old boss  the attorney general nominees disturbing views on us immigration law \nmy article included an excerpt from a yahooap news report attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us pressed by sen jeff sessions of alabama a leading immigration hardliner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned however when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job lynch replied the right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response under later questioning by democratic sen chuck schumer of new york lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status \nthis was disturbing and telling clearly ms lynchs views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals \nas attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department ms lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective \nhowever lynch and the others who have fallen under hillary clintons corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in hillarys web of deception having fallen victim to the hillary virus throughout clintons many decades in american politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable it is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election",

early s tim kaine took a year off from his legal studies in order to work with jesuit missionaries in honduras during the nine months he spent there kaine developed a keen interest in the teachings of local priests who were adherents of liberation theology  which is essentially marxism dressed up as christianity kaine himself embraced liberation theology and later claimed that it had changed him and deepened him after completing his legal education kaine joined a civil litigation firm and practiced law for  years he also launched a career in local politics in the mids and eventually went on to serve as governor of virginia  and as a us senator present this past july hillary clinton named kaine as her vice presidential running mate \nover the course of his political career kaine has developed some noteworthy ties to a number of islamist individuals and organizations in his role as virginias governor in  kaine appointed esam omeish president of the muslim brotherhood affiliated muslim american society mas to virginias immigration commission omeish had previously served as president of the national muslim students association and as a board member of the islamic society of north america  both of which have deep ties to the brotherhood omeish had also been a board chairman of the islamic center of passaic county  a new jersey mosque with significant terrorist connections and he had been a vice president and board member of the dar alhijrah islamic center  a virginia mosque whose imams have included among others an alqaeda operative and a supporter of suicide bombings prior to his appointment by kaine omeish had described the muslim brotherhood as a moderate organization he had praised the former hamas leader ahmed yassin as our beloved sheikh and he had pledged to lend his assistance to those palestinians who understood that the jihad way is the way to liberate your land in may  kaine was the keynote speaker at the muslim american society freedom foundations standing for justice dinner in  kaine agreed to attend the dar alhijrah islamic centers annual fundraising banquet in september  kaine spoke at an event that presented a lifetime achievement award to us muslim brotherhood leader jamal barzinji  who was closely associated with the palestinian islamic jihad  hamas and the extremist international institute of islamic thought iiit in  kaines us senate

objected strenuously when republican house speaker john boehner invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to speak to the us congress about the gravity of the growing iranian nuclear threat and his netanyahus  profound disagreement  with the negotiated deal that the obama administration was pursuing with iran kaine joined seven other senate democrats in boycotting netanyahus speech that summer kaine declared himself a  strong supporter  of the final agreement which allowed the islamist regime in tehran to enrich uranium build advanced centrifuges purchase ballistic missiles fund terrorism and be guaranteed of having a nearzero breakout time to the development of a nuclear bomb approximately a decade down the road in may  kaine was one of fourteen us senators who wrote a letter to president barack obama urging him to allow  people from wartorn terrorismravaged syria into the united states as refugees despite many peoples concern that terrorists could potentially infiltrate the refugee program later that same year kaine opposed a bill passed by the house of representatives that would have required more careful vetting of syrians and iraqis before they could be admitted to the united states as refugees these refugees are people who are terrorized not terrorists kaine said in a november  interview wherein he claimed that the refugee vetting process is one of the safest areas that we have in a speech on the senate floor the following month kaine said i look at this refugee crisis as a test  about whether we like the biblical job will be true to our principles or whether well abandon them he also urged his fellow legislators to emulate the example of the thcentury indians down near jamestown island who had helped starving english settlers to survive by offering an extension of a hand to strangers in a strange land kaine ranks among the most leftwing political figures in the united states today he is the only person with a  lifetime rating from the american conservative union which has graded members of congress on their voting records each year since  similarly conservativereviewcom gives kaine a  rating in short tim kaine is

    "text": "posted by madeline  oct      daily blog    thanks gre\nbovendien \nformer defense minister of canada paul hellyer has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement with this convention which comes out of the hat of the international bankers  families will obtain control over almost the entire world constitutions of member countries will no longer apply only the will of the  families the elite will apply \nthe lawsuit was officially filed on october  of this year and actually consists of four \nnamely separate indictments the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament \nthe federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels  the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forumprotected by the division of powers under the constitution act  \nmost of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law  the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes and \nceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms  and overrides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health education social services and public utilitiesincluding the elimination of subsidies monopolies and state enterprises for public welfare in short the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens \nvarious provisions of ceta violated constitutional builtrights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health education social services and public funds including the termination of subsidies  monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest in short the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants \nbut this is not all paul hellyer which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world the international bankers international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only  families \npaul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers yet not so long ago until  the canadian government expressed its money itself there was no such thing as inflation poverty and debt canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time life was good cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do from one day to the issued money creation in  the central banks and money was no longer free within a few years canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education health housing etc can be paid without causing debts paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version he lets no grass grow does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat \nnow the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this \ndear readers this could be the big break this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers the same applies we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it we want a better and fairer world then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for \nprivatized money is the reason for all wars privatized money is the cause of poverty oppression exploitation neglect of our elderly and less fortunate privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet now is the chance to get out from under the yoke to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over  years with one goal to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer \nthe earth is not a handful of bankers and politicians the earth belongs to everyone",

    "text": "our new country women and minorities hit hardest the rape culture the media wont cover october   ann coulter every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the democrats coincidentally the democrats have brought in another  to  million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole  our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july    two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online uk july   needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal alien gang rape at all by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape  why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam  reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe thats hillarys dream if she wins joe sobrans parody of the typical new york times headline about anything will come true women and minorities hit hardest",

couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc \nand band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements \nband mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned  in speaking fees \nof course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus \nwe have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation \nbands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments \nband wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place \nband also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote \nband was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them \nbanks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part \nband described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year \nteneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary

    "text": "reprinted from spectatororg  \ntom hayden the vietnam war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age  \nhaydens journey was in many ways tragic born december  in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents were irish catholics who named him after st thomas aquinas and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly haydens friend and exradical david horowitz observed that hayden harbored what irving howe once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote horowitz who seemed in perpetual search of enemies \nhayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that thomas aquinas would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society \nhayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi jane fonda and literally wrote the script for sds hayden wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which haydens creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade \nright \nhaydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june   letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who were killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that haydens sweetheart jane posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by tom hayden at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice \nbut not etched in our memory was what might have been tom haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for obama \nthe groups members came together in  coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the s sds crowd among the nearly  formal signers to progressives for obama were mark rudd carl davidson jane fonda thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in  then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications \nwhereas the likes of obama friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in  by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for obama flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right \nappropriately spearheading progressives for obama was the man who had spearheaded sds tom hayden was one of the four initiators of progressives for obama along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover \nit is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for obama resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december  for their subversive activities aside from the likes of hayden rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for obama were bob pardun who was sds education secretary from  and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds \namong these names from the insane s all were fired up in  over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack obama offered they saw obama as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november   obama won the day and they at last won the day too \nand therein among the progressives for obama the testimony of leader tom hayden was especially revealing \nunderstand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system hayden went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at obamas alma mater occidental college \nlike mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by  he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party \nof course hayden once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in  no matter the party of  was different and warmly accepted him \nhayden was ecstatic over barack obamas presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for obama \nduring the  campaign a touched hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of obama in one article titled obama and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community hayden mused \ni didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in  the buds of curiosity quickened \nhayden saw in obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as obama himself had once put it hayden wished that win or lose the obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform obama as well both could reinforce and shape one another \nhayden wrote that in june  when obama was elected later the following november hayden was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that tom hayden saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in  at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by  the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the s kiddies \nthe former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for obama once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who were prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured hayden could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for obama he began regularly sounding off against obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer \nwith the presidency won hayden and his allies were free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president obamas desire for reform and mandate for change \nin the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under obama hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams \nby this election cycle in  tom hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party \nalas it was fitting that tom hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured \ntoday at long last for tom hayden and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished",

    "text": "realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer \nin an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed \non tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america \nthis kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism \nand so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  \ngaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas \nguandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence \npredictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community \nthe world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates \nbut the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection \njohn bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever \nthe media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is   \njohn bennett has yet again stuck his neck out for freedom in these hard times those who are willing to do that have to hang together",
