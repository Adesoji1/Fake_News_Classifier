Fed Up,2016-11-04T19:40:00.000+02:00,breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information  percentfedupcom,"breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information blackwater usa founder retired navy seal erik prince 
prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week 
because of weinergate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing prince claimed 
they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than  times hillary clinton went there at least six times he said 
the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained 
i believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters prince said 
theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe  prince declared 
marlow asked prince to clarify these revelations 
nypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found 
so nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt prince contended 
there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated 
so the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue prince said 
he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges 
the prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing 
marlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons 
prince agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials 
listen to interview here 
the point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well prince said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on and is slowly being exposed 
the justice department is trying to run out the clock to elect hillary clinton to prevent any real justice from being done he warned 
as for the mayor of new york city prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this 
the evidence is so bad the email content is so bad that i think even he wants to stay away from it which is really telling he said

EdJenner,2016-11-10T02:37:06.677+02:00,not kidding colleges give students safe spaces to cry over trump winthreaten students over protrump chalkings,"email for republican politicians like ohio governor john kasich who refused to get behind donald j trumpit turns out trump was righthe didnt need you in spite of the massive media force who came out against him and the never trumpers from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him if obama was running against donald j trump today trump would have beaten him 
its easy to glance at tuesdays popular vote  which with  percent of all precincts reporting shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in   and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base but the truth is much more complicated while she underperformed relative to obamas  totals in several midwestern states  ohio michigan iowa and wisconsin  clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania north carolina virginia nevada and new hampshire whats more she far surpassed obamas  vote total in florida the countrys biggest swing state yet somehow while obama carried florida clinton lost it which brings us to an important question was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday or does he deserve far more credit could he for instance have competed with the vaunted obama machine the answer somewhat shockingly is yes 
a review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump  would have defeated obama  in the electoral college disclaimer this obviously is an applestooranges exercise because no two elections are the same nor are any two electorates still unlike debating whether the  cubs would defeat the  yankees this is not an entirely abstract argument a comparison of their respective performances in the countrys most competitive states shows trump edging obama in a hypothetical headtohead matchup the math might seem impossible after all obama won nearly  million votes in  trump is currently at  million and should finish around  million which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won how then could trump have topped obama in the electoral college the answer republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nations most critical battleground states lets look at them individually in descending order by population and do the electoralvote math the  totals arent yet final because not all precincts have reported

robert de niro gave antidonald trump protesters across the united states his backing friday as he spoke about how depressed the tycoons win in the presidential election had made him 
the yearold star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film the comedian in los angeles when he was asked how he was coping with trumps victory over democratic rival hillary clinton 
how am i doing im very depressed the famously laconic raging bull actor told reporters 
we have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government 
asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of tuesdays election he replied yes absolutely things arent being done right 
demonstrators took to the streets in miami los angeles new york and other us cities for a third straight night on friday 
in manhattan they held signs reading your wall cant stand in our way  a reference to the antiimmigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the us border with mexico 
de niro hasnt minced his words in his criticism of trump describing him as a punk a pig and an idiot 
id like to punch him in the face he said before the election 
earlier in the day a town in southern italy where de niros grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape 
if after the disappointment of trump he wants to take refuge here we are ready to welcome him said antonio cerio the mayor of ferrazzano

okay lets address this hillary might win the popular vote isnt that electoral college situation just awful thing head on 
no its not awful its great and it protects the importance of your vote its also uniquely american and demonstrates yet again the onceincreation brilliance of the founding fathers 
first of all shes probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast she may win the number of votes counted but not the votes cast 
states dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference if there is a margin of  votes counted and there are  absentee ballots outstanding then the state tabulates those if the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results then the absentee ballots arent counted 
who votes by absentee ballot students overseas the military businesspeople on trips etc the historical breakout for absentee ballots is about  republican in  when al gore won the popular vote nationally by  votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder there were  million absentee ballots in california alone a  breakout of those yields a  to million republican vote advantage so bush would have gotten a vote margin from californias uncounted absentee ballots alone so much for gores  popular vote victory that was the headline on the ny times and it was the lead story on nbc nightly news right no youre kidding 
getting back to the win the popular votelose the electoral college scenario thank gd we have that or else california and ny would determine every election every time 
but the electoral college brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say as do madison ave execs and factory workers in tennessee

political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j trump and his tough immigration policies maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence there will never be a president trump 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of presidentelect trumps proposals would be violations of international law 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday the international human rights lawyer and wife of george clooney said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the us or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that 
the yearold wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to are these things actually going to happen or is the us going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally according to the hollywood reporter 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george a staunch hillary clinton supporter have spoken out against trump in the past 
earlier this year amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press

they had to know they had it coming 
donald trump scolded media big shots during an offtherecord trump tower sitdown on monday sources told the post 
it was like a fing firing squad one source said of the encounter 
trump started with cnn chief jeff zucker and said i hate your network everyone at cnn is a liar and you should be ashamed  the source said 
the meeting was a total disaster the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration but instead they got a trumpstyle dressing down the source added 
a second source confirmed the fireworks 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about  or  people including the big news anchors from all the networks the other source said 
trump kept saying were in a room of liars the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest deceitful liars he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar and cnn was a network of liars the source said 
trump didnt say nbc reporter katy tur by name but talked about an nbc female correspondent who got it wrong then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was martha raddatz who was also in the room 
the stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a trump administration 
cbs good morning cohost gayle king did not stand up but asked some question how do you propose we the media work with you chuck todd asked some pretty pointed questions david muir asked how are you going to cope living in dc while your family is in nyc it was a horrible meeting 
heres a sampling of trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before he won the election in a landslide in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down 
trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway told reporters the gathering went well 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks she said during a gaggle in the lobby of trump tower pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days 
the meeting was off the record meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations 
the hourlong session included top execs from network and cable news channels among the attendees were nbcs deborah turness lester holt and chuck todd abcs james goldston george stephanopoulos david muir and martha raddatz

donald trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood 
theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of hillary clinton and trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places 
in texas last week a trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of trumps stupid hats and a deplorables tshirt to vote 
election code prohibits any person from electioneering within  feet of a polling place 
of course trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them 
well now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down 
at collin college in plano texas a trump sign was discovered ziptied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places 
but when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside the blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal 
it just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other local democratic party campaign chair steve spainhouer said in response  i think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful 
heres the video via ktvt  
frankly this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as election day approaches and if trump loses his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup 
clearly these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger but you wont hear donald trump condemning this act of violence after all he is the one inciting it

new video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father fred trump young donald trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants 
as part of an investigation by nbc news stanley leibowitz who worked as a rental agent for the trump organization told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties 
in the interview leibowitz said that trump told him i dont rent to the nword and indicates that trump made this statement with donald trump in the room and that the younger trump affirmed the policy 
the revelation comes at the same time that the clinton campaign has released a video highlighting trumps runin with the federal government over discrimination 
undercover investigators were sent to trump properties and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing the white applicants were allowed into the trump properties 
one bit of testimony determined that trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a c on the documents for colored and that was a sign that they should be denied 
the trumps denied the allegation but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing 
donald trumps involvement with his fathers business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media as is his fathers  million dollars that he gave to trump to start his business but if you accept that the trump organizations history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story and no matter how trump may try to wave it away  its still there

weve all seen pictures of the trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor complete with their young son barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents its a life most of us can never imagine while were paying our monthly bills so whats it like growing up with donald trump as a father according to scott melker a former classmate of donald trump jrs at the university of pennsylvania being the former reality show stars son wasnt what one might imagine or given trumps temperament it might be exactly what youd imagine 
on facebook  mekler told of the animosity trumps son had for this father 
i was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends next door to donald jrs room i walked out of the room to find donald trump at his sons door there to pick him up for a baseball game he recalls there were quite a few students standing around watching trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate don jr opened the door wearing a yankee jersey 
then mekler told of the moment trump slapped his son in the face in front of others 
without saying a word his father slapped him across the face knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates he simply said put on a suit and meet me outside and closed the door melker wrote 
donald jr was a drunk in college every memory i have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking he continued he absolutely despised his father and hated the attention that his last name afforded him his nickname was diaper don because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other peoples beds and urinate i always felt terrible for him he continued 
mekler said part of his reason for voting for hillary clinton is because in light of what i saw that day it is clear to me that donald trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country 
to be clear we are not demonizing trumps son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days whether melkers story is accurate or not were not sure but given trumps awful temper its difficult to discount it

gop presidential nominee donald trump has taken a ridiculously hardline  and even bigoted  stance on immigration he has promised to build a wall and force mexico to pay for it and he has said that he will erect deportation forces to root out and get rid of all people in the united states without proper documentation well as we already knew it turns out that the donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one 
according to the associated press  it turns out that donald trumps wife melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the united states when she first arrived from her native slovenia melania often modeled using just her first name and was first granted entry into the country on a visitors visa known as a bb visa this occurred on august   melania did not get a legal work visa until october   during the time when she was prohibited from working in the country melania made money on ten different modeling assignments totaling upwards of  she got a green card in  and became a naturalized citizen in  
so in other words melania trump lied about her immigration story as recently as thursday when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go and that this is how she did it melania said in part in her stump speech 
as a young entrepreneur i wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance so of course i came here living and working in america was a true blessing but i wanted something more i wanted to be an american 
well it appears that as has long been suspected that melania trump wasnt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims the information obtained by the ap include but are not limited to her contract from metropolitan international management  a modeling agency also theres the ledgers from the agency which is no longer in business that shows melania working during the time when she had the visitors visa but no work visa it seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up melanias wrongdoing but it is certainly quite interesting this would be why melania trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the united states and her eventual path to citizenship while it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud you can read more here at the associated press  
the long and short of it is this donald trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the other namely immigrants that is the height of hypocrisy seeing as how his own wife didnt completely comply with immigration law hopefully this story and the many other lies and coverups and shady dealings surrounding the trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time

if you had wanted to give trump supporters the benefit of the doubt this most recent incident proves that its far too much to give them 
a yearold man in allen park michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought theyd damaged the donald trump sign on his lawn yes this is the kind of deranged emotionally unstable supporters trump has attracted 
the man michael robert kubek had called police on october th to report that his trump sign had been hit by teenagers who had fled the scene when the police arrived at the scene they didnt find kubek at his home  however when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner there he was 
the police saw kubek standing over six children ages  who were sitting on the grass kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it the children denied any involvement and the officers told kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children 
according to the kids they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them instructing them to sit down on the grass those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock twitter twitter 
the newsherald reported 
the officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign but kubek repeated that he could not the officer then asked kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids according to police kubek said yes 
in response to another question from the officer kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered 
yes a grown man used a gun because he felt outnumbered by a small group of innocent kids this is exactly the type of unhinged person who shouldnt be trusted with firearms kubeks hearing is scheduled for december th  lets hope that whatever happens to kubek that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner you can watch a report below

trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnt hard getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is same thing with bullying but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted and to whom now the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trumps lies for just six weeks and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies which you can find here  
there are literally hundreds of lies in trumps speeches theyre not all  unique but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone including his enemies while keeping his supporters happy 
is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much tons of people claim hillary is a master liar but first shes actually more honest than most politicians second even if she could be considered anything like a master liar she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way shape or form 
the star put the lies into a whopping  categories clintons policies wtf daeshmiddle east clintons record african americansinner cities the clintons corruption rigged election tradeeconomy health care trumps endorsements refugeesimmigration polls obamas record the campaign russia trumps record taxes sex assault allegations clintons health and government corruption 
they also compiled a list of the top  types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis beginning with the electoral system is rigged of course its rigged against him 
after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election rigged became his catchword 
he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia chicago and st louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats 
in greeley colo trump told his supporters if they dont trust mailin ballots they should vote again in person so one did trump supporter terri lynn rote a yearold from iowa was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice 
nobodys committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans 
another is muslims are risky this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria who could be the great trojan horse of our time 
his claims that syrian refugees   per cent are muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children and their numbers is nowhere near trumps claims  about  have been admitted to the united states in  
the polls favour trump har de har har  trump only looks at the polls he likes and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls very few of the established scientific polls favor him nevertheless 
it seems clear trump manipulates exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is this poll denialism gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data suggests cnn 
his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself if supporters feel trump should be doing better then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible 
on oct  he said i won the last two debates and every poll showed it in fact every scientific poll showed that he lost 
of course when unscientific online polls came out in his favour trump was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers 
but these are just a few of his biggest most repeated lies he has also falsely said on twitter the failing nytimes reporters dont even call us anymore they just write whatever they want to write making up sources along the way falsely said by open borders hillary means totally unlimited immigration falsely said hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east falsely called nbc anchor lester holt the moderator of the first debate a democrat falsely said wow just came out on secret tape that crooked hillary wants to take in as many syrians as possible falsely said the us provided iran  billion as part of the nuclear deal falsely said in san bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed  and wounded many many peoplemuslims have to report the problems when they see them falsely asserted that clinton has been fighting isis her entire adult life falsely said all together the hillary clinton plan would bring in  refugees in her first term falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring nato obsolete because it doesnt cover terror falsely suggested nato created an antiterror position because of his comments falsely claimed clinton didnt release cholesterol or ekg information falsely said sexual assault allegations against him have been largely debunked falsely said apparently of sexual assault accuser summer zervos the one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense falsely said i did not i did not to clintons charge that he thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese falsely said i was against going into iraq and its so welldocumented falsely said our taxes are so high just about the highest in the world 
and so many more just in the last six weeks yes many of them are repeats but lies are lies if trump sees this hell likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the papers lying and continue to sell the myth that hes not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies

it began as it normally does with alec baldwins masterful donald trump character and kate mckinnons excellent portrayal of hillary clinton if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine 
i never use emails trump says in the cold opener i use a very private very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it its called twitter 
after he is informed that everyone can see his tweets trump replies 
really and im still in this thing america you must really hate this lady 
after a scathing rebuke of the medias decision to ignore trumps cozy relationship with putin the kkk and the fbi and instead focus on something as meaningless as hillary clintons emails something magical happened mckinnon and baldwin dropped the facade and got serious 
im sorry kate i just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this baldwin says i just feel gross all the time about this dont you all feel gross he added addressing the audience 
mckinnon agrees and the two embark on a friendship montage through the city before returning to the stage then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year none of this would have mattered if you dont vote baldwin says

as if the election of donald trump couldnt get even more disastrous and hypocritical senator lindsey graham just called on trump to nominate a rightwing extremist to nations highest court 
all year long republicans have been blocking president obamas nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court because they want the next president to make the pick and because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist 
south carolina senator lindsey graham told wyfftv that trump should pick texas senator ted cruz as the nominee and warned democrats not to block him which is hypocritical considering how republicans have treated president obamas nominee and threatened to block any nominees hillary clinton would have made had she won the election 
im here to tell my democratic colleagues that i voted for obamas nominees i expect them to give trumps nominees a fair shake he won this election he will pick a conservative i would put ted cruz on that list if they try to block this pick they will regret it if you dont honor trumps nominee youre making a huge mistake 
democrats should stand up and give graham a collective middle finger 
since antonin scalia died in february there has been a vacancy on the supreme court bench that has yet to be filled the body wasnt even cold yet before republicans vowed to block any nominee president obama picked to replace him going so far as to even deny garland a confirmation hearing thats far from the fair shake graham is asking democrats to give to a man as dangerous as ted cruz 
putting cruz on the supreme court would guarantee rulings against womens rights and lgbt rights as well as putting laws like the voting rights act and the civil rights act in further peril in no uncertain terms should democrats grant cruz a hearing nor should they respect any of trumps conservative choices for the court republicans should have thought about fair shakes before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the supreme court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than trump again senate republicans didnt even give garland a hearing or a vote they refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards president obama and so thats exactly what democrats should do to trump turnabout is fair play and republicans only have themselves to blame

i could have spent eight years doing anything  and at some level it would have been fine obama told the magazine  i could have focused on flowers i could have focused on decor i could have focused on entertainment because any first lady rightfully gets to define her role theres no legislative authority youre not elected and thats a wonderful gift of freedom 
in exercising her freedom michelle obama has done quite a bit to push education healthy eating and support for our veterans  and in exercising their freedom the right has responded with nothing but hate the reaction to the first lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical readers of yahoo news showered obama with racist remarks calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes 
if you thought this behavior would stop after the election you were wrong trump fans are not done by a long shot  and now they have been emboldened by america electing its first official kkk candidate

as predicted donald trumps victory on election day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities 
and its even happening in the deep blue state of california where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of pittsburg and snapped a photo of it 
twitter user james thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him this picture was taken in pittsburgh california my sister texted this to me  minutes agoour democracy is being tested even in california pictwittercomgdlkwlox 
 james thompson jetballin november   
the sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent africanamericans from getting equal rights 
you can hang a nr from a tree  equal rights he will never see it says 
the fbi has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it 
in the wake of trumps surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country in fact there have been  reports of people being bullied by trump supporters since the election night results 
these incidents include the harassment of a muslim teacher by a student in georgia and students designating water fountains white or colored at a florida high school 
frankly there are so many incidents that its difficult to list them all you can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here  
this is what trumps america looks like and its scary and this has all happend in the course of a few days as melania trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying what exactly does she mean by that is she going to call out all bullying including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husbands own supporters or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband because right now she isnt even first lady yet and her effort has failed miserably and she only has her husband to blame",english,addictinginfo.org,http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-501528656.jpg,bias,lindsey graham wants trump put ted cruz supreme court bench,november pm predicted donald trumps victory election day emboldened racist conservatives start harassing attacking minorities even happening deep blue state california woman spotted sign hanging side building town pittsburg snapped photo twitter user james thompson posted image sign social media platform sister sent picture taken pittsburgh california sister texted minutes agoour democracy tested even california pictwittercomgdlkwlox james thompson jetballin november sign clearly promotes lynching prevent africanamericans getting equal rights hang nr tree equal rights never see says fbi notified local police filed lawsuit effort force owners sign remove wake trumps surprising depressing victory rise number racist incidents country fact reports people bullied trump supporters since election night results incidents include harassment muslim teacher student georgia students designating water fountains white colored florida high school frankly many incidents difficult list find somewhat comprehensive tally trumps america looks like scary happend course days melania trump continues tell media focus ending bullying exactly mean going call bullying including racist bullying perpetrated husbands supporters going ignore incidents merely whine people criticize husband right isnt even first lady yet effort failed miserably husband blame,1,Real

post election the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history they are making the claim that trump wasnt elected because of racism he was elected because of the economy the problem with that argument though is that its simply not true trump voters are racist and theres proof 
the american national elections study anes began the study in january initially they asked how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead now of course anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that its very unlikely that whites arent getting jobs because minorities are but thats not what trump voters think the vast majority said that its extremely likely that minorities are taking jobs from white people graph courtesy of anes and salon  
then they asked the same trump voters about a nonracial issue trade despite the fact that trade was one of trumps signature issues their opinions on trade were mixed 
post election this is what the study found 
the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton eightyfour percent of whites who believe it is extremely likely that whites cant find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump compared with  percent of those who think it is not at all likely among white democrats  percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton compared with less than  percent of those who believe it is not at all likely eightyone percent of white women who think it is extremely likely people of color are taking jobs supported trump compared with  percent who dont think that 
more than that  percent of white trump supporters say black people are violent  percent think that of muslims 
unfortunately democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism hoping that eventually the aging bigots will die off it turns out their children are just as bad sean mcelwee the man who was responsible for publishing the study suggested this 
democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic racial and gender justice together a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic racial and gender inequality as ive shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel racism often diminishes support for progressive policies the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation 
great idea if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots claims go unchallenged

before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women by the pussy to billy bush it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trumps glaring faults as a presidential candidate during the primaries  for example he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors it turns out there might be a reason for that  trump was bribing the media  at least thats the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news 
in her memoire settle for more which will be released this week kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question in which she asked about the fact that he has called women fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades these are only a portion 
the worst and most controversial of which was this 
as the election progressed it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior he expected no demanded that the media kiss his orange ass if they didnt he would cut off access but before that he tried bribery 
while kelly couldnt speak for other members of the media she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels with full perks while the attempt clearly didnt work on kelly she says that with some their loyalty came cheap or perhaps not so cheap 
this is actually one of the untold stories of the  campaign i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage kelly said he also attempted to woo them with praise she said adding this is smart because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking 
trump tried to work the refs and some of the refs responded she said 
when it became obvious that some reporters were in the tank for trump she alleges in one chapter certain tv hosts would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased she didnt identify them by name or media outlet 
source yahoo 
kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trumps treatment of women the candidate called fox news exec bill sammon who told him about the first question all we heard about though during the election was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering the insider knowledge said that a woman in the flint michigan debate would ask a question about the flint water  
while bribing journalists isnt illegal per say it is highly unethical without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics democracy is impossible

its a common stereotype that food stamp recipients and those who abuse it are black hispanic or any other race but white according to the usda in their report for fiscal year   of recipients are white and  are black courtesy of travissonnocom 
while the media and americas culture will have you believe that black people or anyone who isnt white account for copious amounts of fraud theres a story breaking that you wont hear on fox news anytime soon or you might because any chance to crush the snap program they will take 
according to wcax news in new york 
more than  people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the north country 
investigators say over the past couple months people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the old time butcher block store in brushton 
police also say its not the first time the owner of that store dennis sauve has been charged with allowing such fraud 
police say more arrests are expected 
now heres the kicker theyre all white brushton new york where this bust happened has a population of roughly  people approximately  of the population is white and  are black these demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country  owsley country kentucky which is  white and  republican maybe we should investigate them 
i just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in brushton 
according to wptz news 
police say the arrests are the result of a yearlong investigation initiated by the franklin county department of social services fraud unit franklin county district attorneys office the united states department of agriculture and the new york state office of temporary and disability assistance helped with the investigation 
the store owner denis sauve also white has been charged with thirddegree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps 
this really isnt a racial issue so much as it is an i told you so issue while the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the lazy blacks who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance well here we are a major food stamp bust and every criminal involved is white

here is the simpsons new opening with bart simpson writing on the chalkboard being right sucks the simpsons updates its  prediction of a trump presidency thesimpsons pictwittercommyfrybdj

hopefully the financial despair the fictional president trump never becomes a reality but seeing as he has no experience is a businessman whos not as good as he says he is and the simpsons have been right thus far the futures looking pretty bleak 
heres the original clip of president lisa simpson calling out a donald trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy 
early on into trumps campaign the simpsons satirized the reality tv host turned presidentelect by having homer simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into trumps hair if we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality 
now we have to reap what weve sown or rather what the less than half of voting americans have sown considering trump only won with the electoral college and lost the popular vote to hillary clinton in his own words big league 
most of us with the simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well

it was just a few days ago that bernie sanders responded to trumps election win with the perfect message from democrats he said  
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare 
and from what was just announced it seems that sanders has every intention of making good on that warning earlier today the vermont senator was named chair of outreach during a closeddoor senate democrat caucus meeting according to the hill  in his new role sanders will lead outreach to bluecollar voters  the very voters who became trump supporters this year sanders will also be the ranking member on the senate budget committee acknowledging that he has a heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the united states government sanders said im going to do everything that i can to make sure that the budget that leaves the united states congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires with the announcement of sanders new position trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck hes spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class and now sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years by elevating sanders to this new role democrats are moving to a more grassroots message fully aware that sanders presidential campaign and vision for america resonated with many voters as we saw with sanders popularity in the primaries the vermont senator struck a nerve with workers and families making him the perfect candidate to go up against trump as he takes office sen debbie stabenow dmich commented on sanders new responsibility we want to expand on that and he will be reaching out to all our allies we have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset trump as hes been one of the most outspoken politicians on twitter since trumps win twitter twitter twitter

donald trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign and hes only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the presidentelect 
on monday trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access this meeting was particularly important because trump has previously limited press access and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected 
some reporters in attendance were nbcs deborah turness lester holt and chuck todd abcs james goldston george stephanopoulos david muir and martha raddatz cbs norah odonnell and charlie rose fox news bill shine jack abernethy jay wallace suzanne scott msnbcs phil griffin and cnns jeff zucker and erin burnett it was a good group and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan 
unfortunately instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward what the press got was a baby trump temper tantrum of epic proportions or as one person put it  it was like a fcking firing squad 
trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media according to the new york post  one anonymous source said 
the meeting was a total disaster the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration but instead they got a trumpstyle dressing down 
this claim was backed up by another person who said 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about  or  people including the big news anchors from all the networks 
trump kept saying were in a room of liars the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest deceitful liars he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar and cnn was network of liars 
this attack left reporters stunned and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic trump barely let them speak while this is certainly shocking this behavior is completely typical of trump he has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings 
americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is twitter twitter twitter 
interestingly enough trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well she said 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days 
disgraceful

remington researchs summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become increasingly competitive 
last week we found a presidential race where hillary clinton held a clear advantage this week we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go trump appears to be holding strong in his mustwin states and colorado remains within the margin of error the data also show that pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category 
the presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch hillary maintains an advantage leading in colorado and pennsylvania but at this point anything can happen said titus bond director of remington research group 
other state polling data came out on sunday that also showed a closerace between trump and clinton although the polls were surveyed before fbi director james comeys announcement that they were reopening their investigation against clinton  via realclearpolitics  florida new york timessiena trump  percent clinton  percent nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent colorado cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent arizona cbsyougov trump  percent clinton  percent north carolina nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent pennsylvania cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent 
the fact that some of these polls were close even before the comey announcement led to this observation from fivethirtyeights nate silver both things can be true  comey impact overblown  nate silver natesilver october   
radio host steve deace writes at conservative review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of clinton the renewed fbi investigation could have a potentially huge impact on election day 
trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like arizona georgia utah indiana and alaska that rarely go blue on election day its quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the clintons could sway the bulk of republicanleaning undecideds trumps way but thats provided of course that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as hes been prone to do then theres the matter of trumps emerging evan mcmullin headache in utah 
if trump can be disciplined this final week his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on iowa nevada florida ohio and north carolina those five states would get him within striking distance to  electoral college votes and then you hope you can pull an upset in colorado pennsylvania or new mexico where trump is visiting during the campaigns final week the hope is that theres enough voters in those states wearier of clintons corruption than worried about whether trumps fit for office

barack obama must be pretty worried 
earlier this week white house press secretary josh earnest told the media that fbi director james comeys decision to reopen an investigation into hillary clinton didnt spring from bias or politics he explained  
director comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the fbi was considered by the united states senate they speak to his good character and the presidents assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed for example the president doesnt believe that director comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election and the president doesnt believe hes secretly supporting a candidate or political party hes in a tough spot hes the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties 
now with the polls closing to within the margin of error president obama has had second thoughts he told nowthisnews  
i do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks we operate based on concrete decisions that are made when this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the fbi the conclusion of the justice department the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasnt anything there that was prosecutable 
its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo his department of justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism his irs used innuendo to destroy conservative cs his entire  campaign was rooted in innuendo about mitt romneys supposed secret evils 
but more than anything the obama flip here shows serious desperation what changed the polls on monday it looked like the fbi scandal would detract from hillarys polling numbers but wouldnt kill her now it looks like she might go down in flames this shows how faithless obama is  comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened hillarys chances at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo 
if comey has any stones he should resign in protest at obamas accusations hes already been thrown under the bus by his commanderinchief for not playing dead for him long enough to move hillary into the white house hes got no future in his position no matter what he does it would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell obama and his cronies to stuff it now tags",english,dailywire.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg,bias,report new york times profit plummets,desperate obama rips comey dont operate innuendo november barack obama must pretty worried earlier week white house press secretary josh earnest told media fbi director james comeys decision reopen investigation hillary clinton didnt spring bias politics explained director comey man integrity principle well regarded officials parties served senior position bush administration got bipartisan support nomination director fbi considered united states senate speak good character presidents assessment integrity character changed example president doesnt believe director comey trying influence outcome election president doesnt believe hes secretly supporting candidate political party hes tough spot hes one position defend actions face significant criticism variety legal experts including officials served senior justice position presidents led parties polls closing within margin error president obama second thoughts told nowthisnews think norm investigations dont operate innuendo dont operate incomplete information dont operate leaks operate based concrete decisions made investigated thoroughly last time conclusion fbi conclusion justice department conclusion repeated congressional investigations made mistakes wasnt anything prosecutable worthwhile pointing hypocrisy obamas entire administration built innuendo department justice destroyed police departments around country unsubstantiated innuendo systemic racism irs used innuendo destroy conservative cs entire campaign rooted innuendo mitt romneys supposed secret evils anything obama flip shows serious desperation changed polls monday looked like fbi scandal would detract hillarys polling numbers wouldnt kill looks like might go flames shows faithless obama comey wonderful point threatened hillarys chances point became slanderer trafficking innuendo comey stones resign protest obamas accusations hes already thrown bus commanderinchief playing dead long enough move hillary white house hes got future position matter would final redeeming move honor tell obama cronies stuff tags,1,Real

uhoh 
according to bret baier of fox news the fbi has been investigating the clinton foundation for over a year and that investigation has been deep and wide  and just as importantly the fbi is on the verge of indictment for payforplay with regard to hillarys state department the fbi investigation has uncovered laptops from clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed 
and most importantly of all  the sources at the fbi have apparently told baier with  percent accuracy that hillarys server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies and information was withdrawn 
meanwhile we now know that the department of justice attempted to pressure the fbi into shutting down the investigation into the clinton foundation entirely according to the wall street journal  the fbi deputy director even asked the doj if they truly wanted to shut down a validly predicated investigation 
this is devastating information for hillary 
donald trump is now leading in florida ohio nevada iowa and north carolina trump is within spitting distance in colorado and pennsylvania and two new polls show trump up in virginia and new hampshire respectively if trump picks off any of those latter states he wins the election 
the best case scenario for hillary clinton just days ago was simple hunker down and wait out these scandals assume that as time goes on the race will revert back to its precomey normal with hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead but each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the clinton foundation and state department each new day demonstrates the extent of the coverup by the obama administration

EdJenner,2016-11-04T16:28:54.446+02:00,obama talks about himself  times in speeches supposedly about hillary," things you need to know about trump and sex slave island by amanda prestigiacomo may   
presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at hillary clinton when it comes to her husbands escapades the kitchen sink in this case is jeffery epsteins sex slave island and president bill clintons ties to it  
why wouldnt trump use this ammo the answer is simple trump himself has ties to epstein the billionaire democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having underage sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls sex slave island 
here are seven connections between trump and epsteins sex slave endeavors that you need to know about 
 trump himself has said that epstein is a lot of fun to be with adding that he admired the sex offenders affinity for beautiful women on the younger side 
ive known jeff for fifteen years terrific guy trump once said about the convicted sex offender hes a lot of fun to be with it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side no doubt about it  jeffrey enjoys his social life 
 trump was named in epsteins little black book 
epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in  the book nicknamed the holy grail by the employee revealed the name of donald trump and listed  phone numbers including emergency numbers car numbers and numbers to trumps security guard and houseman 
 trump has allegedly flown on epsteins private plane  a hot spot for underage sex orgies 
mark epstein jeffreys brother testified in  that trump flew on jeffreys private jet at least once reports vice news  meanwhile message pads see below from epsteins palm beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by vice news indicate that trump called epstein twice in november of  
epsteins private boeing  according to one of his alleged victims virginia roberts was nicknamed the lolita express roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just  years of age with epstein and his friends 
 both trump and epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underaged girl 
radar online reports that a woman in california identified as katie johnson filed a  million lawsuit against trump on april  accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just  years old 
johnson claims trump raped her when she was yearsold and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family notes the independent uk  she claims the alleged abuse took place over a fourmonth period at underage sex parties held in new york city in  epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats 
trumps team adamantly denies the accusation suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists 
 epstein admitted to knowing trump under oath and curiously pled the fifth to trump attending sex parties with underage girls 
back in  epstein admitted to socializing with trump but when a lawyer representing an underaged victim of epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  epstein curiously pled the fifth per vice news  q have you ever had a personal relationship with donald trump a what do you mean by personal relationship sir q have you socialized with him a yes sir q yes a yes sir q have you ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  a though id like to answer that question at least today im going to have to assert my fifth sixth and th amendment rights sir 
 at least one of epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from trumps maralago  which he frequented often 
virginia roberts an alleged victim of epsteins was recruited to perform a massage for epstein while working as a perhour locker room attendant at maralago 
roberts claims that epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends including englands prince andrew over the years the passengers on epsteins jet she said included a whole bunch of other girls sometimes famous people sometimes some politicians 
 trump was subpoenaed in  for his connection to epsteins underage sex slave rings trump has denied ever being served 
in  trump was subpoenaed in a case against epstein concerning victim virginia roberts trumps attorney alan garten said that the subpoena never happened

EdJenner,2016-11-04T16:48:40.920+02:00,obama tells black voters trump would tolerate kkk support in office,"christie lost republicans the  election he may be losing them the  election too by ben shapiro november   
ambition can be dangerous not just for the ambitious man or woman but for the country  for all those who ally with the ambitious person 
for the last eight years one of the most ambitious men in politics has been new jersey governor chris christie hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in new jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an upandcomer in presidential politics  christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the republican party in two straight presidential elections 
in  christie was considered and rejected for vice president by mitt romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the republican convention there he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders ignoring romney completely fox news chris wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech i have ever heardfor a moment i forgot who was the nominee of the party 
then the week before the election hurricane sandy hit the east coast while new york governor andrew cuomo told president obama that his presence was unnecessary christie invited obama to new jersey then hugged him and took him on a tour of atlantic city where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies i cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state christie said adding that it was my honor to introduce president obama christie was at the time facing down rumors that thennewark mayor corey booker who is black would run against him as the new york times noted the scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge 
obama surged in the final days and beat romney handily 
fast forward three years 
christie was running in the republican primaries hed done nothing much in the polls his only hope was to somehow do well in new hampshire he had no support in states like south carolina or nevada or southern states dominated by support for donald trump ted cruz and marco rubio so naturally he used his presence at the debate before the new hampshire primary  a state in which rubio was surging following his iowa showing  to destroy rubio christie rightly labeled rubio a robotic candidate rubio repeated himself christie hit him again  and rubio fell apart in the polling trump ran away with the state almost immediately christie quit the race and fell in behind trump thanks in large part to christies help trump won the nomination 
now with trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against hillary clinton christie has struck again this time two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to bridgegate the scandal in which the christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local democrat who wouldnt endorse christies reelection bid  this story will allow the media to shift its focus to the trump campaign since christie is leader of trumps white house transition team in a tight election it could be enough to hand hillary the white house 
so thanks chris christie 
the democrats couldnt have done it without you tags",english,dailywire.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg,bias,obama tells black voters trump would tolerate kkk support office,christie lost republicans election may losing election ben shapiro november ambition dangerous ambitious man woman country ally ambitious person last eight years one ambitious men politics new jersey governor chris christie hailed conservative darling taking teachers unions new jersey brash language punching face marked rise political force upandcomer presidential politics christie nearly singlehandedly destroyed republican party two straight presidential elections christie considered rejected vice president mitt romney gave keynote speech primetime republican convention spent bulk time talking wonders ignoring romney completely fox news chris wallace called speech curious keynote speech ever heardfor moment forgot nominee party week election hurricane sandy hit east coast new york governor andrew cuomo told president obama presence unnecessary christie invited obama new jersey hugged took tour atlantic city made political love along boardwalk underneath cloudy skies cannot thank president enough personal concern compassion state christie said adding honor introduce president obama christie time facing rumors thennewark mayor corey booker black would run new york times noted scene played televisions around country like stirring campaign ad hit themes bipartisanship crisis management run free charge obama surged final days beat romney handily fast forward three years christie running republican primaries hed done nothing much polls hope somehow well new hampshire support states like south carolina nevada southern states dominated support donald trump ted cruz marco rubio naturally used presence debate new hampshire primary state rubio surging following iowa showing destroy rubio christie rightly labeled rubio robotic candidate rubio repeated christie hit rubio fell apart polling trump ran away state almost immediately christie quit race fell behind trump thanks large part christies help trump nomination trump surging polls week general election hillary clinton christie struck time two top aides found guilty charges related bridgegate scandal christie administration allegedly blocked bridges order punish local democrat wouldnt endorse christies reelection bid story allow media shift focus trump campaign since christie leader trumps white house transition team tight election could enough hand hillary white house thanks chris christie democrats couldnt done without tags,1,Real

EdJenner,2016-11-06T04:10:18.147+02:00,clinton emails use arab female agitators to shame israel," stupid things voxcoms matthew yglesias has said by aaron bandler october   
matt yglesias of vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like  tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations 
fortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly 
here are  things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb 
 yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare that is until he didnt  mattyglesias obamacare marker  which was solid as of  minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig  omri ceren cerenomri october   
his  piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten 
in other words yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of  percent 
 yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov bobby jindal r in a  tweet that is now deleted yglesias wrote is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping 
yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode 
eventually yglesias backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff 
the irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff  jon gabriel exjon june   
 yglesias once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in  that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option 
i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn 
yglesias agreed 
ive long held a related theory about eric cantor 
anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch??boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted 
 yglesias advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space yglesias wrote a  piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical  outdated yglesias pontificated 
northern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time 
yet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time 
but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone 
ygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy 
if the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at  most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at  thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at  and lands in paris at  is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at  you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas 
pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesiass time zone piece was writing at ricochet  i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about 
apparently they dont 
 yglesias doesnt understand floridas geography very well yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in  in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami 
id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know yglesias said 
people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish 
yes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update 
except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  maybe yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud 
 yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government 
for better or for worse thats politics yglesias wrote at thinkprogress  
on twitter yglesias attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes 
and yet yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter 
yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident 
 yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in  that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in  will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused  veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency 
 yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the senate yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in  per the guardian  
if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the  of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator  percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent  percent of the american population 
now of course texas is also a big state though at  percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just  senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain  percent of the population the other  senators represent about  percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them 
in three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations 
 yglesias doesnt understand americas financial system yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a  slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were  at the time yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 
 they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems  they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation  they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance 
davis debunked yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in  
yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist  im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation 
 yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a  thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself à la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist 
this is patently false as damon root explained in reason  
actually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled  autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the  presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal 
 yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death yglesias tweeted  conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead 
this tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion 
apparently slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level and yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities",english,dailywire.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg,bias,clinton emails use arab female agitators shame israel,stupid things voxcoms

EdJenner,2016-11-09T18:45:42.731+02:00,the  biggest losers in donald trumps stunning victory,"the media lost all of its political power last night  thank you donald trump by john nolte november   
the morally dark obamaera is over and utterly and totally repudiated the clintons have finally and forever been staked in their mercenary black hearts our smug supremacist overlords in the elite establishment of both parties these rotting rentseeking parasites are now vanquished but nothing is grander nothing is more glorious nothing is more satisfying nothing is sweeter nothing is more validating nothing is better for america than the death of the mainstream medias political power 
the elite national political media is done as a force moral or otherwise in this country done buried exposed over out and using a slowacting poison called hubris it was death by suicide so smug so sure of themselves so sanctimonious so snarkfilled so utterly incapable of anything close to selfreflection 
the selfinduced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps 
here they are 
 pimping for obamacare 
the national political media didnt just cheerlead for obamacare they lied to us willfully and with malicious intent they all lied to us the outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill right there in black and white but the media didnt care they wanted to give their precious obama a win and in order to do that they jumped on board the you can keep your insurance propaganda express worse those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken factcheckers 
then utopia met reality 
then the lies were exposed 
and the result is that up to and including last night at both the local and national level obamacare has decimated the democrat party but nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class 
the medias role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority from here on they could only get more sweaty desperate and dangerous 
 casting off every journalistic ethic to destroy trump 
openly proudly and belligerently in order to hijack a presidential election we were treated to the pompous announcement that trump was such a threat to humanity it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism starting with objectivity 
even former good guys like cnns jake tapper morphed into an unrecognizable lyingsnarkvirtuesignalingmachines  another rotting cog in the narrative wheel a mindless member of a selfdeluded governmentworshiping cult that wouldnt piss on middle america if we were on fire 
professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag baby and who could miss the historic opportunity to selfrighteously pointandlaugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a brave new world 
 grind donald trump to dust 
while there is no question trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way never in my  years have i seen such a coordinated desperate dishonest and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity 
 embracing confirmation bias 
the longer the general election rolled on the smaller the bubble of selfdelusion became 
inconvenient polls were sneered at and voxsplained away 
exit polls could only means one thing even though it was pretty clear they might mean another 
my personal favorite was the late editorials where based on no counted votes whatsoever we were trolled with the news that it was hillary not trump who would emerge victorious with the hidden vote oh the delicious irony of that oh how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes faces on election night 
by the time the votes were actually being counted i was about  sure hillary would win the new york times however was  sure abcnbccbsapbsnprcnnwashingtonpostpolitico were  sure 
but even i understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever that hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper midwest that the best pollster in the country had trump up  that trump never lost his fervent base that the right trackwrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade that there was still a largerthanusual number of undecideds that this thing that was real might not be enough to win but it was still real 
no no we were told its all smoke and mirrors all goldleafed trump steaks look at obamas approval ratings look at the hispanic vote look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there sit down son dont you understand that im a data machine its science rube dont you vox racist 
and then the worst thing imaginable happened 
 the media lost the election 
the hate the lies the removal of the mask of objectivity the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table  that can actually work  if you win 
but the media didnt win 
in the most spectacular fashion with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see they lost 
and with that loss went everything 
and now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a swaggering potemkin bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man and do so with much of the republican party on their side 
not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch worse than all that they are exposed as weak a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again 
without that sheen of fear without that threat of intimidation like a vanquished bully so goes all their power 
f you mainstream media 
 
the delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious barack obama correct about one thing 
the moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice

EdJenner,2016-11-11T05:42:29.253+02:00,limbaugh perfectly sums up why the lefts unwilling to face why trump really won,"poll sexism was not a factor in hillarys loss by aaron bandler november   
some leftists still reeling from hillary clintons stunning defeat on tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president however a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in clintons loss 
the poll conducted by conquest communications group and published on just facts  featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism if you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate who would you vote for 
here were the results emphasis added 
overall  of voters said it does not matter  preferred a female  preferred a male  were unsure and  refused to answer 
male voters and trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say it does not matter at  and  respectively the other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error with rates of  for clinton voters  for undecided voters  for females 
naturally supporters of trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president percent to  percent respectivelyand clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president  percent to  percent respectively 
the survey was conducted from october  so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election but its hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists 
there is a little bias towards a male president among trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among clinton voters but the results of the survey suggest that overall the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the united states

presidentelect donald trump that is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people as he was not expected to win on tuesday what were the driving factors that propelled trump to the presidency how was he able to pull off such a stunning upset 
here are seven reasons why trump won 
 hillary clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her last night dems were calling the race a whitelash  wrong mitt won  of white vote trump won  minority voters didnt turn out  david french davidafrench november   
in fact trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than mitt romney did in  as the daily wire has explained  
unsurprisingly trump lost to clinton in the latino and black votes by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent and  percent respectively surprisingly this was better than romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in  as he lost both groups by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent to  percent respectively 
michael barone has noted that turnout fell in heavily black philadelphia cleveland detroit and milwaukee millennial generation turnout was tepid and trump carried white millennials by  points 
the enthusiasm was just not there for clinton 
 trump was able to pull in former obama voters according to the washington post  trump was able to win over onethird of the  counties that went for obama twice clinton was only able to win six of the  counties that didnt go for obama trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than clinton was 
so who are these former obama voters who voted for trump in  and what caused them to switch 
 these former obama voters felt that trump cared about them and the democrat party did not john daniel davidson explains in the federalist that clinton and the democrat party took the bluecollar working class whites in the rust belt for grantedexemplified by clintons pledge to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessand it was to their detriment the rust belt has been in economic decline for years but it has suffered greatly from the obama administrations regulations towards coal 
while the democrats wrote off the rust belt trump actually acknowledged their struggles and that was all it took 
trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them acknowledged that they have been left behind that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline and promised to help out somehow writes davidson when youre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion as president obama did in  or denounced as deplorables and irredeemable as hillary clinton did during this election respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions from washington or anywhere else to the problems that plague your town 
 the fbi reopening its investigation into hillarys emails helped trump per redstate  author ed klein said on the steve malzberg show that clinton was sobbing inconsolably on election night and was blaming fbi director james comey reopening the investigation as well as obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost 
theres no question that the reopening of the investigation did considerably help trump as the polls severely tightened after the announcement poll numbers showed that the vast majority of americans felt that hillary was acting in an immoral manner the spotlight was off of trumps vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers and instead the focus was on clintons private email server but clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss 
 hillary was a terrible candidate if clinton had been elected president she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous fbi investigations she broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official state department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the clinton foundation  clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure sleaze and corruption basically clinton is an obama democrat without obamas charm according to jonah goldberg  
she may have been the only democratic candidate that could lose to trump and the democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning they have no one to blame but themselves for president trump 
 the public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes latenight comics will rahn wrote at cbs news that the unbearable smugness of the clintonbiased media was offputting to a lot of voters as they sneered at trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up clinton trumps vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically poll numbers reflect this as trust in the media has declined over the years rahn explains 
journalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way we see this in the ongoing veneration of facts the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously postideological 
that the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soulsearching youd think it would instead it all just somehow leads us to more smugness more meanness more certainty from the reporters and pundits faced with defeat we retreat further into our bubble assumptions left unchecked no its the voters who are wrong 
as a direct result we get it wrong with greater frequency out on the road we forget to ask the right questions we cant even imagine the right question we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases the publics estimation of the press declines even further  fewer than oneinthree americans trust the press per gallup  which starts the cycle anew 
the same applies to latenight comics mollie hemingway writes in the federalist that jon stewart is partly responsible for the election of trump because of how he singlehandedly destroyed cnns crossfire resulting in a new age of hyperpolitical hyperliberal latenight comedy stewarts the daily show spawned stephen colbert john oliver trevor noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy leftwing political lectures talking down to conservatives 
jon stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day writes hemingway he got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree the results include a further erosion of civility a decrease in americans ability to understand each other and their concerns and of all things presidentelect donald trump 
which all culminates into the main reason why trump was elected 
 americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites ben shapiro explains  
trump won because many americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as barack obama and his department of justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country 
trump won because many americans were sick of watching other americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance  for their religious beliefs for their unwillingness to label women men and men women for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates 
trump won because many americans were tired of the medias constant harping on americas flaws  we were supposedly sexist racist and homophobic americans said that they did not believe the media and they were right to do so 
in other words the left has been tearing down america as a country infested with intolerant prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives the people finally had had enough so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites

this is the best picture in human history 
it is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties the republic and why we are where we are 
on the left side of this picture we have donald trump  a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian the new presidentelect of the united states he points his fingers and smiles that apprentice smile as he makes a point 
on the right side of this picture we have barack obama  a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant he sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office and obama rightly looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes 
behind obama sits a bust of abraham lincoln his eyes downcast mourning for his country 
yep 
greatest picture ever 
this is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant barack obamas image of himself is not accurate  to americans obama is a reality tv show star he transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfiestick celebrityridden sinkhole of hollywood glitterati hobnobbing with glozell and macklemore cracking wise about the presidency with jimmy kimmel before saying that a reality star like trump could never be president 
this picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost as obamas former pastor might put it 
and then theres lincoln 
lincoln who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration mourning behind barack obama who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain 
lincoln who represented wisdom mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd given republicans domination of the senate and the congress i have hopes for trumps presidency  i hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises  but trump occupying lincolns office is at best a jarring visual

EdJenner,2016-11-13T23:00:28.986+02:00,california cafe wants legal fees paid by muslim women who sued them,"frank camp november   
during an interview with lesley stahl for  minutes  which will air in its entirety sunday night donald trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants 
we are getting them out of our country the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized were going to make a determination on the people youre talking about who are terrific people theyre terrific people who were going to make a determination on but before we make a determination we want to secure our border 
gasp 
donald trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration throughout the primary process he promised a  deportation force  telling msnbcs mika brzezinski in november  
youre going to have a deportation force and youre going to do it humanely dont forget mika that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and theyre waiting to come in legally and i always say the wall were going to build the wall its going to be a real deal its going to be a real wall 
in august trump delivered a major immigration speech in phoenix arizona in which he softened his stance a bit focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes 
within ice i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice 
he then added that anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation that is what it means to have laws and to have a country otherwise we dont have a country 
during the final presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton trump reiterated his position against amnesty 
well first of all clinton wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many many years we need strong borders 
for trump diehards these statements were enough their guy was going to deport  million illegal immigrants and no one would tell them otherwise however as anyone with access to google should know the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion 
in july  donald trump told cnns dana bash 
i would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legala lot of these people are helping usand sometimes its jobs a citizen of the united states doesnt want to do i want to move em out and were going to move em back in and let them be legal 
what trump was talking about is known as touchback amnesty such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants but allow them an expedited means of returning to the united states in order to obtain legal status in other words they touch base in their home country then come right back 
in november  eric trump repeated his fathers plan during an interview with fox news megyn kelly 
the point isnt just deporting them its deporting them and letting them back in legally hes been so clear about that and i know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it but its deporting them and letting them back legally 
going back further trumps support for amnesty is even more stark speaking on fox  friends in  he said 
for people that have been here for years that have been hardworkers have good jobs theyre supporting their familyits very very tough to just say by the way  years you have to leave get outim one of the worlds very conservative people but i have to tell you on a human basis how do you throw somebody out thats lived in this country for twenty years 
during the  presidential election cycle trump even called mitt romneys idea of selfdeportation  maniacal  and remarked that republican party policy toward illegal immigrants was  meanspirited

EdJenner,2016-11-14T15:18:26.396+02:00,watch traffic reporters savage message to those who threatened to leave us if trump won," thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist by ben shapiro november   
so in a notunexpected move donald trump has elevated former breitbart news ceo steve bannon to chief strategist of the white house 
when i left breitbart back in march i accused bannon of turning breitbart news into trump pravda  as i wrote indeed breitbart news under the chairmanship of steve bannon has put a stake through the heart of andrews legacy in my opinion steve bannon is a bully and has sold out andrews mission in order to back another bully donald trump he has shaped the company into trumps personal pravda to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter 
that decision paid off for bannon  in august he became trumps campaign ceo at that point i wrote this piece describing who bannon was  and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign  
with bannons accession to a top white house role its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do 
is bannon antisemitic and racist i have no evidence that bannons a racist or that hes an antisemite the huffington posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated at the very least with that said as i wrote at the washington post in august bannon has openly embraced the racist and antisemitic altright  he called his breitbart  the platform of the altright  milo yiannopoulos the star writer at the site is an altright popularizer  even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member the lefts opposition to trump and their attempts to declare all trump support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is the movement isnt all trump supporters its not conservatives unsatisfied with paul ryan nor is it people angry at the media bannon knows that hes a smart man not an ignorant one the altright in a nutshell believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity  i have no evidence bannon believes that personally but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european farright nationalist populism that means that the altright will cheer bannon along as he marbles trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that bannon wont be pushing trump to dump the racists and antisemites who support trump anytime soon after all they love bannon  actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news and richard spencer explained breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart in this way breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers i dont think it has done this deliberately again its a matter of elective affinities that doesnt mean bannon will push racist or antisemitic policy or that hell be antiisrael himself  unless it serves his interests 
what does bannons accession mean bannon has goals one of those goals is maximization of personal power which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities bachmann morris palin kissing their asses and then moving on up the chain with breitbart and trump he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power 
so what will he do with that power hell target enemies bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics which is why ive been joking for months that should trump win id be expecting my irs audit any moment that wasnt completely a joke he likes to destroy people 
but more importantly bannons interested in turning the republican party into a farright european party because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that it could happen heres what i wrote in march about the trump movement  
trump is a europeanstyle response to the europeanstyle leftism of barack obama hes a soft europeanstyle populist from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy as i wrote in december compare trumps platform with that of marine le pen whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment she calls for harsher penalties for criminals significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france protectionism on trade a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro and big government in terms of health care this sounds a lot like trump but the european right is not the american right the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government the european right doesnt believe any of these things should trump win we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had 
thats the plan yesterday the daily beast reported that bannon reached out to le pen for global ultraright coalition over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party and trump met with farage shortly after being elected bannon has always wanted to burn down the gop thats still his goal he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name 
which war will bannon lead bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war always so the only question left is this what will bannons actual role be its difficult to tell since trump announced the bannon hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff what will their relationship be like ed morrissey of hotair thinks that bannon will lead the antimedia fight and reince will coordinate with congress that would be the best possible scenario 
others have speculated that bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base which would be angry at trump hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in washington that too would be fine 
its hard to tell from the outside whats happening but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for trump and bannons whispering in trumps ear that would fit the fact pattern here given reinces outsized praise for bannon this morning wise and smartvery very smart very temperate bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to bannons agenda 
if bannons leading and reince is following that bodes ill for the republican agenda bannon opposes the republican party hates paul ryan  minutes after the joint bannonpriebus announcement breitbart news approvingly tweeted about a congressional rebellion against speaker ryan  and wants to watch it all burn bannon loves the firefight the only question is which direction hell turn his fire

daily wire editorinchief ben shapiro spoke at the university of wisconsinmadison on wednesday night and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium 
after the ovation he received on entering shapiro quipped hey look at this a campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when i come he continued before i begin i did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room i hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful terrible trump people that youre sensitive and that you want to signal your virtue so ive brought along these safety pins holding up safety pins and i also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper 
shapiro then held up a diaper prompting huge laughs from the audience 
when a protester yelled at shapiro that he should be wearing a swastika shapiro held out his yarmulke then fired back in case you hadnt noticed the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type 
shapiro continued stop being selfindulgent children stop pretending that everybody who voted for trump is a vicious racist its your right to protest of course but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a dulyheld election  donald trump doesnt care about your protest donald trump is sitting somewhere in trump tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty salty tears 
referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending shapiros lecture shapiro opined i hear that a lot of folks at this publiclyfunded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants i do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally why are so many people trying to ban american citizens from this community from coming to this lecture and by the way im aware of this private facebook page titled f white supremacy interrupting ben shapiro with all due respect f you right back gang 
after the applause subsided and shapiro joked about how both black lives mater and the kkk target him the real fun began protesters stood up chanting shame over and over again 
shapiro quipped wow its like game of thrones  should i get undressed and walk down the aisle 
the bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters shapiro addressed the protesters saying im happy to talk with you but they responded by screaming safety over and over shapiro joked did somebody fart the crowd responded to the protesters by chanting usa 
shapiro replied i tell you try not to be children the first thing you do is start screaming like my twoyearold he added you see this is how conservatives actually treat people you stand up and you interrupt and you shout safety and youre perfectly safe look at that its amazing that provoked sustained applause 
when the protesters started screaming shame again shapiro eviscerated them pointing out if youre going to pick a chant like shame watch game of thrones first the bad guys shout shame the audience loved that line on a roll shapiro continued youre not changing anybodys mind all youre showing everybody is that your collective iq if it were channeled into electricity night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly 
he continued okay can we talk now or are you going to keep shouting nows your chance to get it out lets hear your feelings cmon just go for it or is it going to be like every thirty seconds like an annoying microwave timer 
when the protesters resumed chanting shapiro responded if you guys want to talk we can talk if you want to shout get the hell out more applause 
shapiro fired for gods sake at least wait until i say something that offends you before getting offended 
shapiro returned to deconstructing the term social justice when the protesters started again a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak that prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and shapiro too he added see thats what a decent hardworking person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime presumably 
shapiro returned to his speech racial diversity doesnt mean anything decency means everything  diversity isnt our strength decency is our strength he turned to the protesters remember that decency 
the protesters screamed back shame shapiro fired back decency the protesters chanted shame but the crowd soon joined shapiro in chanting decency shutting the protesters up 
as shapiro spoke of the falsity of white privilege the protesters formed a line in front of shapiro prompting him to quip if you guys are all going to come up here can we all just have circle time or something 
the protesters chanted safety for a minute and a half but then the crowd started yelling back free speech matters shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters morons that again prompted cheering 
one member of the audience yelled to the protesters at least tell us what you want or otherwise just get out that brought a sustained ovation 
after one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue the protesters started shouting safety again then filed out yelling f white supremacy while flipping off shapiro and the entire audience that prompted the crowd to sing nananana nananana hey hey goodbye it also promoted this from shapiro 
even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door 
after shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event he continued all i can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event 
even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door prompting shapiro to quip doesnt this school give homework does anybody have a job around here i guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands 
shapiro noted that he had engaged in a backandforth with one of the protesters who accused him of being a white supremacist when he asked her why she thought so she replied that she got that impression from his image he fired back really was it the yarmulke that did it for you 
he took another shot at the protesters during the speech noting that people were born unequal and adding some people us are born rich some of us are born poor some of us are born smart some of us are born protesters 
the rest of the speech was vintage shapiro as was the qa afterward even the chalk was impressive

EdJenner,2016-11-17T02:43:29.321+02:00,the week after trumps win the reaction of liberal college students," things you need to know about sanctuary cities by aaron bandler november   
with donald trump elected to the presidency one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens the issue became frontandcenter during the early portion of the republican primary when trump decried the murder of kate steinle by an illegal alien in san francisco a sanctuary city 
in response to the election of trump leftist city leaders are digging in officials in los angeles chicago and boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal governments deportation efforts here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities 
 sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law some on the left have tried to claim that theyre perfectly legal but this is clearly false as james walsh  former associate general counsel of immigration and naturalization services explains  usc section  deals with those persons who knowingly conceal harbor or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states 
the fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means theyre supporting a form of nullification an irony not missed by victor davis hanson  
much of the rural west opposes the endangered species act can wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales could oklahoma city declare handgun purchases within its citylimits free of federal firearms statutes perhaps little rock could ignore a supreme court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction on what rationale would liberals in california object to such nullifications  that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials 
trump and the gop can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law 
 sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job some police officers in the los angeles police department lapd expressed their frustration with the citys sanctuary city policy to heather mac donald in  
we cant even talk about it says a frustrated lapd captain people are afraid of a backlash from hispanics another lapd commander in a predominantly hispanic ganginfested district sighs i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals 
in that  piece mac donald documents how members of the lapd were able to recognize known gang members but couldnt do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime  despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country this is the case with other sanctuary cities as well 
 sanctuary cities are akin to roulette the odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ice for deportation writes hanson on the chance that some of their  released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of juan lopezsanchez officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens 
but the odds dont suggest this hanson notes that according to mac donald twothirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of los angeles involved illegal aliens  as well as  of outstanding murder warrants 
additionally jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies found that in a ninemonth timeframe in  sanctuary cities shielded  illegals from deportation  percent of which had significant prior criminal histories and  of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes according to daniel horowitz at conservative review 
there is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught writes horowitz this is just a ninemonth snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies as of last year  of them were still at large so much for not being a flight risk 
according to vaughn  from january  to september   sanctuary cities rebuked over  detainers  percent of which involved individuals with a prior criminal history 
based on these statistics it would seem that the odds are against the cities residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens which makes it no surprise that 
 crime has surged in sanctuary cities the daily wire s hank berrien reported on the following from louisiana attorney general jeff landry 
according to louisiana attorney general jeff landry crime has risen in sanctuary cities across the nation 
landry told the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration and border security that sanctuary city policies allow illegals to commit crimes then roam free in our communities landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of new orleans where city police are now banned from asking an individuals immigration status 
using recent statistics from los angeles another sanctuary city landry asserted los angeles saw all crime rise in  violent crime up  percent homicides up  percent shooting victims up  percent rapes up  percent robberies up  percent and aggravated assault up  percent  sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base 
this would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime  
 there are an estimated  sanctuary cities counties and states according to vaughn the full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here  do you live in a sanctuary city",english,dailywire.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg,bias,week trumps win reaction liberal college students,things need know sanctuary cities aaron bandler november donald trump elected presidency one policies likely come fire sanctuary cities cities policies make safe havens illegal aliens issue became frontandcenter early portion republican primary trump decried murder kate steinle illegal alien san francisco sanctuary city response election trump leftist city leaders digging officials los angeles chicago boston signaling cooperate federal governments deportation efforts five things need know sanctuary cities sanctuary cities blatant violation federal law left tried claim theyre perfectly legal clearly false james walsh former associate general counsel immigration naturalization services explains usc section deals persons knowingly conceal harbor shield undocumented aliens could apply officials sanctuary cities states fact leftists digging heels sanctuary cities means theyre supporting form nullification irony missed victor davis hanson much rural west opposes endangered species act wyoming declare federally protected rats bugs protected inside state borders pests obstruct construction dams highways many conservatives oppose federal restrictions gun sales could oklahoma city declare handgun purchases within citylimits free federal firearms statutes perhaps little rock could ignore supreme court ruling announce gay marriage legal within jurisdiction rationale would liberals california object nullifications neither state city right ignore federal law obstruct law enforcement duties federal officials trump gop fight sanctuary cities cutting federal funding sending federal agents mandate cities follow law sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement refuse cooperate federal agents deporting illegals sanctuary cities make difficult police officers job police officers los angeles police department lapd expressed frustration citys sanctuary city policy heather mac donald cant even talk says frustrated lapd captain people afraid backlash hispanics another lapd commander predominantly hispanic ganginfested district sighs would get firestorm criticism talked enforcing immigration law illegals piece mac donald documents members lapd able recognize known gang members couldnt anything apprehend committed crime despite fact illegals repeatedly snuck back country case sanctuary cities well sanctuary cities akin roulette odds suggest illegal aliens detained officials career felons thus supposedly need turned ice deportation writes hanson chance released criminals go commit crimes manner juan lopezsanchez officials shrug public outcry episodic quickly die least pose political problems great would come deporting aliens odds dont suggest hanson notes according mac donald twothirds outstanding felony warrants city los angeles involved illegal aliens well outstanding murder warrants additionally jessica vaughn center immigration studies found ninemonth timeframe sanctuary cities shielded illegals deportation percent significant prior criminal histories subsequently rearrested new crimes according daniel horowitz conservative review telling many committed crimes never caught writes horowitz ninemonth snapshot devastation sanctuary policies last year still large much flight risk according vaughn january september sanctuary cities rebuked detainers percent involved individuals prior criminal history based statistics would seem odds cities residents could harmed criminal aliens makes surprise crime surged sanctuary cities daily wire hank berrien reported following louisiana attorney general jeff landry according louisiana attorney general jeff landry crime risen sanctuary cities across nation landry told house judiciary committees subcommittee immigration border security sanctuary city policies allow illegals commit crimes roam free communities landrys appearance prompted changed status new orleans city police banned asking individuals immigration status using recent statistics los angeles another sanctuary city landry asserted los angeles saw crime rise violent crime percent homicides percent shooting victims percent rapes percent robberies percent aggravated assault percent sanctuary cities encourage illegal immigration promote underground economy sabotages tax base would make sense given aforementioned statistics fact clear link illegal immigration crime estimated sanctuary cities counties states according vaughn full map jurisdictions seen live sanctuary city,1,Real

as a woman who rejects thirdwave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis ive had my fair share of feminists tell me that i only reject them and their ideas because i suffer from internalized misogyny or in other words im a selfloathing sexist 
heres exactly how everyday feminism defines internalized misogyny if youre unfamiliar with bats crazy 
internalized misogyny by definition is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women 
it becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate overtly and covertly that women are less than men  less worthy less strong less dependable less able less of a leader less logical  while also more than men more emotional more irrational more complex more to manage 
of course this is ridiculous and i gave such an assertion about as much time as a i would a male feminist hitting on me zero seconds 
but on wednesday i learned that team hillary the political left likewise thought me a selfloathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for queen pantsuit because i couldnt stomach the thought of a powerful woman since i apparently believe women are lessers in fact ia woman with a chronic case of internalized misogynycost hillary the election not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag it was my fault clinton campaign communications director jess_mc on election loss internalized misogyny is a real thing inners httpstcorvtuih  all in wchris hayes allinwithchris november   
yeah no i didnt pull the lever for trump because i hate myself i dont not even a little actually i just hate you 
let me define you 
you are the feminists who contend my uterus must dictate all my choices those who make it their mission to drag down any woman who has the audacity to veer from your ideology one iota 
you are the feminists who tell me that theres a special place in hell for me if i dont cast my ballot for crooked hillary like all of a sudden feminists believe in god and an afterlife lol 
you are the feminists who tell me im super mean and shame women when i point out that bragging about murdering unborn babies is gross and despicable by the way it is gross and despicable  
you are the feminists who demonize men with thinkpieces on how and why we should banish socalled  toxic masculinity  from this world 
you are the feminists who shut men up because of their gender while simultaneously telling me gender is a social construct and no i will not cater to your preferred pronouns you entitled brat protip once the number of genders youve madeup passes the number of flavors at baskin robbins its time to admit you have a problem 
you are the social justice warriors who tell me im a hateful selfish capitalistic pig from your iphone at your local safe space equipped with coloring books bubbles and puppies across from the starbucks you work weekends at 
you are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you dont get your way meanwhile youre not even registered to vote  
you are the social justice warriors shoutingdown any free speech which doesnt perfectly align with your ideology ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness 
you are the virtuesignaling celebrities who think i give a hoot about your political stance please go ahead and move to canada no one will miss you i certainly wont 
you are the mainstream media so desperate for your leftist narrative that youll lie to the american people to advance it so hellbent on painting middleamerica and republicans as racist youll frame actual policy discussions into a segment of whos the biggest xenophobe republican edition 
you are the leftist telling me im a racist for not supporting the divisive hate group black lives matter first of all its mostly comprised of a bunch of loser white kids second of all call me crazy but once you start calling for and actually assassinating police officers  im out i know how racist of me 
you are leftists calling me an islamophobe because i use the term radical islam and resist an influx of refugees whom the fbi said we cannot properly vet pouring into our country 
you see this election had virtually nothing to do with donald trumpi could take him or leave himand almost everything to do with you the left trump was indeed a protest vote he was a direct repudiation of everything you stand for and everything you tell me i should stand for by virtue of my uterus

thats nuts

were still waiting on trumps state and defense picks but hes already out of the gate with senator jeff sessions for attorney general its november  
the media are so eager to bury trumps administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks  steve bannon for example is a rotten pick  but not because hes a racist or antisemite  the media keep proclaiming the end is near this sort of alarmism doesnt convince americans who dont really see why theres any giant rush to appoint people who arent going to be formally considered by the senate until january  anyway 
if this election was about repudiation of the media  and it was  the media arent doing themselves any favors when they promulgate factfree narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets fake news for years americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day each day the media seem determined to prove them right tags",english,dailywire.com,http://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/169large/public/uploads/2016/11/trump_white_house.jpg?itok=jmGBTqky,bias,gallup americans confident trump since election daily wire,media claim trump transition chaos trumps way ahead schedule ben shapiro november media desperately search narrative cast incoming trump administration dangerously incompetent overplaying hands instead focusing nepotistic fact trump relies heavily soninlaw jared kushner daughter ivanka invited state meeting japan theyre trying claim isnt moving fast enough appointments thats nuts barack obama didnt name picks secretary state defense attorney general december nearly month november election george w bush didnt name picks state defense attorney general middecember december colin powell december donald rumsfeld december john ashcroft bill clinton didnt name picks positions least december george hw bush fastest mark named james baker secretary state day november election ronald reagan waited december get started jimmy carter waited december still waiting trumps state defense picks hes already gate senator jeff sessions attorney general november media eager bury trumps administration falling instead soberly covering potential problems top level picks steve bannon example rotten pick hes racist antisemite media keep proclaiming end near sort alarmism doesnt convince americans dont really see theres giant rush appoint people arent going formally considered senate january anyway election repudiation media media arent favors promulgate factfree narratives simultaneously attempting label conservative outlets fake news years americans assumed leftist media ladling fake news day day media seem determined prove right tags,1,Real

presidentelect donald trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is sen jeff sessions ral who has long been a favorite of conservatives the democrats already have the long knives out for sessions spitballing their usual accusations of racismwhich should indicate that sessions will be an effective attorney general 
here are seven things you need to know about sessions 
 sessions has a  percent liberty score on conservative review  sessions has been in the senate for  years and has been described by the washington times as a tea partier before the tea party was cool per conservative review s biography  
 sessions has been one of the leaders in the senate in fighting against amnesty for instance sessions was among the most prominent members of the senate leading the opposition to the gang of eight bill national review  which dubbed sessions amnestys worst enemy explained how sessions would reveal true facts about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadnt decided how to vote on the legislation sessions and sen david vitter rla would find other clever ways to oppose the bill such as an amendment to a resolution honoring the late latino union organizer cesar chavez in which vitter noted chavezs opposition to illegal immigration putting sen bob menendez dnj in an awkward position 
in  sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system according to conservative review  overturned the zadvydas v davis supreme court case that obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off dhs and doj law enforcement grants expedited deportation of gang members applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the washington dc mansion murders 
sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration as he has railed against it as the primary source of lowwage immigration into the united states 
what we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together sessions wrote in a  oped in the washington post  
 sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues according to conservative review s biography of sessions 
in january  he was named ranking member of the senate budget committee in this capacity he led the republican charge against majority leader harry reid and barack obama for not offering a serious budget proposal given that the senate had not passed a budget since april  he has fought guerilla warfare often a lonely battle against democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps he has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the ryanmurray budget deal sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state 
sessions has voted against the tarp bailout stimulus bills and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state with charts warning of the united states crippling debt per the washington post  
 sessions endorsed trump early on to the surprise of many in the establishment sessions endorsed trump in february declaring  i believe we are on a movement that must not fade away this is a campaign this is a movement the american people are not happy with their government 
it shouldnt have come as a surprise though given sessions record on immigration and that sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade 
 sessions is wellliked by his senate colleagues on a personal level according to the washington post  
say what you will about him former longtime senate democratic communications aide jim manley told the almanac of american politics he was always nice to the late ted kennedy and other democrats as well 
even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him stanleybecker talked to susan parker a democrat who tried to unseat sessions in  during a debate she asked for a tissue and sessions handed her one she joked she would use it to dry her eyes when sessions made her cry and he responded please dont say that thats my nightmare i promise ill be nice 
its no wonder then that sessions will likely be confirmed by the senate 
 accusations of racism against sessions are absurd when president ronald reagan nominated sessions who at the time was a us attorney to a federal judge the democrats smeared sessions with accusations of racism which included calling a black attorney boy quipping about the ku klux klan i used to think they were ok but they are pot smokers joking that a white attorney was a traitor to his race because he was collaborating with civil rights groups calling the naacp and aclu unamerican prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud 
the last point isnt racist at all the jokes as ben shapiro has written  were made in front of the black lawyer even the lawyer accusing sessions of racism acknowledged that sessions was joking clearly sessions meant them as harmless jokes sessions has also denied calling the lawyer boy the civil rights group sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years 
sessions record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism as the weekly standard s mark hemingway writes 
as a us attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in alabama and he also prosecuted the head of the state klan henry francis hays for abducting and killing michael donald a black teenager selected at random sessions insisted on the death penalty for hays when he was later elected the state attorney general sessions followed through and made sure the hays executed the successful prosecution of hays also led to a  million civil judgment against the klan effectively breaking the back of the kkk in alabama 
 as attorney general sessions would uphold the rule of law the reason why sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law he has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty between that and his legal background as a us attorney and alabama attorney general there is every reason to believe that sessions will follow the law and not politicize the justice department 
his interpretation of the law will not please everyone but i predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor robert driscoll  former deputy assistant attorney general wrote in national review  clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor creative interpretations of the law may cease but the meatandpotatoes work of the division intentional discrimination police misconduct disability law will continue apace conducted without impropriety or political favoritism that alone will be a breath of fresh air

ryan called trumps infrastructure plan a bunch of smoke and mirrors he added that he didnt blame pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues i cant in good conscience hang this election around nancy pelosis neck of course but moving forward we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for donald trump even in my district where they voted for me and they voted for donald trump

EdJenner,2016-11-21T01:44:30.277+02:00,texas officer shot dead outside police hq,"snowflake colbert didnt want to write jokes about trump winning by hank berrien november   
conversing with fellow daily show comic john oliver at the montclair film festival on saturday night late show unfunny host stephen colbert admitted that he couldnt even conceive that donald trump would win the presidency so much so that he couldnt write jokes bout trump winning for election night 
in the roughly twohour discussion and qa titled wow that was weird montclair film festival executive director tom hall set the somber tone by allowing when we planned this evening i think we all thought wed be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face 
speaking of the late show s election night special on showtime colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired 
there was not a bear big enough in the world that we werent loaded for we were so loaded for every possible eventuality we had so many guests we had so many pretaped pieces all based on a different eventuality we had three shows hillary clinton wins and we know hillary clinton wins and we dont know because its not called before the shows over donald trumps going to win and we dont know because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory thats not wishful thinking thats what everyone was saying 
and then there was the last show which is the show we did which is donald trump is going to win and we know hes going to win my execs and my writers were like you dont want to write something for that and im like no there is nothing you can write you dont understand i have  people in my theater if we know donald trump is going to win its going to be like doing standup comedy for one of those chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives there will be no laughter we only did about  minutes of material before we went f it its going to be him lets just talk for another hour so i think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night 
colbert moaned that the special was the hardest thing ive ever done in my life adding i was tying my tie at  and i went oh he took ohio oh well we expected that he took it by  points wow thats not expected and then over my guests shoulders people kept holding up signs that said florida iowa nebraska he revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared but none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned our audience was sobbing openly and those are people who work for me like my cameramen 
as daily wire editorinchief ben shapiro pointed out years ago  colberts manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives 
he engages in conservativeface he needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative  after all conservatives come in every shape and size instead he acts as though he is a conservative  an idiotic racist sexist bigoted brutal conservative he outarchie bunkers archie bunker his audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious colbert who wishes to persecute gays they chortle at evil sexist colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism this is the purpose of colberts routine his show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks in order to justify their racism racists had to create a false perception of blacks in the same way colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives 
on saturday night colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a trump presidency arguing im all for giving him a chance but dont give him an inch because i believed everything he said and i remember everything he said and its horrifying its possible the job changes a man thats the cliche of the presidency he pontificated 
every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say well there are levers of power in washington that can slow him down but two things one is theyre cowards second is that the levers in washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull because they tried to stop trump everybody tried to stop trump do not delude yourself 
everyone except the people hes going to appoint tried to stop him and they didnt he owes them nothing he goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd shall i do it and they say yes and he says it shall be so and the balcony is twitter he goes onto twitter and he goes what do you think do you think im right thats what scares me that he owes the checks and balances of washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldnt and hes a vindictive person so its all going to be fine merry christmas no there is nothing you can write stephen colbert 
colbert concluded the next person who says to me you must be happy on a certain level is going to have their eye carved out

so soontobeexpresident obama wont be going away anytime soon 
after george w bush left office he essentially went silent he had no criticism for president obama he didnt sound off about mitt romney or donald trump he went away not so for obama it seems that barack obama will follow the jimmy carter pathway to annoyingland hell be commenting whenever possible after acknowledging that bush could not have been more gracious to me when i came in obama said as an american citizen who cares deeply about our country if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals and if i think that its necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals ill examine it when it comes 
this comes as welcome news for republicans obamas policy unpopularity  and his tendency to lecture from on high to americans in rural areas  means that hell suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing trump and republicans middle americans voted for trump in order to sound off against obamas obvious scorn for them heres what obama had to say about those who didnt vote for trump in todays der spiegel  
if you look at the new generation of americans they reflect the vision that i spoke about theyre diverse they believe in tolerance theyre accepting of things like samesex marriage they believe in integration the problem though is that young people are less likely to vote than older people what results is a situation in which sometimes the elections dont fully reflect the views of the american population essentially the presidentelect was supported by about  percent of the american population one of our challenges historically is that we have very low voting rates even during presidential elections 
this sort of language drove americans to trump and if obama continues to critique trump from the outside with this sort of language not only will he be doing trump a favor hell be preventing any other democrat from taking a leading role in opposing trump hell become the point of resistance for his own party  and his party wont be able to escape his shadow

with donald trump set to take office in a couple of months a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration as of this writing there are three protrump pundits that might be in the trump administration 
eric bolling politico reported that bolling was seen at trump tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the department of commerce what exactly that position that will be is not clear bolling told politico that he cant confirm anything 
geraldo rivera flatout asked bolling on the five if he had been offered a job and bolling gave a nonanswer  
bolling has been with fox news since  where he is the cohost of the five and hosts the weekend show cashin in  before then he had been an analyst on cnbc and a new york mercantile exchange nymex trader bolling has been an ardent supporter of trump from the getgo to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas  
laura ingraham according to cnn money  ingraham is being heavily considered for president trumps press secretary here is what ingraham has said on the matter 
i am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs so well see what happens ingraham said on fox news 
she cautioned i think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative but she strongly suggested that some sort of trump administration post is in the works 
its a big decision but im at the point where if my country needs me and if i can do something to actually you know advance the trump agenda which is stuff i have written about now for  years with trade immigration and just renewing america then i obviously have to seriously consider that she told foxs tucker carlson 
like bolling ingraham who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since   has also been an early supporter of trump going as far as saying that nevertrump conservatives support partial birth abortion and her website lifezette attacked conservatives like ben shapiro for opposing the altright as usual shapiro punched back hard  
jeanine pirro pirro accompanied by rudy giuliani was seen headed inside trump tower which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the trump administration according to page six  what that job would be is not known 
pirro also has been an early trump supporter and she has claimed to have known him for  years  pirros exhusband al pirro has been described as a man donald trump keeps on retainer as a realestate lawyer and trump once donated  to pirro when she ran for new york state attorney general

for some people fishing is a long boring day of sitting and staring endlessly at a rod and reel that may never get a bite but what if you could get down with those mocking waterbreathers and have highnoon shootout with them the way nature intended 
well thats just what some florida boys thought when they decided to take their modified glock mm pistol into the gulf of mexico to help deal with the infestation of lionfish 
thesickest provides some more details on the lionfish overpopulation problem and the boys creative way to address it 
lionfish are an invasive species with no natural predators whos females lay a staggering two million eggs a year the intersection between ammunitionhappy americans and the determent of an overpopulated species is where the the use of this new sporting phenomenon was birthed 
lionsfish were never intended to be in the gulf of mexico and while its speculated that their transplant may be linked to a hurricanes back in the s because of their rapid reproductive nature the waters have become flooded by their presence 
a single lionsfish consumes  reefs edible baitfish within five weeks of arriving on that reef  incredibly damaging to plant that is the cornerstone of the underwater ecosystem the issue has gotten to a point where entering the florida coast at any time can mean running across thousands of lionsfish just posted up chilling 
the good news is that the introduction of the gun has the potential of bringing hunters and otherwise uninterested fishers to the gulf for a fun filled time of shooting underwater an activity that actually looks like a blast 
the video below shows just how fun it can be

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-10-27T19:01:11.700+03:00,clinton policy on syria would lead to ww iii trump,"clintons nofly zone over syria will lead to war with russia warning of jcs chairman general dunford october   at  am global research  october   the media has failed to address the confrontation between the us state department and the joint chiefs of staff 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford image right has warned both the us senate as well secretary of state john kerry in no uncertain terms that a no fly zone over syria would lead to war with both syria and russia intimating a dangerous process of military escalation 
in a senate arms services committee hearing dunford said responding to questions from republican senator roger whicker mississippi 
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
at the third presidential debate hillary clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president she would implement a noflyzone intimating that the objective was to save lives 
i think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general clinton said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator chris wallace 
this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the russians and syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground  i think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in syria fox news emphasis added 
at present under the obama administration the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the no fly zone 
the joint chiefs of staff are appointed by the secretary of defense 
under a clinton presidency a new secretary of defense as well as a new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff firmly committed to a no fly zone over syria would be appointed 
michèle angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is hillarys choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option 
according to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under hillary clinton said she would direct us troops to push president bashar alassads forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region 
confirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces 
according to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the obama administration has been willing to commit
since russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington 
flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone 
the press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general dunford and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything
senator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing 
what is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage 
secretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything 
senator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone  
secretary carter well okay 
senator wicker  but described in more palatable terms 
secretary carter there are  a number of different proposals have been made but i  the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me 
senator wicker im speaking about a  
secretary carter but i think thats what a  but  its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing 
let me ask the chairman if he has anything to add 
general dunford senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility  we the joint force has a responsibility  to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president 
senator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped 
general dunford all options  
senator wicker what do you think of that option sir 
general dunford right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make 

concluding remarks 
from the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation 
it is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the obama administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january  
consequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country 
the footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-10-27T19:13:31.635+03:00,dr duke and dr macdonald call for prosecution of hillary for treasonous support of isis,"how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday october   at  am 
how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday 
by dr patrick slattery  there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections trump talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks hillary if she will accept the will of the voters 
of course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals 
but one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans 
what people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected 
it is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president biden before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes that elected president bush ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which bush won over gore amidst the greatest of controversy 
so if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty 
unless hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week a trump victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has trump losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected 
notice i did not say trump would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for trump do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed trump delegates to the republican national convention deserting trump and voting for cruz it was only that trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the never trump people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention 
so who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions 
as a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination 
the point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself 
so how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray trump such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president 
it is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count 
the nightmare situation would be after a close election the hillary people or the never trump people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like trump anyway not to vote for trump they could vote for hillary they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting 
then what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for hillary in the above  scenario it would only require two then hillary gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for trump for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january 
however not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if hillary cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing hillary 
but what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny trump the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible 
while none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat trump and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for trump the media could start inventing more reasons why trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case 
it would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated",english,davidduke.com,https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg,hate,dr duke dr macdonald call prosecution hillary treasonous support isis,could steal election trump even announced winner next tuesday

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-11-03T21:10:52.388+02:00,after debate duke says usa becoming banana republic,"david brooks whites are voting their gene pool after being ruined by globalization immigration and feminism november   at  am by dr patrick slattery 
on the pbs news hour on friday david brooks said white people are voting their gene pool wow just wow this is the same david brooks who wrote in his new york times column about a jewish woman who came up to him after a speech and knowing that he was jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how jews had taken over america which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the caseone of my jewish professors once boasted that jews earn like episcopalians but vote like puerto ricans in other words they voted their gene pool of course they eventually bought out the republican party as well which gave their gene pools vote a choice
blacks famously vote their gene pool hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool but when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting it is something that brooks and the rest of the zio elite and their goyish lackey find deplorable 
basically less educated or high schooleducated whites are going to trump it doesnt matter what the guy does and collegeeducated going to clinton 
sometimes you get the sense that the campaign barely matters people are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is and that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me 
but what brooks said about the reasons for whites besides the collegeindoctrinated whites voting their gene pool was even more interesting 
we had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for america i think globalization has been really good for america i think the influx of immigrants has been really good for america feminism has been really good for america 
but there are a lot of people who used to be up in society because of those three good things are now down a lot of high schooleducated white guys and they have been displaced 
when david brooks was growing up whites make up close to  of the american population so it doesnt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the american population is good for america 
of course he did specify high schooleducated white guys well were blacks helped by globalization immigration and feminism what did that do for their employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc 
and white women well maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair nose rings tattoos and raise cats instead of babies i guess we never asked them 
and college educated white guys well they used to go to harvard and yale now with affirmative action for blacks and hispanics competition from asians and massive jewish nepotism a white guy is lucky to get into a secondtier state school

dr david duke offers a new paradigm for humanity read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of human rights a recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its human diversity independence and freedom the right of every people to preserve its culture traditions art forms and characteristics of society 
a path to peace and harmonious nations and societies why we must resist globalist destruction of freedom globalist forms of economic and financial slavery and globalist zionist wars 
in the power of its reason love and understanding this declaration of human diversity and freedom can be the moral engine to saving our european heritage and truly the rights of every people on earth the foundation of human freedom 
i believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of human diversity i cherish not only the value of every form of life on earth in what we call biodiversity but also respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent 
human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself 
not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale 
much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural 
human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth 
we believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind 
we believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom 
we believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit 
for example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence 
nations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions 
we also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society 
if one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite 
it is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this 
we believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all 
instead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony 
we believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people 
and this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states 
look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration 
a world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom 
a multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord 
just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity 
every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity 
united nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings 
this urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict 
in fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression 
nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide 
the global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression  
they attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide 
better to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect 
it is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts 
it is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity 
we must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity 
we support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity 
as a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity 
this is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened 
but still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals 
i believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine 
i realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself 
there is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself 
but it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all 
in that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity 
nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony 
it is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast 
group differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents 
although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony 
and just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots 
this is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression 
autonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric 
nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people 
even european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by  years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning 
when the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic 
they did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity 
contrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict 
how much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity 
so even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale 
ironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values 
and in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities 
there are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants 
but nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population 
this process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority 
a powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics 
the most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions 
the political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed 
on the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit 
it is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism 
the globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth 
they seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills 
they want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt 
they want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation 
and these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people 
they grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism 
globalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history yes to freedom yes to diversity and independence 
but my dear friends all over the world in my homeland of america and that of my brethren in europe but among all freedom loving people across the globe millions of us say no to globalism 
we say yes to freedom yes to human diversity and independence 
we say no to globalist wars such as the iraq war the afghanistan war the planned war on iran horrific wars that are part of the zionist globalist agenda 
we say no to the zionist dominated globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars 
we say yes to a free internet and the freedom of people create their own media literature music and art forms no longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the globalist elite 
we say no to globalism yes to human freedom yes to human diversity yes to world of peace and prosperity 
we say yes to every peoples striving to preserve their way of life their particular heritage their particular expression of humanity 
whether we are kurds or pakistanis or iranians or palestinians whether we are chinese or japanese or africans or indians or of european heritage we say no to globalism 
we say yes to human freedom and global diversity we say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny 
we say no to the global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power we say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth 
we are humanity we are many 
because we honor our own heritage and traditions we honor every heritage and tradition 
because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on earth 
because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s 
just as most europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures we refuse to support the globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world 
because we love peace we refuse to support their zionistdriven globalist wars a new paradigm of human rights 
this is a new affirmation of human rights a new paradigm it is the human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom 
it is found where people yearn for human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in nature 
the globalists have global economic media political and military power but we represent the true desires of humanity for freedom 
we represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions human diversity freedom and independence 
we must resist rule of the globalists over us with a global coalition of mutually free peoples 
we are rising in every nation 
our paradigm for human freedom and diversity is growing among people all over the world 
the globalists cannot rule over us without our consent they cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of human freedom and diversity not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all mankind good for all people on this planet 
the principles we stand for we hold for our own people and for every people on the face the earth 
this is the world i am committed to the humanity i am committed to the nation in my own land that i am committed to 
i hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for humanity a new commitment to human freedom and diversity

rev dankof quoted an article by former reagan administration assistant treasury secretary paul craig roberts that goes farther than he has ever done before in identifying the jewish nature of the power establishment in america the very same establishment that is fighting presidentelect trump tooth and nail there seems to be the start of a sea change in which people are becoming more willing to point out that the emperor has no clothes

trump appoints men who will take america back 
presidentelect donald trumps appointment of bannon flynn and sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking america back 
trump chief strategist bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on white people on his breitbart website 
national security head flynn realizes that americas foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical jihadists of saudi arabia over our natural allies the christian muslim and moderate secularists of syria he also understands that putin of christian russia should not be our enemy but our ally he is an avowed enemy of the jewish warmonger traitors called neocons and they in turn intensely hate this us army general who truly puts america first 
attorney general sessions has been hated for years by the jewishdominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into america and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action 
during his us senate confirmation hearings senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of equal rights and opportunity when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created america 
we must demand the protection of the civil rights of all americans including white people everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive antiwhite affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations federal state and city governments colleges and educational institutions

Dr. Patrick Slattery,2016-11-17T07:12:32.712+02:00,dr duke and pastor dankof quote jews boasting of jewish media power," views share by dr david duke when i was first began to understand the ultraracist supremacist ideology of judaism and zionism i came into contact with the theory that presentday jews are genetically unrelated to the historical jewish community the allegation known as the khazar theory claims that the ashkenazim jews of today are actually the descendants of the khazar people a central asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to judaism in the th century ad it is claimed that these newlyminted jews then migrated into what is now russia eastern europe and later western and northern europe the theory is also used to advance the idea that jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the khazar people adopted the talmudic values of shephardic and other jews who were unrelated to them interestingly enough the khazar theory was launched and is still to this day driven primarily by communist jews and other jews who promote it in the gentile community as a refutation that the jews cant be racist because they are not a race it is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that the jews are not a race all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as jewish above left to right zionist extremist and communist party member arthur koestler author of the the thirteenth tribe jewish geneticist eran elhaik and shlomo sand an israeli academic and former member of the union of israeli communist youth banki all three maintain that large numbers of presentday jews are completely genetically unrelated to the middle easternorigin jews who wrote the babylonian talmud 
for years i accepted the khazar theory as true after it all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading jewish role in communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements it was only later when i considered the question logically and scientifically were my doubts about the khazar theory aroused one thing that i did not know then was that koestler the communist jew who popularized the khazar theory bragged in a jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against antisemitism his theory was that since the gospels and europeans blamed jews for the crucifixion of jesus christ if he could make europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the christkiller jews talked about in the new testament that he could lessen hatred against jews one must remember until the jewish triumph of christian zionism  percent of christianity viewed jews as the greatest enemies of jesus christ and god as the new testament makes very very clear so in those days some jews such as koestler saw an advantage to say that the jews were not actually related to the jews who crucified christ and so persecuted christians koestlers official biography written by michael scammell specifically quotes him on why he wrote the thirteenth tribe  his argument was that if he could persuade people that a nonjewish khazar heritage formed the basis of modern jews then this would be a weapon against european raciallybased antisemitism should this theory be confirmed the term antisemitism would become void of meaning he said according to scammell koestler told french biologist pierre debrayritzen he was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of eastern european jews were descended from the khazars the racial basis for antisemitism would be removed and antisemitism itself could disappear source scammell michael koestler the literary and political odyssey of a twentiethcentury skeptic random house  isbn  p  in the s the khazar theory was also promoted by benjamin friedman a prominent rich jew who converted to christianity and turned against the jews it was certainly selfserving for him to promote the idea that jewishness was mostly cultural and religious and not racial in nature therefore facilitating more acceptance of him there are three fundamental issues which need to addressed the scientific evidence thehistoricallogical evidence and the reasons why the khazar theory came about part i the scientific evidencetwelve dna studies which disprove the khazar theory  a  study titled jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations share a common pool of ychromosome biallelic haplotypes  mf hammer etal proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that despite their longterm residence in different countries and isolation from one another most jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level admixture estimates suggested low levels of european ychromosome gene flow into ashkenazi and roman jewish communities    jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations were not statistically different the results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of jewish communities from europe north africa and the middle east descended from a common middle eastern ancestral population and suggest that most jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring nonjewish communities during and after the diaspora  a november  study titled the y chromosome pool of jews as part of the genetic landscape of the middle east  almut nebel et al american journal of human genetics nov     found that in most jewish populations male line ancestors appear to have been mainly middle eastern the study found that ashkenazi jews in particular share more common paternal lineages with other jewish and middle eastern groups than with nonjewish populations in areas where jews lived in eastern europe germany and the french rhine valley this is consistent with jewish traditions in placing most jewish paternal origins in the region of the middle east  a september  study titled european population substructure clustering of northern and southern populations  michael f seldin etal plos genetics doi journalpgen  found that both ashkenazi jews as well as sephardic jews showed more than  membership in the southern european group which made their results consistent with a later mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups  an april  study titled counting the founders the matrilineal genetic ancestry of the jewish diaspora  doron m behar etal plos one   e doi journalpone  found that about  of ashkenazi jews originate maternally from just four female founders who were of middle eastern origin  a january  study titled a genomewide genetic signature of jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full jewish ancestry in a large random sample of european americans  anna c need etal genome biology   r doi gbr  found that individuals with full jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no jewish ancestry this study showed that in dna terms jews both sephardic and ashkenazim cluster as a distinct groupsomething that if the khazar theory was true would be impossible  a december  study titled genomic microsatellites identify shared jewish ancestry intermediate between middle eastern and european populations  naama m kopelman etal bmc genetics    doi   found that  jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure these results support the view that the jewish populations largely share a common middle eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with nonjewish populations of european descent  a december  study titled the genomewide structure of the jewish people  doron m behar et al nature    july  doinature  analyzed individuals from  jewish diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genomewide diversity with those from  old world nonjewish populations in order to provide comprehensive comparisons between jewish and nonjewish populations in the diaspora as well as with nonjewish populations from the middle east and north africa the results identified a previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the middle east and that most jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster and that traces the origins of most jewish diaspora communities to the levant  a june  study titled abrahams children in the genome era major jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared middle eastern ancestry  atzmon et al american journal of human genetics   refuted the idea of largescale genetic contributions of central and eastern european and slavic populations to the formation of ashkenazi jewry this study found used genomewide analysis of seven jewish groups iranian iraqi syrian italian turkish greek and ashkenazi and demonstrated distinctive jewish population clusters each with shared middle eastern ancestry proximity to contemporary middle eastern populations and variable degrees of european and north african admixture this paper specifically excluded the khazar theory as an origin for presentday jews saying the genetic proximity    is incompatible with theories that ashkenazi jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted khazars or slavs  a march  study by steven m bray et al titled signatures of founder effects admixture and selection in the ashkenazi jewish population  proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that the ashkenazi jewish aj population    has a common middle eastern origin with other jewish diaspora populations while concluding that the ashkenazi jewish population has had the most european admixture  a march  study by christopher l campbell et al titled north african jewish and nonjewish populations form distinctive orthogonal clusters  proceedings of the us national academy of sciences doi pnas  found that genomewide analysis of five north african jewish groups moroccan algerian tunisian djerban and libyan demonstrated distinctive north african jewish population clusters with proximity to other jewish populations furthermore the study showed the sephardic jewish genome is compatible with the history of north african jewsfounding during classical antiquity with proselytism of local populations

pathology and genetics at albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university and director of genetic and genomic testing at montefiore medical center medicine concluded that jews exhibit a distinctive genetic signature  jews are a race genes revealauthor uncovers dna links between members of tribe the jewish daily forward may    ostrer who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at montefiore medical center said in his conclusion that jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race ostrer also deals specifically with the khazar theory he pointed out that the findings from the jewish hapmap project see below completely refute the theories that ashkenazi jews are the descendants of converted khazars or slavs  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post    the jewish hapmap project  a joint project of albert einstein college of medicine and new york university school of medicine was created to understand the structure of the genomes in jewish populations and is an outgrowth of the human hapmap project according to this project jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic cultural and religious traditions over  years despite residence all over the world its findings based on first hand dna studies amongst jewish populations around the globe found no evidence to support a central asian dna origin for jewry according to the jerusalem post the jewish hapmap project in new york city has so far shown in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century jewish populations from the major jewish diaspora groups  ashkenazi sephardic and mizrahi  form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to semitic and european populations within this larger jewish cluster each of the jewish populations formed its own subcluster a high degree of mixing of ashkenazi sephardi italian and syrian jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to middle eastern iraqi and iranian jews this genetic split seemed to have occurred about  years ago  jews a religious group people or race jerusalem post   dna studies find that ashkenazim jews have  european admixture both the behar study section  above and the atzmon study section  above were commented upon by the british former deputy editor of the journal nature  and currently the scientific correspondent for the n ew york times  nicholas wade in an article in that newspaper as follows jewish communities in europe and the middle east share many genes inherited from the ancestral jewish population that lived in the middle east some  years ago even though each community also carries genes from other sources  usually the country in which it lives adding that a major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two jewish communities of europe the ashkenazim and the sephardim wade pointed out that the two studies refute the suggestion made by the historian shlomo sand in his book the invention of the jewish people that jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in europe and central asia who converted to judaism at various times jewish communities from europe the middle east and the caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the levant ethiopian jews and two judaic communities in india are genetically much closer to their host populations wade wrote the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population which is about  times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of new york city ashkenazic and sephardic jews have roughly  percent european ancestry with most of the rest from the middle east the two surveys find the two communities seem very similar to each other genetically which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long  studies show jews genetic similarity nicholas wade new york times june    eran elhaiks single study attempts to refute the mass of earlier dna evidence the mass of dna and genetic evidence is therefore overwhelmingly indicative that despite a certain amount of european admixture among ashkenazim jewry there is still a clearly definable middle eastern genetic component to both ashkenazim and sephardic jewry despite all of these studiesand many more too numerous to list individually herein december  a single individual by the name of eran elhaik from the johns hopkins university school of medicine attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence his paper titled the missing link of jewish european ancestry contrasting the rhineland and the khazarian hypotheses was published in the journal genome biological evolution    doi gbeevs  in a nutshell elhaikwhose rather obviously jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common jewish type how else can many jews be physically recognized as jewsargues that his method of doing comparative studies between presentday central asian populations ashkenazim jews and nonjewish test groups proves that ashkenazim jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins with a strong link to what he identifies as the khazar tribe even though elhaiks work is the only single paper as opposed to literally dozens of opposing dna studies written by a single jewish individual as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe jewish and nonjewish alike it has quickly become the mostquoted proof of the khazar theory critical errors in elhaiks paper elhaiks paper has a number of errors some small and a number of major ones but they are all serious because even the small errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation for example his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the khazarsyet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups the mbuti and biaka pygmies these two groups elhaik asserts at least twice are to be found in south africa actually the mbuti and biaka pygmies are nowhere near south africa and are only to be found literally half a continent away in the congo while this may seem a small error it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper this sloppiness is again repeated when elhaik asserts that eastern and central european jews account for approximately  of over  million worldwide jews in reality the figure is far less of the estimated  million jews worldwide  million are ashkenazim and  million are sephardic a division of  european jews to  noneuropean jews and it should be pointed out that the zionist state of israel actually has a sephardic and mizrahi nonashkenazi jewish majority among jews these actual facts on jewish ethnicity are readily available and elhaiks motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion namely that most jews are not middle eastern in origin and that jews are not race or a genetically similar people the most important error in elhaiks paper however is actually openly admitted namely that there is actually no khazar dna in existence against wh
ich any sort of measurement can be taken elhaik himself admits this in his paper the khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced   in other words there is no record of what exactly khazar dna might have been as there is no record of what khazar dna isit is ipso facto physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls surrogate populationsin this case contemporary middle eastern and caucasus populations anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the caucasus in particular will immediately see that elhaiks assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of  years ago is highly problematic and quite simply unsustainable the caucasus a region at the border of europe and asia situated between the black and the caspian seas has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last  years ranging from indoeuropeans semites mongols and othersand is today highly genetically diverse a claim that dna samples from this region can be taken as any sort of dna yardstick is dubious to say the very least finally elhaiks methodology in comparing the dna samples is to make an understatement unique to him as marcus feldman director of stanford universitys morrison institute for population and resource studies said he elhaik appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data  jews a race genetic theory comes under fierce attack by dna expert the jewish daily forward may    interestingly the study which was cited in the new york times of the jews as a race is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by german national socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the united states and elsewhere also many of the presentday extensive studies have been carried out by both gentile and jewish geneticists alike obviating any claims of racial bias elhaiks theory is completely refuted by the new most massive and most complete study ever done of the jewish genome one of elhaiks arguments was that the previous studies referenced above were done in the pregenomewide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populationsimplying that their results are not in line with the most modern dna sequencing methodology in fact at least one studywhich appeared after elhaiks work was first publishedhas confirmed the accuracy of the original studies and also completely refuted elhaiks hypothesis titled no evidence from genomewide data of a khazar origin for the ashkenazi jews this study was published by the journal human biology in august  behar doron m etal human biology access preprints paper   this paper emphasized the serious error with elhaiks work because the khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to ashkenazi jewish ancestry the khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics furthermore because only limited genetic data have been available from the caucasus region and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the middle east the attribution of any signal of ashkenazicaucasus genetic similarity to khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral middle eastern ancestry has been problematic this latest most massive study of the jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists both gentile and jewish to analyze jewish genetics researchers from laboratories around the globe including estonia russia italy greece bosnia and herzegovina croatia armenia the us and israel gathered together the largest jewish dna data set ever yet assembled the paper explained as follows here through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of ashkenazi jewish genetic origins employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure we find that ashkenazi jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other jewish populations and among nonjewish populations with groups from europe and the middle east no particular similarity of ashkenazi jews with populations from the caucasus is evident particularly with the populations that most closely represent the khazar region thus analysis of ashkenazi jews together with a large sample from the region of the khazar khaganate corroborates the earlier results that ashkenazi jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the middle east and europe that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other jewish populations and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the caucasus region the latest most uptodate and modern dna analysis has therefore completely refuted the khazar theory it is important to understand that this refutation has come from nonjewish and jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world and cannot be ascribed to a conspiracy part ii the historicallogical evidence the historical record shows jewish physical consistency one of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance european people broadly resemble each other african people broadly resemble each other chinese people broadly resemble each other australian aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on it is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other jews are no different in this regard to any other people they too show a resemblance to each otherthis is why it is possible to often recognize a jewish person by his physical appearance a good example in point is the already mentioned jewish geneticist eran elhaik who despite physically embodying a jewish sterrotype recognized around the world tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst jews the khazar theory holds that most ashkenazim jews are not semitic but are central asian converts to judaism proponents of the khazar theory fail to understand the logical consequence of their beliefnamely that a supposed central asian origin of most ashkenazim jews means that they will not physically resemble other jews as anyone can see this is not the case sephardic jews are on average slightly darker than ashkenazim jews but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such above these two illustrations make the point even more dramatically on the left the ashkenazim jewess barbara streisand new york  on the right a jewish leader of israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the th dynasty  bc tomb of sobekhotep thutmose iv egypt two thousand years before the alleged khazar conversion and they look the same as modern ashkenazi jews streisands paternal grandparents came from galicia polandukraine and her maternal grandparents came from russiaif anyone would be khazar according to that theory it would be her nonetheless she closely resembles the only designated jew as portrayed on an egyptian tomb from  years ago the leader of a jewish trade delegation to egypt the genetic continuity is clearand if the khazar theory was true there would be no physical similarity because there would have been a racial sea change in jewish appearance left the famous banker of pompeii jucundus who lived circa  ad  years before the alleged ashkenazi conversion identified as a jew by the german anthropologist hans fk günther in his book  racial elements of european history fig a and b chapter viii  alongside the ashkenazi jew abe foxman of the adl the similarity between jucundus and foxman is clear and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the jewish type over centuriessomething that would be impossible if the khazar theory was true in addition to genetic studies there have been extensive physiological comparison of jewish remains from burial sites from ancient israel and presentday ashkenazi and sephardic physiology all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the sephardic and ashkenazi spectrumand their difference from european populations jewish supremacist behavior through the millennia disprove the khazar theory another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the khazar theory is that jewish supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millenniafrom biblical times right through to the present day most christians are aware of the behavior of the old testament jewswho burn rampage kill rape and enslave their way through palestine supposedly on order of their tribal god they are aware of the fact that the gospels of the new testament show that elite of the jews the pharisees were the biggest enemies of christ and arranged for his crucifixion and the new testament is clear that they led the persecution of christians which has continued through both jewish bolshevism and the cultural assault in the zio global media it must also be clear that the talmud the books of jewish law promoting jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all nonjews was written hundreds of years before any alleged khazar conversion while it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events there is no question about jewish interaction with gentilesand romans in particularduring the first century ad the worlds first antijewish riots broke out in the city of alexandria in  ad and reoccurred in  ad  ad  ad and  ad in that year the archbishop of alexandria cyril ordered the expulsion of all jews from the city the roman historian socrates of constantinople not be confused with the socrates of classical greece in his ecclesiastical history recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of jews from a nonjewish city in detail and reveals behavior by jewish supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today over  years later   the jews were continually factious and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the christians    cyril on being informed of this sent for the principal jews and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the christians these menaces instead of suppressing their violence only rendered the jewish populace more furious and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the christians one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from alexandria socrates hist eccl vii  pc lxxxii  ff the very first jewish community outside of the middle east was established in rome in  bcand it was not long before their activities roused roman public opinion against them the famous orator cicero among others frequently spoke against the presence of jews during sittings of the roman senate in his famous pro flacco oration which dealt with the case of a roman aristocrat lucius valerius flaccus accused of unlawfully confiscating jewish money cicero said now let us take a look at the jews and their mania for gold you chose this site chief prosecutor laelius and the crowd which frequents it with an eye to this particular accusation knowing very well that jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting many other prominent and famous romans such as seneca juneval and tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of jews within the roman empire the roman historian tacitus in his most famous work histories described the activities of the jews as follows in order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind among the jews all things are profane that we hold sacred on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral    the other practices of the jews are sinister and revolting and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and freewill offerings to swell the jewish exchequer and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother jews but the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies they will not feed or intermarry with gentiles though a most lascivious people the jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race among themselves nothing is barred they have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others tacitus histories  the famous british historian edward gibbon in his monumental work the decline and fall of the roman empire lippincourt philadelphia  vol  page  discussed jewish supremacist behavior in roman times this way from the reign of nero to that of antoninus pius the jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of egypt of cyria and of cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the roman government but of all human kind antijewish literature during roman times was very widespread one work by the greek apion was so wellknown that the romanized jewish historian josephus who wrote the famous account of the jewish uprising of  ad called the jewish wars wrote an entire book trying to refute apions arguments the roman emperor tiberius formally expelled the jews from rome in  ad they returned shortly thereafter only to be expelled once again in  ad in  ad emperor trajan ordered that all jews in mesopotamia should be killed saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region one of the most famous emperors of the eastern roman empire justinian  ad adopted a comprehensive antijewish policy which barred jews from the civil service military posts and any other positions of influence in his government all of these events predate the supposed khazar conversion by centuriesyet it can be seen that the identical behavioral patterns are on display before and after the supposed khazar infusion logic dictates that if the racial makeup of jews changed substantially after the year  ad then their beh",,,,,,,,

today dr duke had pastor mark dankof as his guest for the hour they talked about donald trumps appointments to his new cabinet they gave low marks to representative mike pompeo as the new cia director for his past policy positions although they noted his loyalty to trump as a potential silver lining they also panned nikki hailey as the un ambassador which however does allow trump supporter henry mcmaster succeed her as south carolina governor 
the most hopeful prospect is congresswoman tulsi gabbard from hawaii who is a potential secretary of state she has supported trumps desire to reconcile with russia and has been the most vocal opponent in congress of the obama administrations efforts to overthrow syrian president assad her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of american foreign policy from jewish neocons and putting americas interests first again

tulsi gabbard for secretary of state an example of the need for political realignment 
by dr patrick slattery  on monday donald trump met with hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard she has been mentioned as a possible secretary of state or even secretary of defense she is an iraq war combat veteran and major in the hawaii national guard its not just that she would be preferable in these jobs to john bolton rudi giuliani or mitt romney but is probably the very best candidate from the ranks of the washington establishment 
in particular she is unique in being a strong and principled opponent of any intervention in syria she wants the united states to stop supporting isis and other rebel groups and let the russians iranians and hezbollah help president assad defeat the jihadists and end the syrian civil war which is more an armed invasion than a real civil war this is exactly the right approach 
and its not just that she is on the right side of this issue it is her signature issue she is on the armed services and foreign affairs committees so this is what she has spent her time on 
its not that shes perfect it has been noted that she at the very least pays lipservice to israel everyone on capital hill does lets face it zionism is the established religion in america and there is a religious test for office but her fault goes further than that she condemned the government of thenukrainian president victor yanukovich in february  just as hillary clintons erstwhile secretary of state victoria nuland was organizing his overthrow gabbard like everyone else in congress then supported arming the jewishdominated government that nuland put in place in kiev 
even so her congressional website does not carry any mention of ukraine since  and her vocal opposition to starting world war iii with russia over syria seems to indicate that her view towards russia have become more realistic this as has been noted elsewhere is in line with trumps view 
but there is one more significant benefit of appointing gabbard as secretary of state it could help trigger a badly needed realignment of american politics as people like ralph nader have long been telling us there is no significant difference between democrats and republicans that is because the most divisive issues in politics are not the existential issues that face our society and the world 
if there has been one litmus test in politics during my lifetime it has been abortion it may engender strong emotions but it hardly ranks with nuclear war as a threat to humanity yet i cannot tell you how many staunchly antiwar people in  voted for prowar democrat john kerry because they were worried about bush appointing prolife judges to the supreme court talk about getting your priorities backwards 
this year despite senior statesmen like mikhail gorbachev warning us that the threat of a nuclear world war iii has never been higher foreign policy was all but absent from the campaign only nonmainstream elements like the paleoconservatives the altright greens and stray individuals from the old left like stephen f cohen managed to finally get it injected into the campaign just in the nick of time in such a close election one could certainly make the case that this made the difference 
at this point in time war has to be the top priority as important as immigration may be what difference will it make in a postapocalyptic mad max world of course if we could organize around opposing jewish power it would take care of war but far too few people are awake enough to make this possible in fact israel currently has no role as an organizing feature in americas political alignment as both parties so unanimously support it blindly but as the realignment proceeds along an america first noninterventionist foreign policy an america first immigration policy is a natural outcome 
if trump embraces gabbard and rejects the neocons and their goy toys like mitt romney it would really help clarify the sides in this struggle party labels mean nothing romney and ryan and the like already revealed themselves by opposing trump there are tons of people outside of the republican party who could conceivably rally around trumps foreign and other policies and it is imperative that the donald make a point of bringing in some of these people into high profile positions while visibly snubbing his true enemies from within the republican party",ignore,davidduke.com,http://davidduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CNNmeme-01.jpg,hate,dr duke pastor dankof trumps america first foreign policy,september new homes sales rise back level david stockman posted wednesday october th david stockmans contra corner place mainstream delusions cant warfare state bailout state bubble finance beltway banditry ripped refuted rebuked subscribe receive david stockmans latest posts email day well model portfolio lee adlers daily data dive davids personally curated insights analysis leading contrarian thinkers,1,Real

swedish democrat party member of parliament anna hagwall has announced her resignation from all party posts and will not stand for reelection in  after a furor following her exposure of the fact that a single family of jews control the swedish media one jewish family helps to brainwash the entire population of sweden this swedish mp has had enough 
the uproar followed her letter to the aftonbladet newspaper in which she said that ethnicity should be a factor in determining media ownership of more than  percentan obvious reference to the jewish bonnier family media group 
the bonnier group owns  book publishers  business and trade press newspapers  digital news platforms  film production companies  magazines  major newspapers  tv stations and  other media outletsand quite literally dominates the controlled media in sweden 
hagwall had earlier submitted a motion to the swedish parliament which proposed cuts to the state subsidies paid to media in sweden 
although she never mentioned jews by name hagwall said in an explanatory letter to the aftonbladet that it would be a good idea to let bonniers newspapers go under so that no family ethnic group or company could control more than  percent of the media 
an entire  percent of the media is owned and controlled by the same owners hagwell wrote this is not acceptable therefore media ownership should be spread over many independent companies and people in order to change this i suggest press subsidies only for the independent media 
when asked by aftonbladet how the abolition of press subsidies to the countrys local newspapers reduce bonniers power over the media in sweden hagwall answered by email that most small newspapers are directly or indirectly controlled by bonnier and why they have to be subsidized by the swedish taxpayer is a mystery 
let the little bonnier newspapers in the provinces go under because then a void will be created which can be filled by newspapers that care about people and business owners 
she also said that the swedish public service broadcaster sveriges television svt should be switched to pay channels to reduce svts propagation of the politically correct agenda 
the comments provoked a stream of attacks upon hagwall and the swedish democrat leadership also distanced itself from her saying in a statement that the matter will affect her future in the party 
this week hagwall resigned her position as member of the parliamentary committee on taxation and internal group leader of the sweden democrats tax policy group she also will not seek reelection to parliament in  at the request of the party leadership and it is currently unclear if she will continue to sit in parliament for the remainder of the current term",english,dailywire.com,http://www.dailywire.com/sites/default/files/styles/169large/public/uploads/2016/11/pistol_water.jpg?itok=-fV37gkH,bias,video underwater handgun takes fishing next level fun daily wire,writers swedish democrat party member parliament anna hagwall announced resignation party posts stand reelection furor following exposure fact single family jews control swedish media one jewish family helps brainwash entire population sweden swedish mp enough uproar followed letter aftonbladet newspaper said ethnicity factor determining media ownership percentan obvious reference jewish bonnier family media group bonnier group owns book publishers business trade press newspapers digital news platforms film production companies magazines major newspapers tv stations media outletsand quite literally dominates controlled media sweden hagwall earlier submitted motion swedish parliament proposed cuts state subsidies paid media sweden although never mentioned jews name hagwall said explanatory letter aftonbladet would good idea let bonniers newspapers go family ethnic group company could control percent media entire percent media owned controlled owners hagwell wrote acceptable therefore media ownership spread many independent companies people order change suggest press subsidies independent media asked aftonbladet abolition press subsidies countrys local newspapers reduce bonniers power media sweden hagwall answered email small newspapers directly indirectly controlled bonnier subsidized swedish taxpayer mystery let little bonnier newspapers provinces go void created filled newspapers care people business owners also said swedish public service broadcaster sveriges television svt switched pay channels reduce svts propagation politically correct agenda comments provoked stream attacks upon hagwall swedish democrat leadership also distanced saying statement matter affect future party week hagwall resigned position member parliamentary committee taxation internal group leader sweden democrats tax policy group also seek reelection parliament request party leadership currently unclear continue sit parliament remainder current term,1,Real

even though early polling shows there hasnt been an impact in swing states  and even though the majority of americans have already made up their minds each time her emails are brought up hillary clinton falls in the polls 
a gallup poll showed that emails are the most americans have heard about clinton not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them  but the emails that she was already cleared on 
even though one result of the comey letter has been to energize clinton supporters  at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency this still isnt an acceptable practice 
republican fbi director james comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent obviously would impact an election that was then just  days out and is now  days out and actually bore no information well thats inaccurate the letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared but the damage has already been done 
while ron fournier and others suggested that democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by comey was just more partisan folly the truth is even more disturbing 
by even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan we are allowing the press to enable republicans to continue pretending there is no reality 
in reality no matter which side of the aisle you are on its a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election the reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties  for instance its obvious that the fbi is investigating the trump campaign for coordination with russia but we dont headline that because the fbi hasnt commented on that because 
to do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections 
so its really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan even as the trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule if the rule applies to donald trump it should apply to hillary clinton 
asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan 
we must stick to reality we must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable republicans to keep drinking the nofact koolaid 
the press did the republican smoke is a real fire thing all through president obamas terms at one point claiming he was implicated in benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a republican aide to read him said emails  and of course it turned out that the emails didnt say what the aide told the reporter but that was learned much later and as everyone knows a lie travels faster than the truth 
and now american voters in swing states who read papers will think the fbi is investigating clinton 
so comeys letter did damage hillary clinton even if she wins the election the letter damaged her and down ballot democrats 
the media never learns they take republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact every time they look like fools to those who know there was no there in the comey letter but the average voter doesnt live for political updates 
the irresponsible damage is done

in a conference call with reporters hillary clintons campaign manager said that fbi director comeys letter is backfiring and energizing clintons volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers 
clinton campaign chair john podesta called comeys letter long on innuendo short on facts podesta said the more information that comes out the more this seems overblown podesta went off on rep jason chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened podesta said that comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts 
podesta said theres no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing he said if all the media reports are true about the investigation having nothing to do with hillary clinton its hard to see how this amounts to anything 
hillary clintons campaign chair called on comey to provide answers to be public 
clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that the comey letter is motivating clinton volunteers and supporters 
based on the anecdotes i am hearing from out team on the ground this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election our volunteers are rallying around hillary they know what a fighter she is 
 
they are turning out not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote as early voting goes into full swing were not just seeing this in our offices on the ground but also in our online in the online space as well i think this is we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday i think that this has only increased the momentum that were feeling among our activists on the ground 
later mook suggested that the comey letter is helping the clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire it is likely that the comey letter will backfire on republicans and motivate democrats to get out and support their nominee 
an early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters hillary clinton may end up benefiting from comeys actions because the fbi director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her

donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn and theres a newly surfaced video via ryan grim at huffington post that shows the trump humiliation game in action 
in the video trump publicly sexualizes and shames the  miss universe winner from australia jennifer hawkins as revenge before he does it trump tells the audience get even with people if they screw you screw them back  times as hard i really believe that 
watch this newly surfaced  corporate speech here via huffington post major trigger warning if youve been there 
watching this you see the trump modus operandi in action this is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning trumps advances the harassment as revenge the sexual shaming 
trump sets the audience up for the roman gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you the sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come because he is going to screw jennifer hawkins in public when she realizes that because its public she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions 
trump says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory jennifer hawkins 
trump orders hawkins to the stage the audience cheers and jeers delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl its to be a public spanking so much fun 
first of all how beautiful is jennifer trump asks claiming ownership of jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking the message he can make or break her she better play nice 
warning shot this is about getting even 
trump tells the audience that he was mad at hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in sydney he tells the audience how mad he was and then says as shes crossing the stage shes my favorite miss universe so she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears 
but then he stabs her publicly for the first time but i think i like the new one better 
the audience loves it he is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl she reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport 
hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing trump playing along with his game because she has to but there will be no easy way out of this one it wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience she will have to pay 
i was actually going to get up and tell you that jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside but shes not very bright trump tells the audience signaling that hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for 
that wouldnt have been true but i would have said it anyway trump proudly tells the audience this is his alpha male routine except in real life the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl but in the mind of little men like trump this makes him a winner 
trump points out that hawkins is a big star now but he helped her make it and then dissed him he owns her she must comply or face his wrath hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him but trump pushes her away from the microphone this public shaming will be done from trumps pov only no need for hawkins to assert her personhoodthere will be no defense allowed because shes already guilty 
and you know what she came tonight she came  came she came she came trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at christmas he waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming and they do they get it hee heee so clever came knuckles dragging on the floor clever 
see so they have the same filthy minds in australia trump says 
trump grabs hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her just like he bragged about doing on the bush tape 
hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them the kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek she is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him and pretended to fawn over him as required but she will not cannot allow the kiss the repulsive kiss 
im telling this story as i imagine it to be from her point of view although she has refused to comment of course she refused to comment women are told they will be blackballed if they comment the world is full of men like trump and they stick together see roger ailes women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public especially if they said no in private 
i can only do this because i have lived it somewhat like this in public and i have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body 
from talking to so many women during this election i know that im not alone i know that many other women will watch this and know they will feel the creep of fear and revulsion the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest how dare hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce trump 
and other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it setting you up to be humiliated even more they will laugh about it and gossip about it which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like trump ironically if you give in youre not humiliated its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object 
its not just the unwanted kiss although that is disgusting and assault much like donald trump bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape its the public humiliation and denigration 
its the way the woman is forced in front of thousands of people to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge 
its the way she tries to make it okay to sweetsmooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
in fact this is shades of what trump did to hillary clinton in the stalking debate after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed

geoff garin of hart research tweeted from the field still early but i was in the field in two states last night and saw absolutely no impact from the reporting on the comey letter 
 geoff garin geoffgarin october   
it is still early but if this were the election shifting news that republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate the reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign it will be because republicans are coming back to trump 
there are few undecided voters in this election and even if all the republican base come home to trump it wont be enough for trump to win because he is losing where the presidential election is really held trump is getting crushed at the state level 
republicans have been trying to build hillary clintons emails into a story for years and they have failed at every turn 
hillary clinton led the election while under congressional investigation hillary clinton led the election while under fbi investigation hillary clinton is leading the election today the message that republicans and the media dont want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails and they dont care 
voters are smarter than republicans and the press give them credit for the hillary clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that clinton did anything wrong 
if the polls tighten a little this will be the best news in the world for hillary clinton and democrats because it will destroy any potential for democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls

Jason Easley,2016-10-27T01:34:56.745+03:00,three new polls shatter the myth that the presidential election is tightening,"share on twitter print this post 
the fbi is examining how a hillary clinton aide handled emails the examination has nothing to do with the democratic nominee her emails or her email server 
according to newsweeks kurt eichenwald the scandal is related to the process clinton aide huma abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read 
eichenwald reported because clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent abedin like many state department officials found the government network technology to be cumbersome and she had great trouble printing documents there investigative records show as a result she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified state department account to either her yahoo account or her account on clintons server and printed the emails from there it is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husbands campaign 
abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed clinton needed to see and when the secretary forwarded emails to her for printing abedin told the fbi she would often print these emails without reading them abedin printed a large number of emails this way in part because investigative records show other staff members considered her clintons gatekeeper and often sent abedin electronic communications they wanted the secretary to see 
the entire scandal is about how emails were printed it has nothing to do with how hillary clinton handled emails or classified information the investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for hillary clinton to read no wonder comey didnt provide more details in his letter to congress the details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the fbi 
there is no evidence that clintons aide committed a crime for the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal there must be evidence that abedin intended to leak classified information there remains zero evidence of criminal activity 
the fbi examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the  election  and comeys behavior is a disgrace to the us intelligence community 
the new information destroys republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat  republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat 
the emails wont change anything in  but they will give congressional republicans a reason to keep investigating hillary clinton in  and beyond in other words james comey is already delegitimizing

at a rally in golden co trump said 
i have real problems with ballots being sent does that make sense 
like people saying oh heres a ballot heres another ballot throw it away oh heres one i like well keep that one 
i have real problems so get your ballots in 
trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about hillary clintons emails 
donald trump appears to be losing his mind he also seems to think that accusing the us postal service and election officials of stealing the election for hillary clinton is going to motivate republicans to vote 
consider the contradiction in trumps message the republican nominee tells his supporters that the us postal service is throwing away ballots while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots 
if their ballots are going to be thrown away by usps why should republicans bother mailing their ballots in 
it is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense trumps inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why republicans on pace to lose this election

although this campaign season has been interesting to say the least there is something happening one never thought would occur after spending nearly eight years demonizing obstructing and criticizing every and anything about the president of the united states republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the democratic president whose approval rating and popularity are growing 
it is hypocritical to say the least and at some point a result of a toxic republican candidate for the presidency but for some gop candidates it is a very dangerous strategy if any republican believed president obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election 
the president is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of donald trump president obama is also reminding republicans that  donald trump is the endpoint of eight years of gop toxic hostility  it may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every republican who ever crossed him  but he is getting some wellplaced and wellwarranted shots at republicans 
two republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics so it likely stunned the president that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed opposed and attempted to get rid of 
ohio senator rob portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the president to break the grip of heroin addiction president obama took the time to excoriate portman for 
 finally withdrawing his support from donald trump  but only  after looking at the polling now that its politically expedient but he has supported him up until last week so i guess it was ok when trump was attacking minorities and suggesting that mexicans were rapists  and insulting gold star moms making fun of disabled americans i guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge why was that ok and now he says he will vote for the vicepresidential nominee instead except that guy still supports donald trump  
the president was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the president  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times california republican representative daryl issa is sending out campaign mailers with the presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with president obama  to protect victims of sexual assault  
daryl issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on issacreated scandals during a fundraiser in la jolla california sunday last the president assailed issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the presidents image on it the president said 
 issas primary contribution to the united states congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumpedup investigations that have led nowhere this is now a guy who because poll numbers are bad has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me now that is the definition of chutzpah 
as remarked by tim murphy at mother jones president obama is not just evening up the score with republicans who made his tenure miserable  he is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in republicans faces  
the president clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue republicans with he said  
 heres the thing for years republican politicians and the farright media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me about hillary about harry they said i wasnt born here they said climate change is a hoax they said that i was going to take everybodys guns away they said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law this is what theyve been saying for years now so people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true and if the world theyve been seeing is im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though i cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like donald trump 
and the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better there are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do we wont be able to appoint judges well gum up the works well create gridlock itll give us a political advantage so they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff so donald trump did not start this donald trump didnt start it he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it take credit for it and promote it thats what he always does and so now when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line all of a sudden these republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away oh this is too much so when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down suddenly thats a dealbreaker well what took you so long what the heck what took you so long all these years 
the mother jones piece made out like president obama is seeking retribution or  revenge  against republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years without knowing what goes on in the presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric that is a hard call to make with any surety barack obama does not strike one as being vindictive 
the president is though an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the white house is winding down and republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from donald trump it is prudent of the president to remind voters exactly what republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why donald trump is their standard bearer and why republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the white house",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/clinton-eyeroll.jpg,bias,trump kicks africanamerican protester north carolina rally calls thug,rmuse pm party doesnt learn lessons change based whats gone last year half think going catastrophic following opinion column r muse may understatement year say republican party verge fullon civil war may obvious many americans blame interparty discord standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy contributed tensions establishment types terrified trumps reckless disregard longevity party rebellionminded trump supporters real instigators koch brothers although oil magnates never trump bandwagon responsible trump loyalists within gop part teabagger movement intent disrupting nations political system indeed workings government tea party caucus extremist sect succeeded chasing former house speaker john boehner congress morphed inaptly named freedom caucus embraced trump set set fire party establishment isnt solely put current speaker paul ryan job although high trump supporters todo list noted wednesdays new york times mr trumps supporters said determined harness antiestablishment energy mr trump catalyzed refocus republican leadership congress target many seemeager take rightwing extremist actually took former house majority leader eric cantor conservative extremist house freedom caucus member david brat issued warning establishment republicans theres huge chunk people want see fight taken dc leadership comes smacks guy thats youre going put marker really american people scratching head saying really thats rich brat thorn establishments side since paul ryan became speaker joins dangerous number real conservatives cannot understand comport ryan establishment leaders dared criticize trump instead using majority advantage go hillary clinton donald trump senior aides prodding extremist conservatives revolt establishment leadership election defending trump fact besides assailing ryan sticking trump reported trump said privately ryan made pay heavy price disloyalty trump candidacy interview reuters complained people angry leadership party election win percent support top win lose going major bloodletting election establishment although powerful may face herculean task save party impending conflict within gop brewing longer donald trump candidate may brought experienced antiestablishment devotee run campaign chairman breitbart news stephen bannon made one primary goals get paul ryan house speaker true conservative intent tearing government restructure uberconservative paradise uberconservative different way saying nongovernment according koch brothers vision american libertarianism dont believe two groups closely aligned koch brothers heritage action america freedomworks pushing republicans party adopt extremist positions see civil war stellar opportunity greater influence partys decisions something establishment types resisting past days leaders koch groups joined extremist conservatives calling delay vote selecting candidate next new speaker house something typically occurring directly general election november regardless outcome according chief executive heritage action michael needham going hell pay establishment republicans dont bend extremist wing created kochs heavily courted donald trump mr needham said party doesnt learn lessons change based whats gone last year half think going catastrophe another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment said cant ignore millions millions people expressed election cycle dilemma republicans election matter outcome maintaining semblance stability political party doesnt seem likely trump loses big small extremists unleash whatever level hell muster establishment daring criticize trumps outrageous dangerous comments stump trump wins extremists emboldened purge party disloyal establishment types appears matter happens november end hostilities among republicans republican party establishment reckoning extremist wing content threatening full faith credit united states shutting government show anger four years internal bickering means true conservative past yearandahalf incitement donald trump republican party faces serious threat longterm survival threat began six years ago koch brothers ushered age extremist conservatives donald trump took advantage seize control republican party,1,Real

gabriel sherman writes at new york mag that when donald trump attacked the khan family over khizr khans speech at the democratic national convention he had no idea what a gold star family was 
you will remember that khizr khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to donald trump let me ask you have you even read the united states consitution i will gladly lend you my copy in this document look for the words liberty and equal protection of the law 
the fallout was predictable donald trump openly criticized lost it he attacked the khans religious beliefs saying if you look at his wife she was standing there she had nothing to say she probably maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say 
now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing because he is ignorant and because as mark cuban has observed he isnt interested in learning anything gabriel sherman explains 
you do know you just attacked a gold star family one adviser warned trump trump didnt know what a gold star family was whats that he asked to trump khizr khan and his wife ghazala were enemies who had said something mean about him just like rosie odonnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years wasnt it his right to respond ?the election is about the american people its not about you? manafort told trump according to a person briefed on the conversation trump countered with breitbarts report on khans purported belief in sharia ?hes not running for president? manafort shot back ?the clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message? 
of course trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasnt prepared to take the blame instead as sherman reveals he took it out on manafort in front of his senior advisors including ailes according to trump manafort wasnt able to get the media to focus on the right stuff 
no wonder when trump refuses to take manaforts advice and focus on the right stuff this is not to defend manafort who is at least as despicable as his boss but it serves as an example of how trumps first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic 
it was one of donald trumps most visible joe mccarthy moments and his response to khizr khan actually reinforced the point khan was trying to make

Sean Colarossi,2016-10-27T04:30:13.423+03:00,trump kicks africanamerican protester out of north carolina rally calls him a thug,"by rmuse    pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophic   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a fullon civil war and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded trump supporters the real instigators are the koch brothers 
although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself the tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job although that is high on the trump supporters todo list 
as noted in wednesdays new york times  mr trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that mr trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down  
the rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader eric cantor conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat issued a warning to establishment republicans 
 theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to dc leadership comes and smacks our guy thats where youre going to put down a marker really and the american people are just scratching their head saying really thats rich  
brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton 
donald trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump in fact besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy and during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win  percent if we had support from the top  win or lose there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a herculean task to save the party 
this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news stephen bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise and uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it 
two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers heritage action for america and freedomworks  have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting 
over the past few days leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome 
according to the chief executive of heritage action michael needham there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump mr needham said 
 if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophe  
another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle  
the dilemma for republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if trump wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november  it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans 
the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past yearandahalf of incitement by donald trump the republican party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-26-at-9.45.51-PM.png,bias,trump gotten republican party sued trying intimidate voters,reuters pm democrat hillary clintons top aides saturday lashed fbi director james comey igniting new controversy longrunning private email investigation less two weeks presidential election saying evidence wrongdoing accusing spreading innuendo roberta rampton steve holland daytona beach flagolden colo reuters democrat hillary clintons top aides saturday lashed fbi director james comey igniting new controversy longrunning private email investigation less two weeks presidential election saying evidence wrongdoing accusing spreading innuendo comey headed federal bureau investigation since notified us congress friday agency reviewing emails even though july decided seek prosecution clinton handling classified materials private email server secretary state john podesta heads clintons presidential campaign told reporters comeys letter congress light facts heavy innuendo urged comey come forward give answers american public exact nature fbis latest review emails sources close investigation friday said latest emails discovered part separate probe anthony weiner estranged husband top clinton aide huma abedin weiner former us congressman new york target fbi investigation illicit text messages alleged sent yearold girl north carolina nov elections quickly approaching republican presidential candidate donald trump pounded away new fbi development devoting large part campaign speech golden colorado attacking clinton arguing trusted presidency criminal action willful deliberate intentional purposeful trump said standing front hay bales stacked horse barn hillary set illegal server obvious purpose shielding illegal actions public disclosure exposure comey however provided details whether emails review seen first time fbi nature contents clintons campaign tried play new review theres evidence wrongdoing charge wrongdoing podesta said fbis latest announcement taking appropriate investigative steps learning emails appear pertinent earlier probe clinton campaign manager robby mook trying tamp speculation voter backlash late campaign said americans already factored knew email investigation would cast ballots dont see changing landscape undecided voters mook said clinton aides also said latest controversy energized supporters clinton campaigning florida saturday battleground state many analysts say trump must win order chance elected recent weeks trump running behind clinton public opinion polls justice department officials according source asked identified opposed fbi directors letter sent congress believe actions conflict justice department memo outlining instructions agencies act ways could influence elections attorney general loretta lynch discuss matter directly comey source said aides touch comey let known felt send letter followup congressional testimony earlier year regarding fbis probe clintons emails source said meanwhile clinton supporters rallied defense following fridays fbi disclosure congressional black caucus comprised members house representatives nearly democrats held news conference columbus ohio urged comey release details reporting steve holland golden colorado ans roberta rampton daytona beach florida additional reporting mark hosenball washington writing richard cowan editing james dalgleish leslie adlerand leslie adler clinton campaign urges fbi detail new developments email case added reuters sat oct th,1,Real

daytona beach fla reuters  heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign democratic candidate hillary clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states 
jennifer lopez will headline a free concert for clinton supporters in miami on saturday giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach  and some visual counterprogramming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the white house 
the federal bureau of investigation said on friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into clintons use of a private email system  a latebreaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the nov  vote 
celebritydriven events like the concert can serve as a bit of a distraction from the controversy said eric kasper a political scientist at the university of wisconsineau claire 
it is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive kasper said 
the jlo concert is the first in a series next week clinton will take the stage with jay z in cleveland and then with katy perry in philadelphia on nov  
a harvard university poll this week showed that among likely voters aged  to  clinton is leading republican rival donald trump a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show the apprentice 
but turnout is a concern the exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the white house has soured young americans on politics reutersipsos polling shows 
presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals said tevi troy who chronicled the strategy in his book what jefferson read ike watched and obama tweeted  years of pop culture in the white house 
campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture said troy a presidential historian who worked in the george w bush white house 
the events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate  and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians said kasper who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics 
it can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate for instance kasper said

by roberta rampton and steve holland 
daytona beach flagolden colo reuters  democrat hillary clintons top aides on saturday lashed out at fbi director james comey for igniting a new controversy over a longrunning private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo 
comey who has headed the federal bureau of investigation since  notified the us congress on friday that the agency is again reviewing emails even though in july it decided not to seek prosecution of clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state 
john podesta who heads clintons presidential campaign told reporters that comeys letter to congress was light on facts heavy on innuendo and he urged comey to come forward and give those answers to the american public about the exact nature of the fbis latest review of emails 
sources close to the investigation on friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into anthony weiner the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin 
weiner a former us congressman from new york is the target of an fbi investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a yearold girl in north carolina 
with the nov  elections quickly approaching republican presidential candidate donald trump pounded away at the new fbi development devoting a large part of a campaign speech in golden colorado to attacking clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency 
her criminal action was willful deliberate intentional and purposeful trump said standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure 
comey however has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the fbi or the nature of their contents 
clintons campaign tried to play down the new review theres no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing podesta said in the fbis latest announcement that it was taking appropriate investigative steps after learning of emails that appear to be pertinent to the earlier probe 
clinton campaign manager robby mook trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign said americans had already factored what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots 
we dont see it changing the landscape for undecided voters mook said 
clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters 
clinton was campaigning in florida on saturday a battleground state that many analysts say trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected 
in recent weeks trump has been running behind clinton in most public opinion polls 
justice department officials according to a source who asked not to be identified were opposed to the fbi directors letter being sent to congress and believe his actions conflict with a justice department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections 
while attorney general loretta lynch did not discuss the matter directly with comey the source said aides were in touch with each other 
comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a followup to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the fbis probe of clintons emails the source said 
meanwhile clinton supporters rallied to her defense following fridays fbi disclosure 
the congressional black caucus comprised of about  members of the house of representatives nearly all democrats held a news conference in columbus ohio and urged comey to release more details

by maurice tamman 
new york reuters  with  days to go before the us presidential election democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by  percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks according to the reutersipsos states of the nation project 
though data is not available for all early voting states clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as ohio and arizona and in republican party strongholds such as georgia and texas 
an estimated  million americans have voted so far in the election according to the university of floridas united states election project accounting for as much as  percent of the electorate 
overall clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the electoral college the reutersipsos survey showed 
having so many ballots locked down before the nov  election is good news for the clinton campaign on friday the federal bureau of investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to clintons close aide huma abedin those emails were found on a computer belonging to anthony weiner abedins estranged husband during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl the reutersipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged friday afternoon 
it remains unclear whether the fbi inquiry will upset the balance in the race the bureau disclosed nothing about the abedin emails including whether any of the messages were sent by or to clinton over the summer the fbi said it was closing its investigation into clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state until friday her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial fbi email probe 
clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances trump has said none of the accusations are true he also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes 
as of thursday clintons odds of receiving the  electoral college votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than  percent according to state of the nation polling results released saturday the project estimated she would win by  votes to  with  votes solidly for the democrat 
clintons lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by president barack obama over republican mitt romney at this point of the  race according to a reutersipsos poll taken at the time obama won the election by  electoral votes to romneys  
but even before the latest email news it had been a difficult week for clinton news coverage of trumps accusers had diminished while clinton confronted the almost daily release by wikileaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign managers account this weeks leaked messages raised questions about former president bill clintons finances 
and her lead in the states of the nation project fell slightly from last week though the projected electoral college votes hardly moved the number of states solidly for clinton slid from  to  this week trump didnt see any additional states tilt solidly to him but he did see some gains the swing states of pennsylvania colorado iowa and nevada all moved from leaning to clinton to being too close to call 
still trumps path to a victory is narrow and any realistic chance rests on his winning ohio north carolina and florida as of thursday ohio remained a tossup florida and north carolina were still tilting toward clinton according to the states of the nation results 
early voting data for florida and north carolina was not yet available this week in ohio clinton led trump by double digits among early voters the projects broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates 
in arizona clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters in the past month arizona has gradually moved from a solid trump state to a marginal clinton state although it is still too close to call according to the project results 
in georgia she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters overall georgia leans to trump but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week down from eights points last week and  points a month ago 
even in texas where trump enjoys a sizable lead clinton has a doubledigit edge among early voters according to project results

not only is donald trump a liar and a thinskinned crybaby but he is selfish never spending his own money when he can spend somebody elses this behavior was never more in evidence than the washington post s david fahrentholds account of a  a ribboncutting held by the association to benefit children for a nursery school when donald trump showed up sat down to appear to be a great supporter and then left without leaving a donation 
as sopan deb tweeted  
 sopan deb sopandeb october   
frank and kathie lee gifford were big donors and it is no wonder gifford was so shocked by trumps presence what had been exposed is that trumps life is a sham a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not 
as fahrenthold explains  
for as long as he has been rich and famous donald trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous he spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public  even nationally televised  promises to give his own money away it was in large part a facade a monthslong investigation by the washington post has not been able to verify many of trumps boasts about his philanthropy 
that philanthropist isnt the real trump the only person trump visibly cares about is donald trump he uses his foundation to buy himself nice things spending other peoples money for luxury items and collectibles when he does make donations it is again because he gives no money to his own foundation with other peoples money 
fahrenthold says that the only donation of trumps own money the paper could find from the period of  to today is a  gift to the police athletic league of new york city in

coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the religious right should declare that their messiah  donald trump  is being threatened with witchcraft 
lance wallnau whose twitter page claims to be your spiritual warfare guide to the  election appeared on the jim bakker show to push the crazy idea that many christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
watch courtesy of right wing watch 
oh sweet baby jesus the mighty lance has struck out what has happened of course is that the religious right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion its no wonder they feel in a fog  metaphorically or physically theyre selling their souls 
wallnau claims the left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of christ who doesnt work together and thats the dilemma that americas in right now even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the religious right has been organizing since goldwater lost in   
a hypocrite just cant catch a break it seems 
the web literally is coming down on america and whats sad is how many christians feel this fog on their head at times do you feel that its almost like everythings going wrong we dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the american culture and discipling the country and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
wherever theres agreement theres power the more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing the more power and authorization satan has to manifest so unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counterstrategy were going to deal with more and more fog and the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil 
so if you disagree with wallnau if you oppose trump it can only because youre manifesting the power of satan who in the old testament is gods lieutenant not his adversary so pick your testament i suppose 
lance wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wackadoodle instead this is nothing new as a nonchristian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists 
there are  years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents 
without charges of satanism and witchcraft you dont have the genocide of european and middle eastern paganism you dont have antijewish pogroms and you dont have the crusades or the spanish inquisition you dont have witchburnings 
what this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents 
not only do they deal in a conspiracyladen world a world free of facts but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not 
lets face it donald trumps biggest enemy is not satan but donald trump himself and wallnau can claim believers have an edge all they want but all the belief in the world wont overturn reality",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Paul-Ryan-Trump.jpg,bias,donald trump tanking trump supporter waves hillary noose doll rally,jason easley sun oct th republicans hoped fbi director james comeys letter new clinton related emails would swing election new series cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping lead within points trump arizona share twitter print post cbs news republicans hoped fbi director james comeys letter new clinton related emails would swing election new series cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping lead within points trump arizona battleground tracker found small margin comeys letter made democrats likely net support clinton individual battleground states clinton leads eight points pennsylvania north carolina colorado state four polled trump small two point lead arizona according cbs news larger demographic difference defining race clinton donald trump gender gap slightly larger last time states offsets smaller movement republicans trump put another way hillary clintons support women going larger rate republican movement towards trump first swing state polls taken since fbi director comey released infamous letter friday email story isnt moving voters reinforcing partisanship election democrats going vote clinton republicans going vote trump arent enough undecided voters swing election trump republicans hoping hail mary touchdown save trump clinton continues lead critical states little week go election day comey letter big october surprise isnt working voters hillary clinton maintains swing state leads comey email letter flops added jason easley sun oct th,1,Real

video 
chuck todd asked mook if he believed the email story could cost clinton the election 
he answered 
i dont think so look as i said we have over  volunteers out there were seeing record early voting numbers in north carolina florida look i would wager in nevada turnout is so strong among democrats there hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in nevada were feeling really good about this record turnout over  million people in our country now registered to vote fifty million of those are young people were just nose to the grindstone and were going to finish this out but people should not take anything for granted and were going to have to work hard to earn this 
hillary clinton could put nevada out of reach for trump this week but whether or not that happens is up to the voters if democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states the email story wont matter if democrats dont show up that is trumps only chance of winning 
the early voting numbers that hillary clinton is running up in florida north carolina and nevada are no accident clinton and the democratic party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states 
democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the  election but donal trumps refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area 
the final week before the election could be just as vital to democrats in swing states as election day if hillary clinton piles up big margins in early voting it could leave minimal drama for election night

the cbs news republicans hoped that fbi director james comeys letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within  points of trump in arizona 
battleground tracker found that by a small margin comeys letter made democrats more likely net  to support clinton 
in the individual battleground states clinton leads by eight points in pennsylvania  north carolina  and in colorado  the only state of the four polled where trump has a small two point lead in arizona  
according to cbs news  and the larger demographic difference defining the race between clinton and donald trump has been a gender gap  slightly larger now than the last time in these states  that offsets a smaller movement of republicans to trump 
to put it another way hillary clintons support with women is going up at a larger rate than republican movement towards trump 
these are the first swing state polls to be taken since fbi director comey released his now infamous letter on friday the email story isnt moving voters it is reinforcing the partisanship of the election democrats are going to vote clinton republicans are going to vote for trump and there arent enough undecided voters to swing the election to trump 
republicans were hoping for a hail mary touchdown to save trump but clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day if the comey letter is the big october surprise it isnt working on voters

Sarah Jones,2016-10-27T20:50:29.628+03:00,number of accusers grows to  as former miss finland accuses trump of sexual assault,"by robert franek on sun oct th  at  am imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing share on twitter print this post 
the following post written by the rev robert a franek is a part of politicus policy discussion in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy 
even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars psychic stress and issue coverage it seems all one has to do is put hillary clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds and yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists so much so that every time republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire and sadly this is not going away anytime soon as republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as sarah jones reported 
republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if hillary clinton is elected president yes there will be more toythrowing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations more wasteful spending on political witch hunts  sarah jones 
meanwhile women continue to come forward with painful heartbreaking stories of donald trumps sexual harassment and assault yet instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner woefully no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women and men not to report these crimes including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial 
after walking her readers through one incident of donald trumps public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge  sarah jones makes the following observation 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
she is right donald trump is despicable still there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects forced into silence and placed on trial for their assailants crimes 
this must change 
it is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment assault exploitation and humiliation more it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered unchallenged and dismissed it is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward 
it is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of genesis cant bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image 
supposed christian values champion and republican vice presidential nominee mike pence is more upset over an article he didnt read regarding voter suppression efforts by the trump campaign than any of the horrifying things donald trump has said including bragging about sexual assault 
these are not christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold failing to call out donald trumps abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable additionally supporting candidates like donald trump and mike pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and family values 
as a society we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture as much as we need changes in our laws and lawmakers at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story 
imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing

senate democrats arent fooling around they want answers and they want them right now as more details become known fbi director comeys motives have come under criticism comey was advised by attorney general lynch not to send his letter until after the election but he sent it anyway 
comey worried to fbi employees that his letter would be misunderstood but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all it is becoming difficult to look at comeys actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations 
the fbi director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the democratic nominee but can be used by her opponents for political purposes 
democrats are demanding answers and if james comey doesnt answer their questions by monday he will be forced to under oath if the democratic party wins a majority of seats in the senate

Jason Easley,2016-10-27T22:20:28.975+03:00,the dream team of hillary clinton and michelle obama fire democrats up in north carolina,"richard w painter wrote in a new york times an oped the fbis job is to investigate not to influence the outcome of an election 
such acts could also be prohibited under the hatch act which bars the use of an official position to influence an election that is why the fbi presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election the usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment 
and that is why on saturday i filed a complaint against the fbi with the office of special counsel which investigates hatch act violations and with the office of government ethics i have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics including two and a half years as the chief white house ethics lawyer for president george w bush and i never thought that the fbi could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations until this week 
this is the second complaint to be filed against fbi director comey the democratic coalition against trump has also filed a complaint against comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee 
suspicion around comeys actions has grown as the fbi director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election director comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as senate democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the fbi investigation if they win back the senate majority 
unless trump wins and republicans take control of congress director comey is going to have to answer for his decisions

fox news sundays chris wallace tried to blame hillary clinton for the email scandal that republicans created and got destroyed by clinton campaign manager robbie mook 
this exchange between fox news sunday host chris wallace and clinton campaign manager robbie mook highlighted why the email scandal isnt working for the gop 
video 
transcript via fox news sunday wallace the last question i want to ask you is that youre acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was hillary clinton who brought this into the election 
i want to go back to the email exchange on march nd  when the new york times broke the story about hillary clinton using private emails were going to put it up on the screen 
clinton adviser neera tanden why didnt they get the stuff out like  months ago so crazy 
campaign chairman john podesta unbelievable tanden i guess i know the answer they wanted to get away with it 
robby it was clinton who delayed and it was clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign 
mook and it is secretary clinton who has said this was a mistake it is secretary clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation and it was secretary clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation and what secretary clinton is doing now is saying if theres new information get it out on the table lets get it out these could be duplicates 
again its been reported these emails may not have been sent or received by secretary clinton we dont know anything and this close to an election this unprecedented announcement of new information when  when again its been reported by yahoo news that  that the fbi may have not even seen it that  that  that director comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesnt even know what the information is thats disturbing and were just asking him get everything out there that he knows 
fox news has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of clinton so they have been reduced to whining about why she didnt release the emails sooner what wallace left out was that the release of clintons emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure 
hillary clinton didnt cause this email scandal house republicans misused their benghazi select committee to go on a fishing expedition for hillary clintons emails 
robbie mook destroyed fox news with facts because unlike donald trump hillary clinton hasnt worked to keep information hidden from the public trump has not released his tax returns medical records or an accounting of his business dealings with russia trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than  years 
republicans and conservative media are blaming clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election 
clintons campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rubio-water.jpg,bias,trump proposes canceling election calls black communities ghettos ohio rally,full text sen reids letter director comey dear director comey actions recent months demonstrated disturbing double standard treatment sensitive information appears clear intent aid one political party another writing inform office determined actions may violate hatch act bars fbi officials using official authority influence election partisan actions may broken law double standard established actions clear communications top officials national security community become clear possess explosive information close ties coordination donald trump top advisors russian government foreign interest openly hostile united states trump praises every opportunity public right know information wrote months ago calling information released public danger american interests releasing yet continue resist calls inform public critical information contrast soon came possession slightest innuendo related secretary clinton rushed publicize negative light possible moreover tarring secretary clinton thin innuendo overruled longstanding tradition explicit guidance department rushed take step eleven days presidential election despite fact know information possess could entirely duplicative information already examined exonerated secretary clinton know memo authored deputy attorney general sally yates march makes clear justice department employees including subject hatch act memo defines political activity prohibited hatch act activity directed towards success failure political party candidate partisan political office partisan political group clear doublestandard established actions strongly suggests highly selective approach publicizing information along timing intended success failure partisan candidate political group please keep mind supporter past republicans filibustered nomination delayed confirmation longer previous nominee position led fight get confirmed believed principled public servant deepest regret see wrong sincerely senator harry reid reid basically accused comey violating hatch act releasing letter close presidential election even though harry reid retiring bad news comey reids letter clear sign senate democrats arent going let matter drop democrats take back senate director comey brace agencys methods going congressional investigation,1,Real

a trump supporter sporting a hillary for prison tshirt chanted jews sa in support of his candidate during a rally in arizona on saturday 
the target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for trumps rhetoric at every rally 
the context while the crowd was chanting usa one man chanted jews sa words like that cant be spun or read into the intent and meaning were obvious to everyone 
watch here on video obtained by the huffington post  
this sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that donald trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction it may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which trump has shown contempt but it is not 
muslims jews immigrants labor taxpayers latinos hispanics mexicans africanamericans women pows veterans people with disabilities gold star families and the military have felt the sting of trumps words and the disdain in his heart 
throughout this campaign season the vitriol against hillary clinton saw no limit signs and tshirts too disgusting to quote in this article chants of lock her up at the republican convention and since trump promised his base of thugs lowlifes and haters he would weaken the first amendment strengthen the second and establish the altright utopia 
hillary clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race she also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar she was competing for who we are and who we could be for all the trump claims that the media is rigged in clintons favor it was trump who got free advertising who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign 
there is no doubt that hillary clinton will keep her promise to fight for us she has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign every time hillary clinton called out donald trumps sexist comments she was fighting for all women who were attacked humiliated and sexually abused by men like trump every time clinton shamed trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the khan family she was standing up for every gold star family she was also standing up for every muslimamerican the same is true every time clinton condemned trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to altright stereotypes about africanamericans innercities and africanamerican communities 
every time trump spewed hate in whatever direction hillary clinton defended the target 
so no this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils like every election this is about choosing our next president more importantly its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be

your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election through your partisan actions you may have broken the law 
the double standard established by your actions is clear 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity the public has a right to know this information i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public there is no danger to american interests from releasing it and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information 
by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible 
moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton 
as you know a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march   makes clear that all justice department employees including you are subject to the hatch act the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group 
the clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant 
with the deepest regret i now see that i was wrong

please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant 
with the deepest regret i now see that i was wrong

these are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat the comey letter didnt move the needle for trump it didnt give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for hillary clinton

Jason Easley,2016-10-28T03:20:33.086+03:00,retired  star general blasts trump for not supporting us troops,"by rmuse on sun oct th  at  pm the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters the faintest appearance of using the agency to influence our election is deeply troubling share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse 
as a nation of laws the american people should and most likely do demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency one thing every american who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is as an occasional print journalist this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons the scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney 
apparently the federal bureau of investigation fbi director james comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution however as it turns out mr comey did get a memo  from the department of justice in the form of a warning  but because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to house republicans and not the department of justice he ignored the doj counsel to do a solid for the gop less than two weeks before a presidential election 
since mr comey cant keep it investigations in his pants or follow longstanding law enforcement and investigative rules or take heed to justice department warnings it is incumbent on president barack obama to summarily fire fbi director james comey on the morning of wednesday november th  why should president obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the fbi so as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election something fbi director james comey is apparently incapable of comprehending 
this incident just like the one in july when comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in july and then publicly testified before congress to discuss the bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason first as mentioned above not only did the department of justice warn mr comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all much less so close to an election that warning came after the fbi contacted the doj about going public with information the bureau admitted it had not yet even  reviewed  that was precisely what comey told his republican buddies in a letter to congress 
in the letter  comey told congressional republicans that the fbi really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to hillary clintons private email server but what he did  know  for sure was that they  appeared  to be pertinent even though his agency the fbi had not yet examined them so the real pertinent question is why did mr comey publicly inform congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some  partisan drama  into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome 
it is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from mr comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in july to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the doj weighed in or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan republican committee in congress and no it was not to defend the bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against clinton only a braindead moronic imbecile or partisan republican hack would begin to think that the fbi cia local sheriff or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation for dogs sake even the s fictional sheriff andy griffiths hapless deputy barney fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or department of justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law 
according to mr comey who was  stung by criticism from both democrats and republicans  as well as former prosecutors and  appeared to be on the defensive   he felt obligated to inform republicans in congress  even though the bureau really didnt  know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails  likely because he knew they did not come from hillary clinton as an aside sarah jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the fbi uncovered while investigating  serial sexter  anthony weiners laptop computer ipad and cellphone and no anthony weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate hillary clinton 
it doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting house republicans as interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile said  the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters  even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling  ms brazile demanded more information from comey and didnt conceal her concern over comey interfering with the election 
mr comey claimed very conveniently one might add that as a diedinthewool republican he contributed to john mccain and willard romneys presidential campaigns in  and  respectively that he is not a republican now that was his remark back in july when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the department of justice not the federal bureau of investigation it was a suspicious  confession  in july and it is nearly impossible to believe in late october after he ignored department of justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just  days before an election and before the bureau had even reviewed anything 
comey cannot possibly remain as head of the federal bureau of investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation if comey hadnt taken heat for his reveal in july and a warning from the justice department this week then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention but since he was warned and is not an inept law enforcement official it is more than reasonable to believe that comeys most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on november   because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move something a sap like james comey might try but not president obama",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-27-at-8.25.39-PM.png,bias,trumps new defense strategy access hollywood tape blame microphone,hrafnkell haraldsson mon oct st donald trump candidate frequently saying false things day days share twitter print post cnns brian stelter calls donald trump uniquely factchallenged candidate prelude introducing daniel dale washington correspondent toronto star fact checks every single word trump utters tallies paper dale says factcheckers look two three things trump says meticulously factchecks posts article doesnt work candidate frequently saying false things day days example dale tallied trump lies tuesday october donald trump said false things yesterday trumpcheck pictwittercomewfyfedfx daniel dale ddale october dale pointed followed recordtying false claims monday coincidentally day trump called fact checkers scum watch courtesy cnns reliable sources massive imbalance frequency dishonesty ddale says trump lies lot clinton httpstcokpkvpntmo reliable sources reliablesources october mainstream media likes play false equivalence game equivalence trump clinton dale told stelter massive imbalance frequency dishonesty trump says dale normal political liar example look presidential debates dale found trump false statements opposed clinton dales judgment comparison level accuracy opponent trump also lies pointlessly argues dale explaining brian stelter gets things wrong political advantage gained cases clear whether hes lying confused unwilling take time learn facts mark cubans complaint course trump interest learning end matters less trump lies especially since busily convincing base hillary clinton dishonest candidate working trope frequently repeated trumps supporters correct often want effect lie taken hold one many many likely expected observational bias takes care rest trump base effectively lost shared reality dale tweeted last night trump loses smart republican excavation going involve long hard base reeducation given gops history facts good luck image screen capture twitter,1,Real

on friday the supreme court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of gloucester county school board vs gg  this gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like plain and simple 
at issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with 
last summer the court granted the school boards request to put a lower court ruling in the students favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the supreme court justice breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy 
the virginia school board established a policy mirroring bathroom police laws in red states like north carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth 
in this case the district court ruled against gg by relying on a  regulation allowing schools to provide separate toilet locker room and shower facilities based on sex provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex 
in january  the department of educations office of civil rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a school must treat transgender students in a manner consistent with their gender identity 
because of that letter the us court of appeals for the th circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of gg it relied on a  supreme court decision that courts generally should defer to an agencys interpretation of its own regulation 
in reality the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case first this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women poc and members of the lgbt community second the right wing is hoping to weaken federal agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own

Sean Colarossi,2016-10-28T04:10:02.350+03:00,trumps new defense strategy on access hollywood tape blame the microphone,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on mon oct st  at  am in donald trump you have a candidate who is frequently saying  false things in a day up to  on some days share on twitter print this post 
cnns brian stelter calls donald trump a uniquely factchallenged candidate which is a prelude to introducing daniel dale washington correspondent for the toronto star  who fact checks every single word trump utters and tallies them up for his paper  
dale says most factcheckers look at two or three things trump says meticulously factchecks them and posts an article but that doesnt work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying  false things in a day up to  on some days 
for example dale tallied  trump lies on tuesday october  donald trump said  false things yesterday trumpcheck pictwittercomewfyfedfx 
 daniel dale ddale october   
which as dale pointed out  followed his recordtying  false claims on monday not coincidentally a day on which trump called fact checkers scum 
watch courtesy of cnns reliable sources there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty ddale says trump lies a lot more than clinton httpstcokpkvpntmo 
 reliable sources reliablesources october   
the mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between trump and clinton as dale told stelter there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty trump says dale is not a normal political liar 
for example look at the presidential debates  in which dale found  trump false statements as opposed to  by clinton 
dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent 
trump also lies pointlessly argues dale explaining to brian stelter that 
he gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts 
this was mark cubans complaint of course that trump has no interest in learning 
in the end it matters less why trump lies than that he does especially since he is busily convincing his base that hillary clinton is the dishonest candidate and it is working this is a trope frequently repeated by trumps supporters you can correct them as often as you want it will have no effect 
the lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected and observational bias takes care of the rest the trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality and as dale tweeted last night 
if trump loses the smart republican excavation is going to have to involve some long hard base reeducation 
given the gops history with facts good luck with that

Sean Colarossi,2016-10-28T05:12:12.375+03:00,trump is ahead in zero national polls while the media continues close race narrative,"by rmuse    am the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
for almost all secular humanists organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation throughout recorded history the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents but any humans it comes in contact with that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women apparently the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population 
on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a lastditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use other reports reveal that the taxexempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure question   question  simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over  and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts question  contains no references to the catholic or any other church and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries  
a spokesman for the boston archdiocese terrence donilon made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  
 it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities its a recognition that if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries  
seriously that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use taxfree congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned much less affected by the outcome of an election catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests and relieve americas overburdened judicial system 
now the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally whether they inhale or eat it will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries  that is an odd assertion on yet another point surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet including those in massachusetts are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter  verse  the catholics  almighty god  said 
 out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food  and he continues in verses    then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it the lord god commanded the man saying from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die  
although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities  years ago  there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past twothousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal 
in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with taxexempt money an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question  jim borghesani said  
 the archdiocese has come up with a position that frankly we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested  
one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans mainly americans of color sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat  obviously that is the case and according to a new set of data keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every  seconds of every day of the year 
why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general and the criminalization of marijuana in particular as noted by michael stone over at patheos what the massachusetts catholics and mormons are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color  mr stone really nails it when he said that by spending taxexempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow  
the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy besides implicit racism because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using taxexempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible  mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned 
the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an antimarijuana super pac  but they are using taxexempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society however if the church is so flush with money why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests or dog forbid use that taxexempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need 
the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right what is wrong and how to stay out of the proverbial hell that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated taxexempt money to impact read control their private lives the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question  will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hardearned money 
this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen except donald trump it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with taxexempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans many of whom use recreational cannabis

Hrafnkell Haraldsson,2016-10-28T16:28:39.022+03:00,in the first  days of october trump gave just k to his own campaign,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    am we cant do waterboarding its far too tough were fighting on a different level we have to be toughand in some cases pretty vicious   
donald trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the middle east that he supported a war brought to us by a republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts trump is also lying about the facts which at least brings our countrys middle east ordeal fullcircle 
according to trump speaking at a rally in new mexico  and youve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie  hillary brought disaster to iraq syria libya and every place that she touches she empowered iran and she unleashed isis by leaving that big vacuum 
of course it was republican president george w bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with iraq stipulating that america draw down its combat strength reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in iraq or a negation of isis but a second us invasion on top of the rise of isis 
we want peace through strength trump told the crowd we dont want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads 
well in fact we did want to be in that war we invaded iraq not vice versa 
trump went on to say 
drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand we havent had  this is medieval times this is medieval times and then we cant do waterboarding its far too tough you know were fighting on a different level see were fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious to be honest with you pretty vicious but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country  weve spent  trillion in the middle east  trillion and we couldve rebuilt our country twice 
never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law never mind that a  senate intelligence committees report said torture doesnt work trumps argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him 
this is trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means 
he doesnt because he cant prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesnt make us barbarians ourselves he certainly cant prove because that senate report says otherwise that torturing people will win the war 
the claim of  million by the way is one trump made last week in charlotte nc as well and politifact ruled it half true at the time saying 
trump is citing the highend estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in iraq and afghanistan yet he is confusing money thats been spent with money that researchers say will be spent 
the point here is that this is a war begun not by obama and certainly not by hillary clinton who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so while trump continued to deny he was ever for it despite the facts to the contrary 
when trump says we have to be pretty vicious he is also saying we have to be pretty dishonest and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as donald trump 
trump has said he loves war he has said he likes to be unpredictable he has asked why we cant use nuclear weapons since we have them this is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands 
this is a man who no matter how much he claims otherwise does not understand how the world works and he does not understand that by promoting torture he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the islamic state by promising to do precisely what they want him to do",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kirk-duckworth-thailand.jpg,bias,banishment trump begun american people tuning,hrafnkell haraldsson mon oct st pm trump refused produce records sought prosecutors months said oath destroying whole time share twitter print post newsweek kurt eichenwald struck reporting donald trump refused produce records sought prosecutors months said oath destroying whole time whole strategy writes newsweek article swears written comeys announcement deny impede delay destroying documents court ordered hand reveals republican nominee father real estate company battled federal government civil charges refused rent apartments africanamericans shortly government filed case october trump attacked falsely declared reporters feds evidence father discriminated minorities instead attempting force lease welfare recipients couldnt pay rentthe familys attempts slow federal case times nonsensical trump submitted affidavit contending government engaged unspecified wrongdoing releasing statements press day brought case without first formal communications contended hed learned complaint listening car radio morning trumps sworn statement lie court records show government filed complaint phoned almost immediately afterward government later notified media press release six months original filing case nowhere trumps repeatedly ignored deadlines produce records answers questions known interrogatoriesfinally subpoena trump appeared short deposition asked missing documents made shocking admission trumps destroying corporate records previous six months documentretention program conducted inspections determine files might sought discovery requests might otherwise related case instead order save space trump testified officials company tossing documents shredder garbage trump accuse hillary clinton destroying emails nearly every day means covering deflecting misdeeds regard false affidavits deny delay strategies writes eichenwald trump cos hid destroyed records sought court donald trump world class liar man known deflection tactics projecting guilt onto others foundation trouble point finger clinton foundation sexual assault allegations point finger bill hillary clinton kurt eichenwald dug donald trumps deplorable past revealed real donald trump pretty revelation eichenwald david fahrenthold shows trump even worse human last wonder deplorables love much turns trump put investigators months destroyed emails added hrafnkell haraldsson mon oct st,1,Real

newsweek s kurt eichenwald has struck again reporting that donald trump refused  produce records sought by prosecutors for  months said under oath was destroying them whole time 
the whole strategy he writes at newsweek in an article he swears was written before comeys announcement was deny impede and delay while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over 
in  he reveals the republican nominee his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to africanamericans 
shortly after the government filed its case in october trump attacked he falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldnt pay their rentthe familys attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any formal communications with him he contended that hed learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning but trumps sworn statement was a lie court records show that the government had filed its complaint at  am and phoned him almost immediately afterward the government later notified the media with a press release  six months after the original filing the case was nowhere because the trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions known as interrogatoriesfinally under subpoena trump appeared for a short deposition when asked about the missing documents he made a shocking admission the trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no documentretention program they had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case instead in order to save space trump testified officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage 
so trump can accuse hillary clinton of destroying emails  and he does nearly every day  but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard 
with false affidavits and deny and delay strategies writes eichenwald trump  his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court 
donald trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics projecting his own guilt onto others his foundation in trouble point the finger at the clinton foundation sexual assault allegations point the finger at bill and hillary clinton 
once again kurt eichenwald has dug into donald trumps deplorable past and revealed the real donald trump its not pretty and each revelation from eichenwald and david fahrenthold shows trump to be an even worse human being than the last

cnn has obtained brand new audio of north carolina republican senator richard burr joking about gun owners putting a bullseye on hillary clinton 
the despicable comments come as burr faces a close senate race against democratic opponent deborah ross both candidates are within a point of each other according to realclearpolitics 
more of the cnn report  
the north carolina republican locked in a tight race for reelection quipped that as he walked into a gun shop nothing made me feel better than seeing a magazine about rifles with a picture of hillary clinton on the front of it 
i was a little bit shocked at that  it didnt have a bullseye on it he said saturday to gop volunteers prompting laughter from the crowd in mooresville north carolina but on the bottom right of the magazine it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for so let me assure you theres an army of support out there right now for our candidates 
this type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to republican leaders in  as the campaign has gone on the hateful and violent rhetoric particularly from the man at the top of the republican ticket has become increasingly worse 
at one point this year donald trump suggested that second amendment people should take up arms against clinton if she nominates a supreme court justices they dont like he also said that hed like to see what happens if the democratic nominees bodyguards were disarmed 
as cnn notes trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language  or anything hes ever said or done  but burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed although it does not excuse what he said 
the comment i made was inappropriate and i apologize for it the republican senator said according to cnn

cnbc reported  fbi director james comey argued privately that it was too close to election day for the united states government to name russia as meddling in the us election and ultimately ensured that the fbis name was not on the document that the us government put out a former fbi official tells cnbc 
 
according to the former official comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to a foreign power was trying to undermine the election he believed it to be true but was against putting it out before the election comeys position this official said was if it is said it shouldnt come from the fbi which as youll recall it did not 
director comey didnt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm republican presidential nominee donald trump but he had no qualms about sending a letter to congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election 
with each new revelation and detail it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that fbi director comey may have violated the hatch act with his letter to congress it is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections 
when the information was bad for donald trump comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election however he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage hillary clintons campaign

trumps decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given trumps history of not paying for services performed it wont be the last it is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain

while the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a nonstory  fbi director james comeys vague letter regarding more emails related to hillary clinton  news about donald trumps ties to russia continues to gain steam 
not only did nbc just report that the fbi is now in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia but slate also reported on monday that a trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a russian bank 
slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the russian cyber attack of the dnc they stumbled onto something unexpectedly 
the report 
in late july one of these scientistswho asked to be referred to as tea leaves a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their datafound what looked like malware emanating from russia the destination domain had trump in its name which of course attracted tea leaves attention but his discovery of the data was pure happenstancea surprising needle in a large haystack of dns lookups on his screen i have an outlier here that connects to russia in a strange way he wrote in his notes he couldnt quite figure it out at first but what he saw was a bank in moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the trump organization on fifth avenue 
more data was needed so he began carefully keeping logs of the trump servers dns activity as he collected the logs he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world six of them began scrutinizing them for clues 
the researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack the communication wasnt the work of bots the irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversationconversations that began during office hours in new york and continued during office hours in moscow it dawned on the researchers that this wasnt an attack but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank 
this news doesnt come out of nowhere trump has repeatedly praised vladimir putin as a strong leader all while taking prorussia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a kremlin wishlist 
the clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by clinton senior policy adviser jake sullivan 
this secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of trumps ties to russia it certainly seems the trump organization felt it had something to hide given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists 
this line of communication may help explain trumps bizarre adoration of vladimir putin and endorsement of so many prokremlin positions throughout this campaign it raises even more troubling questions in light of russias masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt hillary clintons campaign we can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between trump and russia as part of their existing probe into russias meddling in our elections 
trumps prorussia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence the more information that comes out the clearer it is that the republican nominee has connections to russia that he is hiding from voters

Jason Easley,2016-10-28T22:03:39.478+03:00,revived clinton email scandal killed by a slew of new facts in record time,"by sean colarossi on mon oct st  at  pm trump used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited share on twitter print this post 
while donald trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades the new york times reported on monday that trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share 
according to the times the republican nominee used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited 
the report 
tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for the new york times said mr trumps tax avoidance maneuver conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time whatever loophole existed was not exploited here but stretched beyond any recognition said steven m rosenthal a senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center who helped draft tax legislation in the early s 
moreover the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of american tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to mr trump for losing vast amounts of other peoples money  in this case money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in atlantic city 
the reason that trump bent over backward  and potentially broke laws  to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to stave off financial ruin 
this is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his successful business background 
yet he calls himself the king of debt his businesses have declared bankruptcy six times he has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes he lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to russia 
all of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background 
even as all of this information is out there american voters still know very little about donald trumps finances because he has refused to be transparent about them 
and consider this what trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting if it werent he would have already released them 
the latest new york times story is just the latest installment of trumps shady business background the media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the countrys pocketbook",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/obama-clinton-together.jpg,bias,trump wrecks hope gop taking advantage clinton email investigation,hrafnkell haraldsson tue nov st last springnew york take legal action collect unpaid taxes trumpowned company owns trademark boeing looked yesterday kurt eichenwalds revelation donald trump put investigators six months busily destroying emails hardly trumps misdeed many people realize donald trump moment seventyfive legal issues hanging head hes lying times day followers much less excuse mainstream media thoroughly distracted clinton email nonstory divert attention away legally questionable activities usa today reported end october two weeks election day least plus lawsuits involving trump businesses remain open according ongoing nationwide analysis state federal court records usa today surprise one trump already deadbeating pollster one trump case nonpayment tips caterers trump soho hotel new york city scheduled go trial week election day one thing become clear throughout election trump pay bills earlier covered incident declined finish paying florida contractor work one resorts decided contractor paid enough even though wasnt agreedupon amount trump got nailed court k attorneys fees case examples usa todays investigation trump faces significant open litigation tied businesses angry members jupiter fla golf course say cheated refunds dues former employee club claims fired reporting sexual harassment theres fraud case brought trump university students say moguls company ripped tens thousands tuition sham real estate course trump also defending lawsuits tied campaign disgruntled gop political consultant sued million saying trump defamed another suit class action says campaign violated consumer protection laws sending unsolicited text messages pointed usa todays nick penzenstadler john kelly lawsuits dog trump white house win immunity president america world treated spectacle president united states make trip trip court settle highly questionable personal business affairs harassment cases sex discrimination lawsuits fraud unpaid bills racist comments defamation cases involving trump university usa today notes recently last springnew york take legal action collect unpaid taxes trumpowned company owns trademark boeing jetted mogul campaign rallies across country cases likely grow trump promised sue new york times women nymag maintains exhaustive list accused sexual assault usa today says spent six months researching court records exclusive analysis say found unprecedented mountain legal battles presidential candidate ranging skirmishes pageant contestants multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits cases offer clues leadership style billionaire would bring white house donald trump claims clinton tainted claims clintons emails bigger watergate day tweeted must let crookedhillary take criminal scheme oval office draintheswamp comes man would turn pennsylvania avenue morality nogo zone facts including new disclosures trumps ties russian server potentially illegal ploy avoid paying taxes make clear trump deadbeat liar drains swamp first one drain,1,Real

republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for voter fraud 
the united states district court in new jersey ordered discovery on donald trump and the rncs poll monitoring efforts with a hearing on november th just days before the november th election 
the order demands affidavits from several parties including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendants rncs efforts with the trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country as indicated by kellyanne conway 
affidavits are also demanded from several republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide voter fraud monitoring and poll monitoring such as rnc member rob gleasons efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in philadelphia pennsylvania and rnc member ronna romney mcdaniels efforts in michigan to prepare a massive statewide antivoter fraud effort 
the rnc must also answer for governor mike pences comments that the trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure ballot integrity 
this is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante 
rick hasen at election law blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad pretty broad discovery required in short order with hearing on november  
however the judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the dnc given the time frame but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes 
the dnc filed a lawsuit against the republican national committee for violating a  court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over donald trumps claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters 
donald trumps urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own often in urban areas to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isnt likely to stand for it 
so now discovery has been courtordered which is just more bad news for republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the white house 
its exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation dont let anyone dissuade you from voting

we looked yesterday at kurt eichenwalds revelation that donald trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails that is hardly trumps only misdeed but how many people realize that donald trump at this moment has   seventyfive  legal issues hanging over his head 
hes lying  to  times a day and has his followers  and with much less excuse the mainstream media  thoroughly distracted by the clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities 
usa today reported at the end of october that just two weeks before election day at least  of the plus lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open according to an ongoing nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by usa today 
it will surprise no one because trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster  that one trump case over nonpayment of tips to caterers at trump soho hotel in new york city is scheduled to go to trial a week before election day 
if one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that trump does not pay his bills earlier we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts having decided that the contractor had been paid enough even though it wasnt the agreedupon amount trump got nailed by the court for k in attorneys fees in that case 
just a few examples from usa todays investigation 
trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses angry members at his jupiter fla golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment theres a fraud case brought by trump university students who say the moguls company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign a disgruntled gop political consultant sued for  million saying trump defamed her another suit a class action says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages 
as pointed out by usa todays nick penzenstadler and john kelly these lawsuits will dog trump into the white house should he win he will have no immunity because he is president and america  and the world  will be treated to the spectacle of the president of the united states having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs 
there are harassment cases sex discrimination lawsuits fraud unpaid bills racist comments defamation cases involving trump university as usa today notes as recently as last springnew york had to take legal action to collect  in unpaid taxes on the trumpowned company that owns the trademark boeing  that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country 
and those  cases will likely grow 
trump has promised after all to sue the new york times and each of the women  nymag maintains an exhaustive list  who have accused him of sexual assault 
usa today says it spent six months researching court records the exclusive analysis they say found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits the cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the white house 
donald trump claims clinton is tainted he claims clintons emails are bigger than watergate the other day tweeted  we must not let crookedhillary take her criminal scheme into the oval office draintheswamp 
this comes from the man who would turn the  pennsylvania avenue into a morality nogo zone

Jason Easley,2016-10-28T22:49:01.981+03:00,gop scandal falls apart as new emails didnt come from hillary clintons server,"by rmuse    am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in north carolina   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries concluded donald trump projected republicans guilt for election rigging either through vote obstruction or suppression onto democrats and his opponent hillary clinton republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of barack obama in  and they have only ramped up their  election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath 
yesterday the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the  coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state  what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was  right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state  
the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of mostly african american democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort moore and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were  bounced back as undeliverable  
most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging such as james edward arthur sr had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their  original registration address  and were victims of a  simple postal service error  
mr arthur is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last  elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue arthur testified that he like thousands of other african american democratic voters never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy mr arthur said 
 if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted  
it is what any sane human being would consider  election rigging  simply because the tricounty ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years 
according to the naacp lawsuit north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which  bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final  days before an election  republican election officials state officials defended their  election rigging  and said they were justified in  purging tensofthousands  of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility the definition of systemic on an individual basis 
however the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last year shane hubers challenged the registration of voters?the majority who are them democrats ?in beaufort county 
in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit cumberland county one  individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of  mostly democratic voters  in moore county the secretary of the local republican party n carol wheeldon challenged approximately  mainly african american registered voters likely because they do not vote for republicans 
the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit penda hair said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican  election rigging  conspiracy 
 we know that in two of the counties the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties  ms hair also noted that  in moore county the return address of a rightwing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters  she said it is also a deliberate act of  election rigging  by republicans 
the president of the north carolina naacp reverend dr william barber said 
 we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution  
the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since  using this election rigging  process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case 
it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years 
last thursday us district court judge loretta biggs ordered north carolina republicans to permit those tensofthousands of voters to cast provisional ballots it is highly doubtful that north carolina republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters 
republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the american people first elected barack obama as president and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to suppress or obstruct the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support republicans to be perfectly clear it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression obstruction or disenfranchisement it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections and it is only republicans and the koch brothers outfit the american legislative exchange council alec who are behind each and every attempt in republicancontrolled states to kill democracy by doing what the republican party standard bearer donald trump is guilty of projecting rig elections",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/black-Trump-suppoter-kicked-out.png,bias,hillary clinton laughs asked new emails could sink campaign,major omen potential election disaster republicans donald trump scored lowest rating history gallups presidential leadership poll gallup released presidential leadership survey results historically bad donald trump voters rate trump worse presidential candidate gallups records personality leadership qualities president previous readings taken late october campaigns years registered voters said two majorparty candidates right personality leadership qualities sharp contrast trumps current clintons rating one percentage point previous low score clintons score low one point range previous presidential cycles going back trumps score twenty percent lowest score history poll voters arent going elect man next president view lacking basic qualities presidential leadership popular vote total may reflect nations political polarization reason electoral map projections continue look good democratic candidate donald trump failed elemental test presidential candidate doesnt look act behave like person qualities needed occupy oval office lead united states america last week election day tension air normal fundamental motivating factors contest havent changed democrats holding electoral map advantage donald trump become central issue question ballot republicans look heading major ballot box disaster voters believe donald trump fit president,1,Real

rachel maddow traces the history of the postcivil war enforcement acts signed by president ulysses s grant including the ku klux klan act  or the enforcement act of   stat  which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters 
to show that the klan act is not vestigial but very much relevant in this election maddow points to the citation of this law by the democrat party in a whole raft of lawsuits in nevada arizona pennsylvania and ohio alleging voter intimidation 
maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway the significance of the klan act is that it prohibits conspiracy to prevent by force intimidation or threat any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president or as a member of congress of the united states 
as an example of the role the kkk plays in trumps campaign maddow produced the kkks newspaper of today which bills itself as the political voice of white christian america which you might note is identical with fox news demographic this paper she says has been turning up on front lawns in the great state of georgia 
watch courtesy of msnbc discussion begins at  mark 
tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development this is the newspaper of the ku klux klan today its the crusader the political voice of white christian america the premier voice of white resistance theyve got  you see the white power symbol there in the upper righthand corner theyve got a whole media operation going on apparently watch white pride tv listen to kkk radio  hours a day this newsletter is about  pages long features articles on the threat of nonwhite immigration a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people theres an article by the founder of the america first party which is all about the terrorist jews he brags in his byline that hes the man who david duke credits for awakening him to the threat of jewish supremacism its exactly what you would think from the ku klux klan newspaper if you knew there was a ku klux klan newspaper these days but the front page full page story is make america great again with a big featured center photo of donald trump its one of several articles in the paper about trump including this inset article about how trumps candidacy is moving the dialogue forward  those are a couple of the many many robocalls that were made during the republican primary campaign on behalf of donald trumps candidacy calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the american national super pac the trump campaign doesnt appear to have anything to do with these calls they reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a trump donor it was further embarrassing to the trump campaign when this guy this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls he was initially picked to be a trump delegate to the republican convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported 
donald trumps white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a white homeland and that of necessity the united states must be this white homeland as maddow has pointed out in the past and by their own admission their eugenics insanity is now out in the open because of donald trump 
dont believe maddow demographics pro looked at  donald trump twitter supporters and found that more than one third follow white nationalist twitter accounts 
the fact is trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it brought it into his own movement which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white workingclass americans whatever the mainstream media tells you

Sarah Jones,2016-10-29T03:41:08.721+03:00,hillary clinton laughs when asked if the new emails could sink her campaign,"in a major omen of potential election disaster for republicans donald trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of gallups presidential leadership poll 
gallup released their presidential leadership survey and the results were historically bad for donald trump 
voters rate trump worse than any other presidential candidate in gallups records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have previous readings were taken in late october in the   and  campaigns in those years between  and  of registered voters said the two majorparty candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities  a sharp contrast to trumps current  clintons rating of  is one percentage point below the previous low score 
clintons score while low was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to  trumps score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll 
voters arent going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership the popular vote total in  may reflect the nations political polarization but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the democratic candidate 
donald trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate he doesnt look act or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the oval office and lead the united states of america

Jason Easley,2016-10-29T03:41:08.886+03:00,the real reason why the clinton email scandal is back has nothing to do with helping trump,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  am a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror share on twitter print this post 
a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror 
the report alleges that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin and that russian intelligence claims to have compromised trump on his visits and could blackmail him 
david corn at mother jones reported 
mother jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote the first memo based on the former intelligence officers conversations with russian sources noted russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting trump for at least  years aim endorsed by putin has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance it maintained that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin including on his democratic and other political rivals it claimed that russian intelligence had compromised trump during his visits to moscow and could blackmail him it also reported that russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on hillary clinton based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to russia and intercepted phone calls 
the former intelligence officer says the response from the fbi was shock and horror the fbi after receiving the first memo did not immediately request additional material according to the former intelligence officer and his american associates yet in august they say the fbi asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources the former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of trumps inner circle after that point he continued to share information with the fbi its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on he says 
in august corn reports the fbi asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the fbi which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on 
if this report is accurate the spys information confirms what senator harry reid says intelligence experts and fbi director james comey already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between donald trump and russia 
this report also rings true given report about the trump server repeatedly being connected to russia including trumps server possibly communicating with a russian bank 
it also makes sense given the many ties to russia within trumps own campaign and indeed trumps own rhetoric regarding nato and russia trump changed the republican party platforms proukraine proposals and talked about weakening nato both of which mirrored putins wish list nbc reported monday evening that the fbi is in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia 
donald trump has already been busted for reading russian propaganda at his rallies as newsweeks kurt eichenwald uncovered an instance of trump reading propaganda directly from putin at a rally in pennsylvania 
eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the russians have been hacking into american emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election the russians have been obtaining american emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election the big question of course is why are the russians working so hard to damage clinton and in the process aid donald trump 
the answer to why putin is trying so hard to defeat clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her unlike donald trump hillary clinton is no pushover according to former us officials putin sees clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival 
trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the kremlin hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy he is easily flattered and easily manipulated its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the billy bush bus tape of trump bragging about sexual assault trump is easy bait 
the fact that the fbi director felt compelled to announce something about hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates but he chose to keep this explosive information about donald trumps ties to russia under wraps is very disturbing 
this isnt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the fbi follows about ongoing investigations this is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate but the fact that they come from different sources and that trump willingly staffed his own campaign with russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak  these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions",english,politicususa.com,http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-07-07T163623Z_1_LYNXNPEC6616G_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON-COMEY.jpg,bias,trump supporter jailed trying rig election committing voter fraud,letter james comey hillary clinton email scandal motivated democrats clinton campaign says raised million online last hours lisa lerer ap reported clinton campaign says theyve raised online last hrs since clinton became nominee convention lisa lerer llerer november comey letter supposed boost trump depress democratic turnout opposite appears happening james comeys interference presidential election motivated clinton supporters work harder give money get polls republicans wanted democrats seen comeys letter republican spin october surprise failed instead made hillary clinton even stronger giving campaign resources use close presidential election political tactic comey letter harming republicans republicans thrown everything think hillary clinton nothing stopped hillary clinton supporters continue grow stronger donald trump marching back reality television star clist celebrity obscurity,1,Real

russia did hack the democrats so all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the us election 
but fbi director james comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the us presidential election and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan 
republican fbi director james comey advised the obama administration not to publicly accuse russia of hacking the dnc and more on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the nov  election officials familiar with the deliberations told the washington post 
these sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the post on the condition of anonymity 
there are a few reasons why comey might want to keep his agencys investigation of russian interference under the radar but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be reopening its exhaustive investigation of clintons emails which resulted from a republicanled bogus overreaching and seemingly endless benghazi investigation that also cleared clinton it seems odd that comey was going to stay silent on the russia matter 
comeys decisions is especially odd given the reports that the russians have been communicating and coordinating with republican presidential nominee donald trump to the point that he is already compromised 
only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the united states president 
the same sources tell the post that comey made the decision to reveal the clinton emails to congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation 
not sure im buying that because if comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnt have said anything at all but that doesnt mean that his motives were nefarious 
there might well be good reason for this  after all this is the fbi and they cant tell us everything but as of right now comey has mishandled this and appears to be trying to influence an election to help republicans just because he is a republican and just because he has donated to republicans doesnt mean he isnt doing his job properly

the more things change the more they stay the same the house freedom caucus is planning a secret meeting which in typical republican fashion was leaked to the press to discuss ousting paul ryan and demanding more ransom from gop leadership 
politico reported  one of the most pressing questions preoccupying washington is what the group will do about paul ryan the wisconsin republican has said he intends to seek another term as house speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen republican lawmakers that drove john boehner out of the speakership last year the freedom caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members some at the expense of gop leaderships authority 
there have been early rumblings that speaker ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with hillary clinton if she wins the election one of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right republicans to cause trouble 
if ryans republican majority shrinks he will be an even bigger hostage to the farright wing of his caucus the dysfunctional dynamic in the house is going to continue even if hillary clinton wins the election ryan has run into the same hurdles that john boehner faced house republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything 
the fact that the freedom caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change if paul ryan doesnt cave to their demands they will force ryan out of the speaker position 
a group of house republicans is plotting new ways to keep the house from working properly before a new president has even been elected

republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show and nobody noticed the difference 
cnn reported the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners in this case the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire which publishes a mix of true slanted and madeup news then like a game of telephone by the time the story got to hannity even the fake facts were wrong 
some rightwing websites spread the story which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit and to sean hannitys radio show 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the rightwing media echo chamber works nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs so that is what they provide 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true what matters is that the audience wants it to be true 
sean hannity is pushing fake news and he doesnt care 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination

tuesday evening trump made the case that due to the fbis announcement about clintons emails voters might have buyers remorse  a lot of things have happened over the last few days this is a message for any democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for hillary clinton and are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote  wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake 
while its true that people in some states can change their votes its not true that this rule was changed because of hillary clintons emails and yes thats a new right wing thing apparently trump doesnt suggest the law was changed because of clinton but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about clinton because of the nonsurprise october surprise the republican fbi director delivered  which was perceived to have benefited the trump ticket 
days ago snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the fbis bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to clinton 
claim after fbi director jim comey announced that he was reviewing emails potentially linked to hillary clinton several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes mixture 
whats true some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day 
whats false no states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for hillary clinton to change their votes 
and to make this even better that false information was based on a fox news report that wasnt selling the false story about clinton but still got some of the information wrong this is why the right cant have nice things the left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular because epistemic closure leads to losing 
trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping exhaustive list of lawsuits bragging about sexual assault dissing minorities and a gold star family and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaigns ties to russia 
only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a clinton aides emails when they dont even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet

speaking at reverend samuel delevoe memorial park in fort lauderdale tuesday night hillary clinton was interrupted by a donald trump supporter who shouted bill clinton is a rapist he was no doubt working for the  reward offered by infowars but clinton was having none of it rather than ignoring the man she issued a stern rebuke stabbing her finger at the man she said 
you know i am sick and tired of the negative dark divisive dangerous vision and behavior from people who support donald trump 
the man continued to shout waving his sign and the crowd countered with cries of hillary hillary as she said 
it is time for us to say no we are not going backwards were going forward into a brighter future 
the protester was escorted out by security and clinton told the man and everyone like him you may be angry about something but anger is not a plan dont be used dont be exploited 
see the protesters antics here note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by clinton supporters 
sadly all too many angry white christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by donald trump who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the american dream a man whom as clinton says has taken everything and given nothing 
last night in florida hillary clinton was taking nothing and giving everything

ted lieu made the warning in a letter to us secretary of state john kerry and defense secretary ashton carter saying the us governments denial of target selection for saudi airstrikes in yemen does not excuse washington from legal responsibilities 
i find it deeply troubling that the us apparently has no advanced knowledge of what targets will be struck by jets that are refueled by us personnel with us tankers lieu said in his letter 
the us would appear to be violating loac laws of armed conflict and international standards by engaging in such direct military operations if us personnel are not aware if targets are civilian or military if the loss of life and property are disproportional or if the operation is even militarily necessary he noted a yemeni boy walks past a mural depicting a us drone and reading why did you kill my family photo by afp

the ongoing federal investigation into the clinton foundation was expected because of the clinton familys ties with us enemies says scott bennett a former us army psychological warfare officer 
the fbi has been probing possible paytoplay schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is likely to press charges against it fox news reported wednesday citing informed officials 
bennett told press tv on friday that the probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar and many other countries blacklisted by washington 
it was revealed on friday that the clinton foundation took a  million gift from qatar during hillary clintons tenure as the us secretary of state without her informing the state department 
hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state 
according to the foundations website qatar has so far given the clintons a total of between  million and  million over the years 
aside from qatar saudi arabia has also been one of the clinton foundations biggest donors it became known in  that the kingdom had given them between  million and  million 
so those terrorist entities which have been labeled as the enemies of the united states have been appearing as clinton foundation donors bennett said 
that is a serious crime it is treason it is corruption it is bribery of officials said the analyst 
bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the clinton family were coming from those personnel in the american government who have had enough 
they have stepped up they have released emails they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to wikileaks he added 
whistleblowing website wikileaks has released thousands of hillarys campaign chairman and top aide john podestas emails since last month exposing some of the wellkept secrets surrounding the clinton family and hillary clintons bid for the white house

if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare the vermont senator wrote on his twitter page on thursday 
the yearold senator had earlier issued a statement after the new york businessmans victory in the us election on november  promising to work with him on certain issues but also to oppose him should he pursue divisive and discriminatory policies 
to the degree that mr trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country i and other progressives are prepared to work with him sanders said 
to the degree that he pursues racist sexist xenophobic and antienvironment policies we will vigorously oppose him he added 
during the primaries sanders ran a close race with clinton and promised to continue the fight all the way until the democratic national convention in june where the partys nominee was going to be named 
towards the end of the race however sanders changed his tone and bowed out in favor of clinton he also appeared next to her during the dnc and supported his party opponent in the democratic campaigns

on tuesday trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored clinton in the presidential election sending the united states on a new uncertain path 
trump rode a wave of anger toward the elite us establishment to win the white house race against clinton a longtime washington insider 
the new york businessman garnered  electoral votes in the  us election while his rival and the former secretary of state received  votes despite winning the popular vote 
thousands of people since then have rallied in cities across the us to protest against trumps presidential election victory condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against muslims immigrants women and other groups 
this is while trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all americans it is time for us to come together as one united people he said 
the real estate moguls election campaign had been marred by his disparaging remarks against minorities in the us his comments include a call to ban all muslims from coming to america as well as stopping mexican migrants by building a long wall along the usmexico border 
he has also sought for a database to track muslims across the united states and said that the us would have absolutely no choice but to close down mosques

navin nayak the head of the clinton campaigns opinion research division sent an email to senior staffers thursday outlining early signals as to why the candidate lost the november  presidential election politico reported on friday 
we believe that we lost this election in the last week said nayaks email which was published by politico  comeys letter in the last  days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among collegeeducated white voters  particularly in the suburbs 
we also think comeys nd letter which was intended to absolve sec clinton actually helped to bolster trumps turnout he continued 
the letter also highlighted several other challenges the clinton team faced throughout the campaign including a desire for change after two terms by a democratic president and the reluctance of some americans to vote for a female candidate hillary clinton makes a concession speech after being defeated by donald trump in new york on november   photo by afp 
despite those challenges nayak said clinton was on course to win until the last week when everything changed and the momentum began to shift in favor of trump 
voters who decided in the last week broke for trump by a larger margin  these numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states he said 
the fbi director angered democrats late in october by announcing in a letter to congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the clinton email investigation 
just over a week later comey notified congress that clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages 
nayak said comeys letters encouraged trump supporters and depressed the turnout for clinton on election day 
there is no question that a week from election day sec clinton was poised for a historic win in the end less than k votes out of tens of millions cast on election day made the difference in this race he wrote

the american people have repudiated the foreign policy of president barack obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton which was a complete disgrace for the united states according to james fetzer an american scholar and political analyst 
professor fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with press tv on monday days after republican presidential nominee donald trump stunned the world by defeating the heavilyfavored democratic candidate hillary clinton in the november  election 
during the election campaign trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with russian president vladimir putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems including the issue of daesh terrorism which he has blamed on the policies of the obama administration 
on the other hand clinton has shown eagerness to confront russia and continue the interventionist policies us administrations have practiced since  
professor fetzer said that clinton was behind the massacre of libya the butchery of benghazi the transfer of weapons to rebels in syria 
more than five years after the overthrow of muammar gaddafi libya has become a failed state with the central government holding no sway over the country and africas wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations 
and since  the united states and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in syria 
professor fetzer stated that clinton was being advised by israeli intelligence telling her how to conduct american foreign policy it was a complete disgrace

donald trump is going to restore a measure of sanity he is going to end the wars in the middle east he is going to restore the reputation of the united states for integrity and dealing with the international community he noted 
he respects russia as should any president of the united states where barack obama and hillary clinton fell miserably short the analyst pointed out

more than  people had signed the petition as of sunday two days after the government of prime minister theresa may allowed the royal family to repair the palace with public funds 
the uk parliament should discuss the petition when it hits the  mark 
on friday the chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond granted the yearold queen a percent rise in funding required for the palaces refurbishment over the next  years 
the money would be used to replace cables pipes and boilers installed  years ago to prevent a catastrophic event that might destroy the palace according to master of the queens household tony johnstoneburt 
petitioners argued that the royals should foot the massive bill themselves given the vast extent of their wealth 
the crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations wrote mark johnson who posted the petition 
protesters said the money could be used to mend the faltering national health service nhs or help families get more affordable homes amid a housing crisis britains queen elizabeth ii rides a carriage with colombias president juan manuel santos after the ceremonial welcome at horse guards parade in central london november   photo by afp 
it is wholly unreasonable to cut the benefits of the sick and disabled take away housing benefits from the poor and then pay for this said one signatory of the petition 
the antimonarchy campaign group republic also took issue with the announcement denouncing it as a disgrace 
whats worse is this appalling increase is only a small part of the annual cost of the royal family which we put at m said graham smith a member of the group 
over the past years the uk government has been generous towards the royal family despite cutting billions in public money

the top iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world 
unfortunately military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities larijani said

elsewhere in his remarks larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between tehran and helsinki

the accusation was made in the fourth report from the monthlong probe by the united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons 
however the syrian foreign ministry statement said that there was no tangible evidence for the inquirys findings 
syria has repeatedly warned against repercussions of politicizing this issue regarding the credibility of the work of international relevant sides the ministry added 
it also stressed that the syrian government remains committed to all its obligations under the chemical weapons convention a multilateral treaty that bans chemical weapons and requires their destruction 
daesh has frequently used chemical weapons in both in syria and iraq where the takfiri terrorist group is mainly active

the pentagons plan to launch an offensive against the daesh isil terrorist group in syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group says james petras an american political commentator 
us defense secretary ashton carter told nbc news on wednesday that the pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust daesh from the syrian city of raqqah the terror groups stronghold in the country 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared 
he claimed that us forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations 
this is a ploy to have the us in northern syria petras said arguing that the us was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflictridden country 
i dont believe that the attack on raqqah is a positive move because i think it brings the us closer to its policy of establishing a nofly zone in northern syria which will directly affect the efforts of the syrian government and its alliesiran and russiato defend the country 
the analyst noted that raqqah is a problem for the syrian people and damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle

secret peace negotiations between mozambiques opposition leader afonso dhlakama and eu mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the countrys army and former rebel fighters local media say 
the meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in may to find a solution to the conflict between the government and dhlakamas rebel group turned political party renamo 
we had agreed with president filipe nyusi that two mediators would come  to meet me the independent weekly canal de mocambique quoted dhlakama as saying 
dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting 
there was a violent shootout i even heard explosions from here said dhlakama who has been in hiding in the central gorongosa mountains since october  
so i called chief mediator mario raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me he added 
dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was convinced that the ruling frelimo party wanted to capture me during the meeting 
it is obvious they have a plan to kill me he added 
raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an eu diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that two mediators had gone to gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader 
the diplomat said dhlakama had told the mediators to turn back at the very last moment 
the political situation in mozambique has been tense for months with dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the  elections where the frelimo party was declared the winner the party has been in power since the southern african countrys independence from portugal in  dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country 
renamo and the frelimoled government had been engaged in a civil war for  years that was brought to an end in  
renamos armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power

he further noted that the unesco resolution urges respecting the status quo of its religious sites including the alaqsa mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the israeli government and extremist jewish groups

fallon told a nato ministerial meeting in brussels on wednesday that britain would send  soldiers to estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to natos enhanced forward presence in eastern europe 
backed by a rising defense budget this deployment of air land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in nato supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance fallon said 
nato had announced in july that it would deploy on a rotational basis four multinational battalions to poland and the baltic statesestonia latvia and lithuaniato deter what it referred to as any russian incursion 
during his address at the meeting fallon also said that four british typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to romania under the nato southern air policing mission which is supposed to protect the baltic states airspace against possible attacks from russia 
this is about two things reassurance and that needs to be done with some formidable presence and deterrence fallon had said in an earlier interview this is not simply a tripwirethis is a serious military presence 
the move is likely to draw criticism from moscow which has been angered by natos military buildup on its western borders

the alarming surge which surpassed the death toll of  for  comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the mediterranean in  
more than a million people reached europe via the mediterranean in  while fewer than  crossings have been reported so far this year 
the number of refugees heading to europe has declined as the european union in march signed a controversial deal with turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the eu to either be located in turkey or go back to the original country of departure 
since then the route between libya and italy across the central mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to greece have been closed down 
according to the agency the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between turkey and greece was one in  while one death for every  arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between libya and italy in  
the unhcr attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded lower quality vessels flimsy inflatable rafts often used by smugglers in this october   photo provided by seawatch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the libyan coast in the mediterranean sea via ap 
 refugees found dead in mediterranean sea msf says 
earlier on wednesday doctors without borders known as the msf by its french acronym said  bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the mediterranean 
the msf said its ship bourbon argos found the bodies aboard the vessel  nautical miles off libya late on tuesday the vessel was carrying  survivors the victims had apparently been burned suffocated or drowned 
the recovery operation which took place with the help of a team from the berlinbased nongovernmental organization seawatch took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater 
the mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods it was horrible said michele telaro the msf project leader 
the msf also saved  people aboard another dinghy on tuesday seawatch recovered a body in another operation 
the italian coast guard reported that  refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on tuesday

speaking to nbc news on wednesday carter said washington was ready to equip syrian and kurdish fighters to launch the assault in the near future 
it starts in the next few weeks hat has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both groups the pentagon chief noted 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared 
the iraqi army backed by volunteer forces has been engaged in a large military offensive to cleanse mosul of daesh terrorists since last week a coalition of usled countries has been reportedly providing air support to the operation 
its been long a part of our plan that the mosul operation would kick off when it did this was a plan that goes back many months now and that raqqah would follow soon behind carter added iraqi forces gather in the alshura area south of mosul october   photo by afp 
carter acknowledged that us forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations 
more than  american soldiers are currently stationed in iraq tasked with providing training and intelligence to iraqi forces according to us military officials 
the usled coalition has also been carrying out airstrikes against purported daesh positions in syria since  
however the ongoing western efforts in syria have a different nature washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove president bashar alassad from power 
amnesty international a ukbased rights group said wednesday that the usled airstrikes have killed hundreds of civilians across syria 
carters remarks came only a day after british defense secretary michael fallon said uk special forces will soon resume training moderate militants in syria to bolster the fight against daesh 
the new effort would be an extension of a failed  million program by the pentagon that was supposed to train and equip up to  militants every year but was discontinued in november last year after failing to attract enough volunteers

the announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a washington post report on wednesday 
libya has been struggling to contain the daesh takfiri terrorists who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator muammar gaddafi in  
the base has apparently been in use since late june in an alleged effort to support the libyan governments fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of sirte 
the us has also been using bases in niger and djibouti but those ones are farther away 
efforts by the administration of president barack obama to access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small special operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a blind spot for us and western spy agencies 
the officials also asserted that the drones were unarmed and tasked with gathering intelligences adding they could be armed in the future if tunis agrees 
the tunisian government is yet to issue a possible response to the report 
drones tasked with assassination in the north african country usually fly out of naval air station sigonella on the italian island of sicily 
the reason for keeping use of the airbase secret has been mentioned as part of the obama administration efforts not to harm tunisias young democracy as put by the washington post

nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg will discuss the plan for military deployments to the baltic states and eastern poland at a twoday meeting of nato ministers in brussels on wednesday 
the military alliance aims to send battle groups to the baltic states and poland early next year the groups will consist of  forces it will be the biggest military buildup near russia since the second world war more forces would also be deployed if necessary 
this is credible deterrence not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on tuesday referring to the planned deployments near russia concrete proof that nato can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies and a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond

scottish secretary of state david mundell has warned about the consequences of the uks withdrawal from the european union eu saying brexit would cut access to the single market 
mundell told members of the scottish parliament on thursday that neither scotland nor any other part of the uk was going to get a special deal during the negotiations with the eu 
so there are very specific issues to specific industries but there wont be special deals and its absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and scotland will not he said 
i accept on one level if we are leaving the eu then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can i think continue in a way that doesnt involve tariffs or barriers the secretary continued 
british and scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the brexit process with scotland asking for an equal role in the negotiations 
during an eu referendum on june  scotland voted  percent to  percent to remain in the member bloc but britons voted to leave  percent to  percent 
british prime minister theresa may has made it clear that she will complete the brexit process by  and that scotland holds no veto over it 
scotland in response has threatened to secede from the uk in order to preserve its eu membership which in turn guarantees the nations access to the eu single market 
last year scotlands first attempt for independence from the uk was blocked by voters in a referendum 
mundell told msps that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming scottish businesses even more than brexit 
it is already evident because i understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in scotland he said 
experts warn that in case of a hard brexit the uk may lose its preferential access to the eus single market and suffer from soured relations with other eu members loading",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161026/b76571e6-8481-458e-ae4e-88e0bdec3d50.jpg,state,us support emboldens israel defy intl law author,kashmiris observes black day decades india occupied kashmir thu oct pm pakistanis shout slogans support kashmiri people protest lahore october afp javed ranapress tv islamabad kashmiri people observe black day world particularly disputed region divided pakistan india date marks almost decades violence kashmir eve event pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif warned india face serious consequences soldiers stop killing civilians border regions along socalled line control loc divides indiancontrolled kashmir pakistani side loading,1,Real

this is the person who was married to the guy who signed in three strikes and you are out legislation for people to get life in prison if they are convicted of three felonies he said if you look at the things that have been revealed here some of the acts are themselves the violations of three separate federal criminal sanctions 
debar argued that clinton has multiple sets of the triple violations and yet is freely allowed to run for office under federal protection 
clinton and her campaign have repeatedly claimed that russia was trying to rig the november election in favor of republican nominee donald trump 
during the last presidential debate last week clinton accused trump of having secret ties with moscow saying that putin would love to see a puppet in the white house 
debar dismissed accusations against the russian president but noted that since the us was openly seeking regime change in russia it is only logical for russia to fight back

in every election the race tightens towards the end hoenig told press tv on thursday 
its really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other with obama and romney or even gore and bush many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president regardless of who was pulling whose strings he said

mogherini on thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations such as in africa or in the mediterranean and needs to improve command and control centers to run them 
she however attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an eu force could lead to the duplication of nato functions saying but this can be done  without any kind of overlapping or duplication with nato nato secretary general jens stoltenberg r chairs a nato defense ministers meeting flanked by eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini nd l and nato deputy secretary general rose gottemoeller nd r at the nato headquarters in brussels on october   photo by afp 
in july an eu strategy document said that the bloc should look to create greater military autonomy from nato it stated the eu could no longer rely on the alliance regarding various security issues and must instead develop an ability to act autonomously if and when necessary 
european commission president jeanclaude juncker was the first to call for the establishment of an eu army in march  
a joint eu army would show the world that there would never again be a war between eu countries he said 
his suggestion however received a cool response from nato loading",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161026/5f67eb59-4a50-4807-997d-c382d345d8c5.jpg,state,efl cup liverpool beat tottenham reach quarters,iraq leader iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region masoud barzani r talks chairman islamic supreme council iraq isci ammar hakim c zartac mountain near nineveh october photo reuters leader iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region assured kurdish peshmerga forces set foot mosul joint operation army allied fighters aimed liberating daeshheld northern city peshmerga enter city mosul masoud barzani said news conference chairman islamic supreme council iraq isci ammar hakim zartac mountain near city nineveh thursday barzani said kurdish fighters coordinating role mosul liberation operation iraqi military adding collaboration continue kurdish leader highlighted unity among different iraqi political parties adding daesh threat areas back control iraqi forces last week popular mobilization units mainlyshia military group backing iraqi army mosul offensive also said forces would march mosul adding iraqi army soldiers security personnel would enter embattled city barzani referred recent daesh terror activities kurdishcontrolled city kirkuk saying takfiri terror group making desperate attempts cover defeats mosul battle able control situation quickly kill terrorists kurdish leader said terrorists launched several rounds attacks city kirkuk weekend iraqi officials focused mosul offensive friday least daesh elements went rampage kirkuk divert iraqi kurdish military advance mosul incident left civilians members security forces dead well militants according iraqi security officials leader iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region masoud barzani nd l receives chairman islamic supreme council iraq isci ammar hakim nd r zartac mountain near city nineveh october photo reuters part hakim highlighted need avoiding rifts iraq staying focused fight daesh stressed turkish base present bashiqa near mosul welcome turkish base forces came base present without coordination iraqi government armed forces strongly refuse participation noniraqi fighter battle hakim said last december turkey deployed soldiers equipped heavy weapons backed tanks bashiqa camp ankara claimed deployment part mission train equip iraqi kurdish peshmerga forces fight daesh baghdad denounced unauthorized move violation iraqs sovereignty recently ankara claimed country involved mosul operation baghdad denied role last week iraqi army volunteer shia sunni fighters well kurdish peshmerga forces launched longawaited operation wrest control mosul last stronghold daesh arab country many believe recapture mosul fell daesh would signal terror outfits total defeat iraq iraqi special forces commanders said thursday mosul operation proceeding planned waiting gains south resuming push toward city operation stopped proceeding planned special forces brigadier general haider fadhil said another development thursday us estimated daesh terrorists killed mosul liberation operation far general joseph votel head us militarys central command said operation taking heavy toll takfiris daesh elements mosul another broader area according us figures daesh tunnels uncovered also thursday iraqi troops discovered several tunnels used daesh terrorists recently recaptured villages bartella bazwaia located kilometers east mosul entered khazna taba neighborhood bartella liberated found several tunnels said razed qusai alkinani member iraqi counterterrorism forces one tunnels meters long meters deep used daesh meetings allowed terror outfits ringleaders move around battle added elsewhere village tob zawa iraqi troops found tire shop converted factory making roadside bombs attaching armor vehicles also discovered another tunnel village equipped fans lights ran beneath mosque road loading,1,Real

the leader of iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region has assured that kurdish peshmerga forces will not set foot in mosul during a joint operation with the army and allied fighters aimed at liberating the daeshheld northern city 
the peshmerga will not enter the city of mosul masoud barzani said in a news conference with chairman of the islamic supreme council of iraq isci ammar hakim in zartac mountain near the city of nineveh on thursday 
barzani further said the kurdish fighters are coordinating their role in the mosul liberation operation with the iraqi military adding that the collaboration will continue 
the kurdish leader further highlighted unity among different iraqi political parties adding that daesh was no more a threat as most areas are back in control of the iraqi forces 
last week the popular mobilization units a mainlyshia military group backing the iraqi army in the mosul offensive also said its forces would not march into mosul adding that iraqi army soldiers and security personnel would enter the embattled city 
barzani further referred to recent daesh terror activities in the kurdishcontrolled city of kirkuk saying the takfiri terror group is making desperate attempts to cover up its defeats in the mosul battle 
we were able to control the situation quickly and kill the terrorists the kurdish leader said 
terrorists launched several rounds of attacks in the city of kirkuk over the weekend as iraqi officials are focused on the mosul offensive 
on friday at least  daesh elements went on a rampage in kirkuk to divert an iraqi and kurdish military advance on mosul the incident left  civilians and members of the security forces dead as well as  militants according to iraqi security officials leader of iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region masoud barzani nd l receives chairman of the islamic supreme council of iraq isci ammar hakim nd r in zartac mountain near the city of nineveh october   photo by reuters 
for his part hakim highlighted the need for avoiding rifts in iraq and staying focused on the fight against daesh 
he further stressed that a turkish base present in bashiqa near mosul was not welcome 
this turkish base and the forces that came to the base were present without coordination with the iraqi government they are armed forces and we strongly refuse the participation of any noniraqi fighter in this battle hakim said 
last december turkey deployed some  soldiers equipped with heavy weapons and backed by  to  tanks to the bashiqa camp 
ankara claimed the deployment was part of a mission to train and equip iraqi kurdish peshmerga forces in the fight against daesh but baghdad denounced the unauthorized move as a violation of iraqs sovereignty 
recently ankara claimed that his country is involved in the mosul operation but baghdad denied such a role 
last week the iraqi army volunteer shia and sunni fighters as well as kurdish peshmerga forces launched a longawaited operation to wrest control of mosul the last stronghold of daesh in the arab country 
many believe that the recapture of mosul which fell to daesh in  would signal the terror outfits total defeat in iraq 
iraqi special forces commanders said thursday that the mosul operation was proceeding as planned and they were now waiting for further gains in the south before resuming their push toward the city 
the operation has not been stopped and is proceeding as planned special forces brigadier general haider fadhil said 
in another development on thursday the us estimated that up to  daesh terrorists have been killed in the mosul liberation operation so far 
general joseph votel the head the us militarys central command said the operation was taking a heavy toll on the takfiris 
there are between  and  daesh elements in mosul and up to another  in the broader area according to us figures 
more daesh tunnels uncovered 
also on thursday iraqi troops discovered several tunnels used by daesh terrorists in recently recaptured villages of bartella and bazwaia located between  and  kilometers east of mosul 
when we entered the khazna taba neighborhood in bartella and after we liberated it we found several tunnels said razed qusai alkinani a member of iraqi counterterrorism forces 
one of the tunnels which is  meters long and  meters deep was used by daesh for meetings and allowed the terror outfits ringleaders to move around during the battle he added 
elsewhere in the village of tob zawa the iraqi troops found a tire shop that had been converted into a factory for making roadside bombs and attaching armor to vehicles 
they also discovered another tunnel in the village equipped with fans and lights that ran from beneath a mosque out to a road loading",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161026/7ec44dbf-7e22-48fb-8d3d-c8ca1a6d7a55.jpg,state,egypt court upholds life sentence brotherhood leader badie,politics us republican presidential nominee donald trump gestures speaking crowd donors mcglohon theater charlotte north carolina october photo afp us republican presidential nominee donald trump win november election says american professor correctly predicted almost every presidential election united states professor helmut norpoth new yorks suny stony brook university said model shows trump performed comparatively better primaries triumph next month independent reported thursday norpoth developed model applied retroactively successfully predicted every presidential election united states since one election said democratic nominee al gore would beat republican candidate george w bush instead bush election al gore popular vote bush awarded votes electoral college following disputed result florida bush declared winner political scientists model suggests person emerges strongest candidate primaries go win presidency think strongest candidate primaries prevail professor norpoth told new york post model predicted trump win february nothing changed since whatever happens real world doesnt affect model stated us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton professor political science stony brook helmut norpoth new york recent polls show democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton clintons national lead trump shrinking election day approaching former secretary state support percent likely voters billionaire businessman percent support according cnnorc survey released monday addition preliminary figures suggest us presidential race remains tight socalled swing states despite boasting clintons campaign far ahead clinton democratic presidential nominee edge several roughly swing states decide white house race trump also potential advantages battleground states wednesday trump said would win key battleground states ohio florida north carolina could help claim election think im gonna win trump told abc news billionaire said intends pour millions dollars final days campaign loading,1,Real

us republican presidential nominee donald trump will win the november  election says an american professor who has correctly predicted almost every presidential election in the united states 
professor helmut norpoth of new yorks suny stony brook university said his model shows trump performed comparatively better in the primaries so he will triumph next month the independent reported on thursday 
norpoth developed a model which when applied retroactively successfully predicted every presidential election in the united states since  all but one which was the  election when it said democratic nominee al gore would beat republican candidate george w bush but instead bush won the election 
al gore won the popular vote but bush was awarded more votes in the electoral college following a disputed result in florida so bush was declared winner 
the political scientists model suggests that the person who emerges as the strongest candidate in the primaries will go on to win the presidency 
i think he was the strongest candidate in the primaries and that he will prevail professor norpoth told the new york post  
the model predicted a trump win in february and nothing has changed since then whatever happens in the real world doesnt affect the model he stated us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton professor of political science at stony brook helmut norpoth new york 
recent polls show that democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton clintons national lead over trump is shrinking as election day is approaching 
the former secretary of state has the support of  percent of likely voters while the billionaire businessman has  percent support according to the cnnorc survey released on monday 
in addition preliminary figures suggest the us presidential race remains tight in socalled swing states despite boasting by clintons campaign that she is far ahead 
clinton the democratic presidential nominee has an edge in several of the roughly  swing states that will decide the  white house race 
trump has also potential advantages of his own in some battleground states

russia says it has cancelled plans for a fleet of its warships to refuel at a spanish port on their way to syria 
vasily nioradze a spokesman at the russian embassy in madrid said on wednesday that the request was canceled without giving further details the associated press reported 
the spanish foreign ministry also confirmed that russia had withdrawn its request for the warships to refuel in the spanish port of ceuta 
the russian embassy in madrid has just told us that it is withdrawing its demand for permission to stop over for the boats which means that the stopovers have been cancelled the ministry said in a statement on wednesday 
the development came after spain a nato member state said it was reviewing russias request to refuel its naval fleet at ceuta after passing through the straits of gibraltar en route to syria where russian forces are engaged in an antiterror campaign in support of the syrian government 
in a statement released on wednesday the spanish foreign ministry said that spain had been allowing russian navy ships to dock in spanish ports for years but that it treated such requests on a case by case basis 
the naval group which passed through the english channel on friday is made up of russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov as well as a nuclearpowered battle cruiser two antisubmarine warships and four support vessels escorted by submarines 
the fleet will join around  other russian vessels already off the syrian coast 
ceuta sits on the tip of africas north coast across the straits of gibraltar from mainland spain and bordering morocco the port is part of the eu but its nato status is unclear since  at least  russian warships have docked in ceuta 
nato irked by spains announcement 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg claimed that the western military alliance was concerned by the deployment of the russian warships 
it is each up to each nation to decide as has been nato policy for many years but we are concerned about the potential use of this carrier group to increase attacks in aleppo stoltenberg said adding all allies are aware of our concerns 
britain echoes natos stance 
british defense secretary michael fallon also said on wednesday that london would be extremely concerned if spain refueled the russian carrier group heading through the mediterranean towards syria 
nato should be standing together he added 
since march  syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some western states and their regional allies russia has been conducting air raids against daesh and other terrorist groups in the middle eastern country at the damascus governments request for more than a year now 
russia boosts baltic fleet 
in another development on wednesday a report said that russia was reinforcing its baltic fleet in kaliningrad with two small warships armed with longrange cruise missiles to counter a worrying nato buildup in the region 
the report by russias daily izvestia quoted an unidentified military source as saying that the vessels the serpukhov and the zeleny dol had already entered the baltic sea and would soon become part of a newly formed division

iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif says comprehensive international determination is necessary to fight and uproot terrorism in the middle east 
the iranian foreign minister made the remarks at the end of a threeway meeting among him and his russian and syrian counterparts sergei lavrov and walid almuallem respectively in moscow on friday on the latest situation in syria 
zarif said tehran moscow and damascus should reinforce their cooperation in the campaign against terrorism 
he stressed the importance of adopting strategies to stop the delivery of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked takfiri militants wreaking havoc in syria 
the political settlement of the crisis in syria will be possible through negotiations between the sides in order to put an end to this crisis zarif said 
the three foreign ministers agreed to intensify the fight against terrorism and said their countries have a common stance on the antiterror campaign in the region particularly in syria 
lavrov said iran russia and syria have determined necessary frameworks for fighting terrorism and expressed their readiness to take measures that will play a key role in the campaign against the malicious phenomenon 
the russian foreign minister added that the moscow meeting highlighted the significance of a firm and efficient battle against terrorism in the middle east particularly in syria 
he said the meetings participants also discussed ways to send humanitarian aid to civilians in syria and stop the flow of weapons into the hands of terrorists operating in the warhit country 
muallem for his part said the us is making no effort to find a political solution to the syrian crisis 
the syrian foreign minister added that a recent agreement between washington and moscow signed in the swiss city of geneva in september failed to bear any fruit 
after marathon talks in geneva us secretary of state john kerry and his russian counterpart reached an agreement on september  to impose a ceasefire in the syrian city of aleppo and to coordinate military operations against terrorist groups in the country 
aleppo syrias second largest city remains divided between government forces in the west and foreignbacked terrorists in the east making it a frontline battleground 
russia which has been conducting an aerial military campaign against extremist militants in syria has repeatedly voiced its readiness for a ceasefire russia has been insisting however that any such lull in fighting should be accompanied with a meticulous separation of terrorists from less extremist militants fighting against the syrian government 
the syrian foreign minister said washington is not interested in solving the crisis in damascus and takes measures only to serve the its own interests and those of its regional allies 
since march  syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some western states and their regional allies backed by the russian air cover the syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of daesh and other terrorist groups 
the socalled syrian observatory for human rights and united nations special envoy for syria staffan de mistura have put the death toll from the syria conflict at more than  and  respectively 
this is while the un has stopped its official casualty count in syria citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources 
over the past few weeks the syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the wartorn country as they press ahead with their counterterrorism operations 
iran russia share strong antiterror stance zarif 
meanwhile in a meeting with his russian counterpart earlier on friday the iranian foreign minister said tehran and moscow have tough stances in the fight against terrorism in the region through common strategies 
tehran and moscow have broad cooperation on regional issues such as the campaign against terrorism and extremism and we share views on these matters zarif added russian foreign minister sergei lavrov r speaks with his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif during a meeting in moscow russia on october   photo by reuters 
he also noted that iran and russia have succeeded in making considerable progress in all fields including in economic and political sectors as well as regional and international developments 
i am pleased that in recent years relations between the islamic republic of iran and the russian federation as two good neighbors and two key players have made many positive developments zarif said 
lavrov for his part said tehran and moscow urged cooperation on an unrelenting approach to terrorists operating against the syrian government 
iran and russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in syria moscow and tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the warhit country stressing that only the syrians are entitled to decide their own fate

us republican vice presidential candidate mike pence says the mainstream media is biased against donald trump and there are many instances of voter fraud in the run up to the november  election 
republican presidential nominee trump has recently intensified his criticism of the american electoral system he calls the election process rigged and says the media is colluding with democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton in order to win the white house 
he has questioned the legitimacy of the us elections saying that he believed the vote was already being rigged at many polling places 
during his final presidential debate with clinton last week trump declared that he might not accept the results of the november  presidential election if there is evidence it was rigged 
in an interview with cbs news on friday trumps running mate pence said make no mistake about it there are many instances in our lifetimes of voter fraud in individual polling places and in certain jurisdictions 
donald trump and i are just calling on people to respectfully participate in the electoral process we want a victory on election day but we also want it to be a victory for american democracy he stated donald trump speaks at an event on october   in portsmouth new hampshire photo by afp 
the governor of indiana rejected claims of critics that trumps rigging rhetoric may encourage violence by his supporters if he loses the presidential election 
we certainly would denounce any calls for anything other people being vigorously involved in the electoral process he said 
i have to tell you i really dont see it the people that rallying around our team rallying around our cause love this country are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change the gop vice presidential nominee stated 
he went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing clinton 
the level of negative coverage about my running mate in many quarters in the national media has just been overwhelming compared to any negative coverage or frankly the avalanche of scandals coming out of hillary clintons years as secretary of state pence said attendees stand during the national anthem at a rally for republican presidential candidate donald trump at cross insurance center on october   in bangor maine photo by afp

in our first week they called it our introduction they used bamboo to beat us arnel said 
to survive the filipinos did chores for their captors washing their clothes and even their weapons 
we took it as a chance to also wash we couldnt take a bath often because they only gave us a liter of water each day arnel said

that compares to  demolitions in the area last year which left  palestinians without any place of residence 
the newspaper noted that a total of  palestinian homes have also been destroyed in east jerusalem alquds since the start of the year up from  last year 
the demolitions affected  palestinians in the region marking an increase from  the previous year 
the revelations came only two days after israeli military forces razed three palestinian homes in the beit hanina and silwan neighborhoods of east jerusalem alquds displacing at least  people including minors 
international bodies and rights groups argue that israels sustained demolitions of palestinian homes and structures in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem alquds are an attempt by the tel aviv regime to uproot palestinians from their native territories and confiscate more land for expansion of illegal settlements 
more than half a million israelis live in over  illegal settlements built since the  israeli occupation of the palestinian territories of the west bank and east jerusalem alquds 
the presence and continued expansion of israeli settlements in occupied palestinian lands have created a major obstacle for the efforts to establish peace in the middle east

a top official in tehran has accused european government of failing to take the required measures to facilitate trade agreements with iran  what he says is already in violation of a nuclear agreement that was sealed with the country last summer and came into effect in january 
asghar fakhrieh kashan irans deputy minister of roads and urban development told the financial times that european government should prevent the inclusion of what he described as very exceptional terms and conditions in trade agreements with iran 
fakhrieh kashan warned that such terms and conditions were effectively discouraging investments in the iranian economy 
he said export credit agencies were specifically demanding premiums on insurance that made banks insist on putting what he described as unacceptable terms in contracts related to political risk in doing business with iran 
fakhrieh kashan emphasized that iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against iran 
european businesses he said are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks  what he said is totally rejected by the islamic republic 
if anyone needed guarantees against political risks it was iran fakhrieh kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the iranian economy 
why should iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with european companies this is not called a normal relationship he said 
fakhrieh kashan emphasized that european countries should take the adequate measures to prevent their businesses from including political risk in contracts warning that any failure to do so will be against the nuclear agreement with iran 
this is where european countries are failing to be committed to the nuclear agreement one of the main reasons the signing of contracts in various sectors has been delayed is this issue 
last summer iran signed a historic deal with the us britain france russia china and germany  the socalled p group  based on which it agreed to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear energy activities the p in return agreed to lift certain economic sanctions imposed against the islamic republic loading",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161027/e7f303d5-ab26-41ea-b5cf-f9f92625bfec.jpg,state,indian princess watches rare paleontological remains,eu refugees wait disembark ship october palermo italy photo afp refugees died across world since beginning says international organization migration iom organization based geneva said friday total deaths people died trying cross mediterranean sea boat indicating person increase compared wednesday united nations high commissioner refugees unhcr made different account deaths mediterranean since january also noting new record compared asylum seekers trying reach european union died libyan shores recently according iom eu said thursday begun training libyan coast guard curb influx asylum seekers today starting training libyan coast guard operation sophia important step said eu foreign affairs chief federica mogherini arrived meeting nato defense ministers brussels nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said western military alliance launched operation sea guardian mediterranean help support operation sophia eu launched operation sophia last year hundreds asylum seekers died rickety boats sank southern italy central mediterranean route seen asylum seekers risk lives recent months eu reached accord turkey march halt influx refugees crossing aegean reach europe stoltenberg said within two weeks ships aircraft would provided nato allies help back operation sophia loading,1,Real

former british prime minister tony blair says britain should keep its options open on whether or not to leave the european union until after brexit talks with the bloc are completed 
during an interview on friday with bbc radio s today program blair described the eu referendum as a catastrophe and said uk voters should be given the option of a second eu referendum 
britain should not withdraw from the eu until it becomes clearer how brexit would impact uks economic social and cultural future blair said 
the bizarre thing about this referendum is that we took a decision but we still dont know the precise terms he said theres got to be some way either through parliament or through an election possibly through another referendum that people express their view 
the former premier who was in office from  until  said it should be possible for the public to switch their verdict if it becomes clear the alternative negotiated by prime minister theresa may is going to be worse 
blairs argument contrasts sharply with that of may who has repeatedly said that brexit means brexit and that shell respect the referendum result blair had argued that britain should stay in the eu before the referendum

the fourth high criminal court of bahrain has sentenced  political opponents to long jail terms and also revoked the citizenship of all of them while several international rights groups have criticized the al khalifa regimes harsh crackdown on the bahraini opposition the western powers turn a blind eye to the arab states violations of human rights 
edward corrigan an international human rights lawyer told press tvs top  program that the western powers are trying to whitewash the crimes committed by the arab dictatorships in the persian gulf region because such regimes are considered the wests lap dogs 
there is a double standard corrigan said explaining that western powers say if you are a friend of ours and do what we want and give us oil and invest your money into european or american economy we wont question your human rights violations 
according to the analyst there is hypocrisy double standards and this is really a big political game our dictatorships and allies are ok but somebody else that we dont like for whatever reason we magnify their crimes and even create false flags and do other things to try to discredit them 
elsewhere in his remarks corrigan said the definition of terrorism in bahrain covers any kind of opposition because the regime does not want to allow any sort of political movements there to try to reform the system to redress this massive discrimination against the shia population and to have any sort of voice for democracy so all of that is terrorism 
he added it is against the international law to remove peoples nationality from them and this is an extreme sort of punishment very draconian as theyre condemned by the international human rights organizations and other organizations

foreign ministers of iran russia and syria have started trilateral talks on a political solution to the syria crisis besides a serious fight against the takfiri terror groups operating in the arab country 
on friday iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and his russian and syrian counterparts sergei lavrov and walid muallem gathered in moscow for a threeway meeting 
ahead of the meeting lavrov said the three nations are acting as a united front against terrorism saying their talks are mainly focused on ways of seriously tackling terrorism particularly in syria 
the three sides lavrov added will exchange views on humanitarian operations as well as efforts to stop the flow of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked militants operating against the damascus government 
prior to the threeway discussions zarif held a bilateral meeting with lavrov to discuss regional issues and the further enhancement of bilateral tehranmoscow ties russian foreign minister sergei lavrov r welcomes his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif during a meeting in moscow on october   photo by afp 
upon his arrival at vnukovo international airport in moscow on friday morning zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping syria 
unfortunately some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in syria this is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also entails battles against takfiri groups said zarif 
he added we have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an allout ceasefire humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the syrian issue 
following the trilateral talks the three ministers attended a joint press conference 
during the presser muallem slammed the usled coalition purportedly fighting daesh saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims 
he said the washingtonled campaign was in fact encouraging daesh terrorists to move from iraqs mosul to syrias raqqah 
mosul and raqqah have served as the main daesh bases in the middle east over the past years iraqi and syrian armed forces are engaged in largescale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities 
the syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with iran and russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism 
muallem described the atmosphere of the talks in russia as positive and very comfortable 
we in syria have become convinced of the sincerity of the russian and iranian efforts in helping us rout terrorism he added russian foreign minister sergei lavrov c syrian foreign minister walid almuallem r and iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif attend a news conference in moscow russia october   photo by reuters 
zarif in turn described the talks in moscow as very productive saying iran and russia have developed very close relations in different areas 
commenting on the situation in syria the top iranian diplomat said syrias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected adding that it is up to the syrian nation to determine its own destiny and that the voice of the syrians must be recognized 
he further highlighted the need for a political settlement of the crisis adding that tehran backs the resumption of peace talks between the syrian government and opposition 
the iranian minister called for a ceasefire in syria joint battles against terror groups as well as efforts to facilitate aid delivery to syrian civilians in besieged areas 
he said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism which poses a threat not only to syria but the entire world 
zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one warning that the terror groups would eventually bite the hands that feed them 
for his part the russian foreign minister also touched on the mosul battle in iraq saying that iraqi citys liberation from daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring syria 
lavrov said the political settlement in syria should be achieved through dialogue according to the security council resolutions welcoming syrias readiness to resume the stalled talks with the opposition 
referring to the situation in aleppo lavrov said terrorists blocked the exit routes opened as part of a syrian humanitarian pause and prevented the civilians from leaving the eastern neighborhoods of aleppo city 
the senior russian official also criticized the international organizations for failing to fulfill their duties towards the locals of eastern aleppo 
lavrov emphasized that the fight against terrorism in syria will continue adding that future common steps in this regard during the moscow talks

been used to blow up two moscow blocks the residents are evacuated then the bomb carted away and turned over to the fsb in an apparent oversight the fsb fails to collect the detonator which is photographed by the local police the following morning september  the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted they praise the vigilance of the local people and the ryazan police

in the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the clinton campaign and the doj among the recent batch of hacked emails released by wikileaks we learn that the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta hillarys campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik  who is currently a top official at the us justice department serving as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs 
peter kadzik with lobbyist tony podesta brother of john podesta  
the postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant the dinner was set for  that evening just one day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee  
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  another email sent on may    kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
as the daily caller notes  the dinner arrangement is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices as one former us attorney tells told the dc the exchanges are another example of the clinton campaigns cozy relationship with the obama justice department 
the hacked emails confirm that podesta and kadzik were in frequent contact in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
 its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton  he added comparing the podestakadzik meetings to the revelation that attorney general loretta lynch met in private with bill clinton at the airport in phoenix days before the fbi and doj investigating hillary clinton 
kadziks role at the doj where he started in  is particularly notable kadzik as helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
a long friendly history 
podesta and kadzik have a long history one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal as dc helps summarize kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who  kept me out of jail 
as the dc chuck ross notes it is unclear to which case podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison but podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the lewinsky affair and the rich pardon scandal as deputy chief of staff to clinton in  podesta asked thenunited nations ambassador bill richardson to hire the yearold lewinsky  in april  the white house transferred lewinsky from her job as a white house intern to the pentagon in order to keep her and bill clinton separate but the clinton team also wanted to keep lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with clinton 
richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered lewinsky the position but that she declined it 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
kadziks current role 
in his current role as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation  
in a feb   letter in response to kadzik florida rep ron desantis noted that kadzik had explained that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the attorney general when an investigation or prosecution by the department of justice would create a potential conflict of interest 
desantis a republican suggested that lynchs appointment by bill clinton in  as us attorney in new york may be considered a conflict of interest he also asserted that obamas political appointees  a list which includes kadzik  are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states

top nato  eu officials expressed anger at spains permit reportedly issued to a russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at ceuta a city with unclear political status spain says russias warships have been mooring there for years 
a barrage of harsh statements followed when spanish media reported that russias naval battle group led by aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of ceuta after passing the straits of gibraltar on wednesday 
battle stations putins fearsome fleet locked loaded  ready for war with britain or not 
russian ships would moor in ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by spains foreign ministry spanish newspaper abc reported on tuesday also citing defense minister pedro morenes who said that there was a prior authorization for this particular case 
guy verhofstadt former belgian prime minister and currently eu envoy for brexit talks with the uk expressed his outrage calling spains decision the harassment of eu and nato forces 
in a facebook post he said that nato member spain provides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose adding that only last week this spanish government signed up to a statement from the european council accusing russia of war crimes against civilians in aleppo 
later in the day nato secretary general jens stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants madrid to rethink the stopover permit a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
we are concerned and i have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase russias ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against syria he said 
this is something i have conveyed very clearly before and i repeat those concerns today and i believe that all nato allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against aleppo and syria 
he then downplayed the rhetoric noting that its for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern mediterranean 
late tuesday night the spanish foreign ministry said it was reviewing the decision the latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from russian authorities the ministry said in a statement quoted by reuters 
earlier in the day however the ministry told ria novosti that madrid allows russian ships to dock in spanish ports as routine navigation which effectively lies outside eu sanctions imposed on moscow 
in the meantime a spokesman for the foreign ministry told the telegraph the requests from the russian navy are considered on casebycase basis stressing that russian navy vessels have been making calls in spanish ports for years 
ceuta an autonomous spanish enclave on the tip of africas northern coast lies along the straits of gibraltar and borders morocco which also claims the territory as its own 
although ceuta is part of the eu its status within nato is still unresolved since  spain has rankled the bloc by allowing  russian warships to refuel at the enclave 
the mission of the admiral kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across europe with british norwegian and dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the russian warships as they round european shores through international waters 
once they reach syrian shores the ships will provide backup for russias naval standing group already deployed to the area according to the russian defense ministry this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161027/e5008532-7e71-45a6-b394-cf401500d7da.jpg,state,knifewielding man shot dead outside us embassy nairobi,uk express october european leaders controversial statements reportedly included hollande saying justice system full cowards many immigrants problem islam mr hollande also spoke harshly senior politicians book released intended make public desire run presidency blamed us president barack obama creating isis saying dont know would happened carried strikes say carry strikes theres daesh party members giving leader following hapless blunder party scrambling pick pieces looking prime minister manuel valls disliked party segolene royal environment minister ex partner mr hollande equally unsuccessful electoral races political scientist bruno cautres im stunned speed collapse article posted wednesday october share article,1,Real

around  civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the usled coalition in syria which amnesty international investigated for its latest report amnesty says the us must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against islamic state 
amnesty suspects that us central command centcom which directs coalition airstrikes in syria may have carried out unlawful attacks in syria failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings 
we fear the usled coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in syria said lynn maalouf deputy director for research at amnesty internationals beirut regional office 
its high time the us authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in syria independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public 
amnesty investigated evidence including eyewitness accounts reports by human rights organizations and the media photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery related to  suspected coalition attacks in syria the group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as  civilian lives so far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by centcom 
the report published on wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action could be as high as  or more than  since the operation against islamic state is formerly isis isil started in syria in  
one of the strikes investigated by amnesty took place in the early hours of december   the attacks hit two houses in the village of ayn alkhan near alhawl in alhasakah governorate in northern syria killing  civilians including  children and injuring at least  others the report said a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
according to an eyewitness account an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors 
at this point i had a twomonthold baby boy in my arms whom i had rescued the hit caused me to fall and drop him i fell into the hole made by the air strike that was what saved me my mother aunt wife and children  a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed the woman and her son who id rescued were killed everyone but me was killed the survivor said 
the strike is believed to have targeted is fighters but local kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area 
amnesty said centcoms failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in syria as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in afghanistan and iraq poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of mosul iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from is the usled coalition is providing air support for the offensive 
given the likely increase in air strikes by the usled coalition as part of the iraqi offensive to recapture mosul it is even more pressing that centcom be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians and it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure said maalouf 
a similar operation to capture manbij syria which is far smaller than mosul killed more than  civilians amnesty estimated 
last week amnesty international blasted russia for civilian deaths in aleppo the syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups including the alqaeda offshoot alnusra front russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city derailing several attempts by russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",english,presstv.ir,http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161027/cd274c19-9d86-4f78-a26d-a9f49cf96c68.jpg,state,us hacking hysteria aimed distracting voters putin,prison planetcom october infowars reporter owen shroyer speaks trump supporter attacked hillary zombies polling station austin texas article posted wednesday october share article,1,Real

mr hollande also spoke harshly about senior politicians in the book which was released just as he intended to make public his desire to run for the presidency again in  
he blamed us president barack obama for creating isis saying i dont know what would have happened if we had carried out strikes what i can say is that we did not carry out strikes and theres daesh

wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behindthescenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in american history 
remember the first debate between hillary clinton and donald trump and the conspiracy surrounding podiumgate  
hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didnt want to appear shorter than trump 
after the debate was over however a sneaky cleaner man was caught on tape approaching hillarys podium multiple times removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it what could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in trumps just after the debate officially ended 
this led to lots of speculation on whether or not hillary cheated during the first debate against trump and other debates as well having her comments fed to her 
well if the wikileaks podesta emails are any indication its very possible why a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
because apparently hillary cant give long speeches without a podium 
in fact these emails and this isnt even all of them but enough for you to get the picture prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept short and sweet unless hillary has a podium

one of norways nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine monday morning according to the norwegian radiation protection authority nrpa  
in a statement released today the nrpa said 
the radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall emissions are low 
experts say contamination levels around the institute for energy technology in the southern town of halden were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public 
said per strand deputy directorgeneral at the nrpa a government regulator 
of course its an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk this is not the sort of leak we want  
the radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility 
staff were evacuated from the institute but later returned donning protective gear to assess the cause and extent of the leak and halt it 
a senior nrpa official said the incident would maybe be rated a  on the international nuclear event scale which rates nuclear incidents from  to  by comparison the incidents at fukishima and chernobyl were ranked   source the government of the hong kong special administrative region 
regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today  atle valseth a research director at the institute for energy technology agreed he said 
i dont sit so close to those decisions but i think we should have informed the authority yesterday we will have to go through why it wasnt reported  it wasnt good enough that we didnt report it yesterday  
strand the head of safety preparedness and environment at the nrpa expressed the regulators frustration 
we need to gather more information  but we are not happy with the situation that we were not warned immediately we will investigate further  
the swiss radiation safety authority srsa said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility which sits close to the swiss border 
mark foreman a nuclear expert at the chalmers university of technology in sweden stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel which is contained within a ceramic material the ceramicwrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut the tube is inside the reactor 
the iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall

butbut i thought we were trying to help people 
obamacare visionary jonathan stupidity of the american voter gruber is back when last we heard from the man with the same name as the die hard villain he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was  
an architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a lack of transparency and the stupidity of the american voter helped congress approve obamacare in a clip unearthed sunday massachusetts institute of technology professor jonathan gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass 
he suggested that many lawmakers and voters didnt know what was in the law or how its financing worked and that this helped it win approval lack of transparency is a huge political advantage gruber said and basically call it the stupidity of the american voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was written in a tortured way to avoid a bad score from the congressional budget office he suggested that voters would have rejected obamacare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes either by budget analysts or the public if cbo scored the individual mandate as taxes the bill dies gruber said 
now the gruber is back and ready to explain why the only problem with obamacare is the lack of severe beatings  
there is no sense in which the law has to be fixed the law is working as designed however it could work better and i think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty we have individuals who are essentially freeriding on the system theyre essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance the whole idea of this plan which was pioneered in massachusetts was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate the penalty right now is probably too low and thats something i think ideally we would fix 
ideally we would penalize gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public but predictably grubers proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves while pretending that anyone who isnt on obamacare is just a free

Paul Kengor,2016-10-27T12:05:00.000+03:00,tom hayden from sds and viet cong to progressives for obama,"search the left in power  clinton to obama david horowitz explains how the democrats became a leftwing party in volume vii of the black book of the american left october   richard baehr 
below is richard baehrs review of david horowitzs new book the left in power clinton to obama reprinted from american thinker with permission the book is volume  of the black book of the american left  a multivolume collection of david horowitzs conservative writings that will when completed be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the left and its agenda order here  we encourage our readers to visit blackbookoftheamericanleftcom which features horowitzs introductions to volumes  of this volume series along with their tables of contents reviews and interviews with the author 
every year there is some report of the blissful ignorance of american history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite american universities suffice it to say the collected writings of david horowitz on the american left which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of american politics are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list 
horowitzs latest book the left in power clinton to obama  is the seventh volume in his ninevolume collection the black book of the american left  this new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century focusing primarily on the lefts control in our government and culture as horowitz reveals even during the bush years conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy bush and his chances for reelection in  their primary mode of attack was to undermine americas efforts in iraq almost from the start of the conflict when just months earlier a majority of senate democrats and near half of house democrats had supported the president the left then destroyed bushs second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of hurricane katrina there was plenty of incompetence in the response to katrina but local and state officials  all democrats of course and many of them african american  were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis 
the immediate abandonment of support for the iraq war effort was a signal event in american history sending a message that a large part of the democratic party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas the weak effort by some democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve  end the war support the troops  was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces so too the obsession with abu ghraib gave the lie to the democrats support our troops message as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis 
horowitz outlines this narrative faulting the bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into iraq and the risks if we had done nothing regrettably the bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the iraq war out to the media most in the media considered the bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the  presidential contest a lie to be sure  unfortunately it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the lefts agenda the soft liberalism of walter cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side during the current presidential election cycle we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year it is a special time they argue because trump is in their view a unique threat to the republic 
on the other hand the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by barack obama  the loss of respect abroad for americas will to fight the degradation of our military readiness the fraying of ties with allies and the near obsessive outreach to americas enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with iran best described as an abject surrender of american interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime about  of those supposedly sensible proisrael democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal with no visible regrets to date there was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party the media were happy to parrot the administrations talking points for the nuclear deal something the manipulators crowed over at the white house 
at least in the propaganda use of abu ghraib the left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military as horowitz outlines in article after article the left is fighting a war that most americans do not see disguising its intentions through its aggressive unceasing promotion of progressive policies to make america a better place this commitment to deception emerges horowitz reveals from the allegiance to the ideology of saul alinskys rules for radicals a formative doctrine for both barack obama and hillary clinton the progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe in america the left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public but also horowitz argues it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing one prime example was the admission of mit professor and obamacare architect jonathan gruber that health care law would never have made it through congress if it had been presented honestly 
the left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically horowitz provides chapter and verse on the lefts efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool  motor voter registration with no birth certificate required fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and turning the clock back even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register support for open borders expansion of legal immigration and amnesty and citizenship and voting rights for more than ten million already in the country illegally here the lefts mentor and financier is george soros and his buddies who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically and horowitz has done a great public service by his discover the network listing of the people responsible for americas steady drift to the radical left 
the left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates of course the problems of americas inner cities all under complete control of one political party for half a century have never been of even near equal interest to the democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters particularly african americans the left has fully endorsed the teacher unions opposition to charter schools and voucher programs though both are popular with minority group parents and children the two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the democratic party campaign cash votes and volunteers for the left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce 
in the last two years the sorosfunded black lives matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year many of them in situations where the victims were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them  michael brown in ferguson is a prime example one wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks perhaps because there are no riots or looting these incidents have no cachet more likely they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current president to hillary clinton 
in chicago in  months this year over  blacks mostly men have been shot and killed almost exclusively by other black men by year end over  chicagoans will have been shot one might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in charlotte chicagos mayor says that police have gone fetal avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods with the aclu looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by chicagos mayor to protect his reelection bid rahm emanuel must also have read alinsky for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost the victims of the police pullback in chicago baltimore st louis and other cities called the ferguson effect are many more dead black men killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the s even the fbi director admits the ferguson effect is real when not covering for hillary clinton 
horowitz latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the left and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century he provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the new york times and there is always a horrible slur available from the left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions the left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it it argues that these are people horowitz included unworthy of serious consideration or respect 
silencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the left so far horowitz keeps writing and america is free enough that the left though it clearly wants to cannot ban his books george soros and his family have another  billion to spend on changing america the alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an america where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth so results are all equal and we can all sing along with the pete seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil and disinvest in defense every year 
lets hope that some of americas young will read horowitz booksand learn what their professors and teachers wont teach them",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/screen_shot_2012-10-29_at_3.04.49_pm_2.png?itok=vGN8KmL9,hate,obamacare great need punish people using,search replace isis war determine whether future belong west islam october daniel greenfield daniel greenfield shillman journalism fellow freedom center new york writer focusing radical islam long administration declared fighting iraq several times claim victory isis timetable push islamic state appears less victimized christians yazidis prevented coming refugees favor syrian muslims clinton presidential campaign like obamas declarations wars afghanistan iraq announcement isis defeated premature based profound misunderstanding misreading islamic terrorism long current string defeats isis begun evolving another al qaeda multinational alliance jihadists scattered around world bombing mosul isnt hard try bombing marseille brussels london doubt ability isis temporarily establish caliphate allowed build network could carry terror attacks new york miami nice munich would dangerous assume losing iraq syria stop isis isis doesnt matter idea isis idea isis islamic supremacism organization think isis transformed rebranded countless times even leaders vacillate calling isis isil childishly daesh dubs islamic state fighting one form another decade would unrealistically optimistic assume war end old enemy shown ability strike deep cities bigger error though think fighting organization fighting idea contend obama debate death sort idea argues words bullets bombs swords neither go away seize city al qaeda iraq survived death zarqawi became even dangerous baghdadi would risky assume isis die instead may well grow new phase al qaeda one ties together worlds deadliest islamic terror groups network decentralized enough suffer al qaedas leadership fatigue rise islamic terrorism incremental process new groups learn mistakes old supersede isis recede localized oblivion reemerging occasion suicide bomb something someone baghdad deadlier even effective group likely take place group move one step closer realizing caliphate break cycle must confront idea caliphate heart islamic terrorism isis unislamic ruthlessly uncompromisingly islamic unlike predecessors muslim brotherhood al qaeda makes fewest compromises civilizational sensibilities goals every islamic political organization including dubbed moderate seeks restore enforce islamic system every part muslim world moving conquer subjugate nonmuslim world merely fringe belief held tiny minority extremists could bombed pieces syrian iraqi backwater driving force islam thats wont go away amount appeasement banish taking muslim settlers pressuring israel letting muslim brotherhood colonize foreign policy wont weve tried actually makes islamic terrorism much worse announcement made usual suspects pat back defeated isis mobilizing muslim coalition wasnt obama mobilized muslim coalition coalition mobilized obama provided useful support islamic state sponsors terror iran turkey assorted islamic jihadists ground blatantly associated sunni shiite terror groups internal jihadist conflict isis fight us allies aiding today ones bombing us tomorrow claiming credit beating isis accomplishes nothing isis expression islamic impulse encoded koran islamic groups differ tactical expression impulse isis nastier uglier islamic terror groups dealt though even found boko haram affiliate nigeria occasionally little much stomach isis vanishes world stage islamic terrorism easier dismiss thinking goes islamic state better viral videos media tried whitewash islamic terror hard ignore scattering islamic terror groups around world forgotten public history suggests thats wishful thinking islamic terrorism shown signs receding growing muslim populations home muslim settlements west increase travel communications infrastructure globalism spread backward advanced parts world wealthy unstable muslim countries rich oil poor power finance spread mosques guns ingredients give us isis combination letters stands islamic terror anything meaningful would reverse decline west islam originally spread vacuum created civilizational decline civilizational decline rising obscure local terror group eventually turned isis filling power vacuum even obama performs another touchdown dance group making journey mission familiar one replacing civilization come terms civilizational struggle go fighting endless wars sand coping endless terror attacks cities failed recognize nature enemy fighting acronym whether isis isil fighting islamic state war determine whether future belong west islam,1,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T21:12:14.598+03:00,obama votes against us at un,"an eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute october   matthew vadum 
the obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect democrats according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute 
during eric holders term as attorney general from february  through april  a little under  billion was paid by us banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but  million of that sum came from three big settlements bank of america citigroup and jp morgan chase 
many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas regardless of the reasons for the disparity 
instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks the money flows to leftist allies of president obama 
adding insult to injury the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the money how the department of justice funds progressive activists bestselling clinton cash author and anticorruption crusader peter schweizer is gais president the full page report is available in pdf form here  
the report states 
the department of justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority 
it adds these funds directed by the doj effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress 
much of the cash moves through neighborworks the nonprofit gave more than  million to the rabblerousing group neighborhood assistance corp of america naca whose leader bruce marks calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over  million to asian americans for equality aafe an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north korean sympathizer 
the illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as national council of la raza nhs of chicago national urban league and operation hope 
many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats 
catalist a george sorosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive the report states 
catalist was founded by former bill clinton aide harold ickes in  following democrats electoral wipeout in  leftwing activists believed republicans owed george w bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology including databases 
according to a capital research center report  
catalist boasts it was vital to president obamas  victory by its own admission over  organizations campaigns and committees used the companys services based on data that was loaded into the catalist databases and then standardized a catalist analysis of the  cycle says progressive organizations the obama campaign and federal party committees attempted to contact more than  million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over  of the us adult population contacts were delivered inperson over the phone by mail and over the internet 
of course leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like george soros and michael bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal state and local levels 
the report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist 
in other words the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of america there is no level socalled playing field in american electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else 
conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half century the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical subversive causes in the united states 
changes in federal social policy in the mids helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing under the profoundly antisocial war on poverty the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since  to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say america declared war on itself and conscripted saul alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left  including groups like acorn and moneygrubbing con artists like jesse jackson sr  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests 
conservative groups receive no such largesse from uncle sam and in fairness many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it 
this sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if hillary clinton becomes president secretary of labor tom perez  no stranger to the shakedown business himself is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new clinton administration perez who previously ran the dojs civil rights division is also a past president of casa de maryland a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by george soros and the late venezuelan strongman hugo chavez 
the moneyraising scam described in the gai report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts 
activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the carterera community reinvestment act which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone but banks that didnt got their legs broken 
few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of  were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination 
leftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was and is pure gangsterism through the magic of dysphemism the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending 
the shaking down of lenders intensified when thentreasury secretary robert rubin presided over the clinton administrations effort to put the cra on steroids banks began to make risky subprime loans and fannie mae and freddie mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities these practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of acorn and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers fannie and freddie which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market 
president clinton turned the community reinvestment act a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law into one of the most powerful mandates shaping american citiesand as senate banking committee chairman phil gramm memorably put it a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks howard husock of the manhattan institute wrote in city journal  
when husock wrote in  us banks had committed nearly  trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups intent in some cases on teaching their lowincome clients that the financial system is their enemy and implicitly that government rather than their own striving is the key to their wellbeing 
enterprising leftwing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes 
and they never will",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hans-looking-die-hard-hans-gruber-18648743-1280-720.jpg?itok=O3M-HMzn,hate,left

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-28T03:32:38.137+03:00,obamacare is great we just need to punish people for not using it,"search what will replace isis this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam october   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
before long the same administration that declared the fighting in iraq over several times will claim victory over isis the timetable for its push against the islamic state appears to have less do with the victimized christians and yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of syrian muslims than with the clinton presidential campaign like obamas declarations that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were over the announcement that isis has been defeated will be premature 
it is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of islamic terrorism 
long before its current string of defeats isis had begun evolving into another al qaeda a multinational alliance of jihadists scattered around the world bombing mosul isnt hard but try bombing marseille brussels or london there is no doubt that the ability of isis to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from new york to miami to nice to munich but it would be dangerous to assume that losing iraq and syria will stop isis 
isis doesnt matter the idea of isis does and the idea of isis is islamic supremacism 
the organization we think of isis has transformed and rebranded countless times even now our leaders vacillate between calling it isis isil or more childishly daesh while it dubs itself the islamic state we have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade it would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities 
the bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization we are fighting an idea that is not to contend as obama does that we can debate it to death it is not the sort of idea that argues with words but with bullets bombs and swords but neither does it just go away if you seize a city 
al qaeda in iraq not only survived the death of zarqawi but it became even more dangerous under baghdadi it would be risky to assume that isis will die with him instead it may very well grow into a new phase of al qaeda one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from al qaedas leadership fatigue 
the rise of islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them if isis does recede into a localized oblivion reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in baghdad then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate 
to break the cycle we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of islamic terrorism 
isis is not unislamic it is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly islamic in that unlike its predecessors in the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities its goals are the same as those of every islamic political organization including those dubbed moderate it seeks to restore and enforce an islamic system in every part of the muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonmuslim world if this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists then it could be bombed to pieces in some syrian or iraqi backwater 
but its the driving force of islam thats why it wont go away no amount of appeasement will banish it 
taking in more muslim settlers pressuring israel and letting the muslim brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it weve tried it and it actually makes islamic terrorism much worse 
when the announcement is made the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated isis by mobilizing a muslim coalition but it wasnt obama who mobilized a muslim coalition the coalition such as it was mobilized them obama provided useful support to islamic state sponsors of terror such as iran and turkey assorted islamic jihadists on the ground some blatantly associated with sunni and shiite terror groups in their internal jihadist conflict with isis over who will fight us 
the allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow 
and that is why claiming credit for beating isis accomplishes nothing isis is an expression of an islamic impulse encoded in the koran islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse isis was nastier and uglier than most of the islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this though even it found its boko haram affiliate in nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach 
if isis vanishes from the world stage islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss or so the thinking goes the islamic state was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash islamic terror it was hard to ignore but a scattering of islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public 
history suggests thats wishful thinking 
islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding growing muslim populations both at home and in muslim settlements in the west and the increase in travel and communications the infrastructure of globalism spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world wealthy and unstable muslim countries rich in oil but poor in power finance its spread through mosques and guns 
these are the ingredients that give us isis or any other combination or letters that stands for islamic terror to do anything meaningful about it we would have to reverse the decline of the west 
islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline civilizational decline is why it is rising once again an obscure local terror group eventually turned into isis by filling a power vacuum even as obama performs another touchdown dance some other group will be making that same journey its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own 
until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy we are not fighting an acronym whether its isis or isil we are fighting an islamic state

Richard Baehr,2016-10-28T07:54:59.211+03:00,the left in power clinton to obama,"the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists equating counterjihadists with jihadists robert spencer 
the objective of this libelous new report from the hardleft moneymaking and incitement machine the southern poverty law center splc is made plain within it before you book a spokesperson from an antimuslim extremist group or quote them in a story research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to  of the most visible antimuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform 
they wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat blaming us for a supposed rise in islamophobia if they really want to stamp out suspicion of islam of course they will move against not us but the likes of omar mateen syed rizwan farook tashfeen malik nidal malik hasan mohammed abdulazeez dzhokhar tsarnaev and the myriad other muslims who commit violence in the name of islam and justify it by reference to islamic teachings 
the splc doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop islamophobia at all but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of islamophobes who can only be stopped if you write a check to the splc thats what this is really all about 
in constructing this illusory edifice the splc labels me and fourteen others antimuslim extremists we are of course no more antimuslim than foes of the nazis were antigerman but note the word extremists thats the mainstream media and obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists in what way are we extremists has anyone on the splcs hit list and given the splcs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up beheaded anyone boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people no all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and sharia oppression the splc is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonmuslim bin ladens and awlakis until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the splcs libel is only that a libel 
its also passingly ironic that the splc list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as islamophobes but their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the index of prohibited thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings 
the report as a whole stands as an example of the lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why apparently the splc knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts 
the splcs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false for example it says that ann corcoran of refugee resettlement watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps this is a case that corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the splc doesnt bother to try disproving it says that steven emerson of the investigative project on terrorism has claimed that the obama administration extensively collaborates with the muslim brotherhood that he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them as andrew c mccarthy has noted  barack obama has spent his presidency cultivating islamists particularly from the international muslim brotherhood and its affiliates in the united states the splc also hits emerison for having asserted that europe is riddled with nogo zones regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks 
germany police sick of citizens nogo zone fears 
the splc excoriates brigitte gabriel of act for america for saying that any practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah  who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day  this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the united states yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the quran that contradict american constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more how to reconcile these teachings with us citizenship the splc did not bother to explain 
the splc quotes david horowitz saying there are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the democratic party even those who are antiterrorist here again no refutation is offered  yet the lefts dalliance with palestinian jihad groups and overall antiamericanism make it impossible to dismiss horowitzs assertion 
frank gaffney of the center for security policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about muslims destroying the west from within the splc doesnt bother to mention the explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the brotherhood in north america  the captured muslim brotherhood internal document that explained that brotherhood members must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions 
in attacking pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative the splc descended to outright fabrications notes geller  their claim that i insist that obama is the love child of malcolm x is patently untrue the splc also states that i have spoken to a neofascist group in germany when in fact i have never even been to germany it characterizes former fbi agent john guandolos claim that cia director john brennan was a convert to islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a us asset assigned overseas with brennan in saudi arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that brennan was indeed the target of a saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion brennan has also stated publicly that he visited mecca which is impossible for a nonmuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the saudi king 
even more strangely the splc targets ayaan hirsi ali a woman who grew up as a muslim in somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of muslims is under death threats from muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of muslims instead of trying to discredit her the splc should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against sharia oppression but the splc has other priorities 
of me the splc concedes that i am a real intellectual but complains that i am entirely selftaught in the study of islam an odd objection one cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual in any case its false i am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct nonetheless the fact is that i did first read the quran and began studying islam in earnest while at the university of north carolina my claims says the splc are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them 
it even says that i have referred to barack obama as the first muslim president this one epitomizes the dishonesty of the splc the quote comes from an article i wrote in  discussing how obama was not a muslim stating that his obvious affinity for islam and the muslim world could make him into our first muslim president the way bill clinton was called our first black president after eight years of obama id say i was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion 
the splc finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict muslims in a positive light 
the facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the splc george soros funded a report on islamophobia on twitter and gave  to the center for american progress for a defamatory report on alleged islamophobes he also spent  for favorable coverage of the muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the iran deal  and bought islamophobia propaganda after the san bernardino jihad massacre 
but what need does the splc have of facts it knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the splc is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant left those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the splc feels bound to respect",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/dj.jpg?itok=FOQTWxFX,hate,replace isis,muslim bloc may battle israel win

Matthew Vadum,2016-10-28T07:54:59.346+03:00,bank fines elect democrats,"the psychopathic and insincere jihad islams natural appeal to criminals psychopaths and murderers october   
raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
whenever muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow muslims islams apologists loudly proclaim aha see theyre not true muslims or in the words of cia head john brennan on the islamic state they are terrorists theyre criminals mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct 
overlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs murderers some may not even believe in allah at all yet this does not exonerate islam for its religious construct was designed to entice such men 
as usual  this traces back to the prophet muhammad after telling his followers that allah had permitted muslims four wives and limitless concubines koran  he later claimed that allah had delivered a new revelation koran  permitting him muhammad alone to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted in response his young wife aisha quipped i feel that your lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires apostates from islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet 
but it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites for whoever fights in the name of allah andor seeks to empower islamthat is jihadisterroristsis exonerated of all blame and if he dies fighting guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits 
thats because allah made a pact with them according to koran  allah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them paradise they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain rejoice then in the bargain you have struck for that is the supreme triumph muhammad elaborated lining up for battle in the path of allah jihad to empower islam is worthier than  years of worship moreover the martyr is special to allah he is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds he sees his throne in paradise he will wed the aynhour supernatural celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains and he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour 
as for those muslims who reject jihad muhammad said they will be tortured like no other sinful human for many more islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise see here  
there is no denying that the historic growth of islam is related to its carnal incentives after more than a decade of preaching in mecca muhammad had about  followers mostly relatives it was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied so long as such fighters helped spread the banner of islam into infidel lands they were deemed good and pious muslimsregardless of their true intentions priorities or even faith 
many of the original jihadis now revered in islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics consider khalid bin alwalid a meccan pagan he opposed muhammad for years but when the prophet seized mecca khalidlike many of muhammads foes such as his archenemy abu sufyanexpediently converted proclaimed the shahada  joined the winning team and then went ajihadingmutilating plundering raping enslaving crucifying and setting people on fire in the process but because he did so under the banner of jihad this serial killer and rapist is today one of islams most revered heroes 
the reason for this is that nowhere in islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart or if hes right with god allah is not god he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords so long as his fighters proclaim the shahada there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messengerand fight under the banner of islam they can take plunder murder and rape the infidels and if they die doing so they go to paradise 
such was the genius of muhammad in the arabian society he lived in members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all muslims regardless of raceand the infidels who deserve to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity for rejecting allah 
this explains why other tribalnomadic societiesturks and mongolstatars whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to islam and under the banner of jihad continued preying on the other the infidel but now as venerated champions of the faith 
christian europe was aware of islams true appeal from the very beginning theophanes the byzantine scholar d  wrote the following about muhammad in his chronicles he taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see koran  and he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating drinking and women also there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring eg koran     and all sorts of other nonsense 
centuries later st thomas aquinas d  made similar observations he muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us his teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure in all this as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men as for proofs of the truth of his doctrine muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants what is more no wise men men trained in things divine and human believed in him from the beginning those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers utterly ignorant of all divine teaching through whose numbers mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms 
there is finally another group of muslims who should not be overlooked these do not give a fig for allah nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise but they rely on islam to justify robbing enslaving raping and killing nonmuslims as many christian minorities in nations like pakistan and egypt will attest because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonmuslim against a muslim that is a nontribal member against a tribal membermuslim criminals target nonmuslim minorities precisely because they know muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels 
in short enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is in the words of the cias brennan terrorists criminals psychopathic thugs and murderers yes they are but that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife but knows that as long as they only victimize infidels no muslim will hold them accountable in both cases islam aids and abets their behavior",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/ds_2.jpg?itok=eeogWH7x,hate,splcs libelous new report antimuslim

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-28T07:54:59.950+03:00,what will replace isis,"the muslim bloc may have won the battle but did israel win the war october   ari lieberman 
by now it should be clear to all but the blindest or rabidly disingenuous that the united nations is an organization that has been coopted by the nefarious interests of muslim nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as todays greatest purveyor of judeophobia historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco that deny the indisputable jewish nexus to the holy city 
on april  the member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly onesided resolution that referred to jewish holy sites in jerusalem exclusively by their muslim names and designated the temple mount judaisms holiest site as a muslim holy site of worship to add insult to injury the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that israel was planting jewish fake graves in other spaces of the muslim cemeteries 
unsurprisingly the resolution which was submitted by seven muslim nations passed by a wide margin with  votes in favor six against and  abstentions two nations were absent for the vote france sweden slovenia and spain shamefully supported the vile resolution 
that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of unesco but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner european support and israel could thus claim a moral victory france with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble 
but following the vote a crack appeared in the façade of antiisrael invective so prevalent at the un it appeared that france was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the french parliament prime minister manuel valls termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that france will never deny the jewish presence and jewish history in jerusalem it would make no sense it is absurd to deny this history 
france is one of europes strongest advocates for the palestinians the palestinian authority and their muslim allies at unesco should have understood from valls statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic european support instead of declaring victory and moving on they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in october 
the october  resolution  sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the april resolution it condemned israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the jewish and christian nexus to the city this time however the muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution passed the muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the member body 
of the  nations that voted in favor of the resolution mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to   were composed of states with muslim majorities while a fifteenth nigeria is  percent muslim making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time around the resolution failed to garner a single western european concurrence other developing nations like india which had hitherto supported arabsponsored drafts also abstained israels behindthescenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the muslim initiative was paying dividends 
following the resolutions passage the palestinians and their muslim allies suffered additional political reversals mexico  asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion mexicos secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of mexico gives the undeniable link of the jewish people to the cultural heritage of east jerusalem 
brazil soon followed suit echoing mexicos position in a statement the brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such onesided resolutions italy which had abstained went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister matteo renzi told an italian radio station that these resolutions were incomprehensible unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness 
even unescos directorgeneral irina bokova voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion 
on wednesday the palestinian authority and jordan introduced a third draft resolution to unescos world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites the member whc body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move croatia and tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the muslim bloc instead of the motion passing by consensus the vote was  in favor two opposed eight abstentions and one nation absent 
the two nations opposing were tanzania and the philippines of the  ayes seven were muslim it was a pyrrhic victory at best 
given the large number of muslim countries represented at the un and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against israel it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent arab political reversals gone are the days that the palestinians can rely on automatic european and nonaligned support 
israel has been effectively reaching out to the socalled nonaligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the israeli success lies in the fact that the jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology agriculture energy counterterrorism cyber warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the un 
nevertheless the unesco resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many un member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to israel that it will never allow the un to impose terms and dictates on israel 
there have been rumors circulating that barack obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on israel utilizing the un security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation 
the administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed antiisrael resolution likely introduced by france or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying longstanding commitments to israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition the notion that the united states would throw israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant antisemitism to have a say on israels fate is beyond asinine hopefully the outrageous conduct exhibited at unesco steers the administration in the right

Robert Spencer,2016-10-28T07:55:00.267+03:00,the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists,"originally published by the jerusalem post  
in one of the immortal lines of godfather   mafia boss michael corleone discusses the fate of his brother who betrayed him with his enforcer i dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive corleone said 
message received the brother was murdered after their mothers funeral last week it was reported that the obama administration has delivered a message to the palestinian authority the administration has warned the pa that the us will veto any antiisrael resolution brought before the un security council before the us presidential elections on november  message received open season on israel at the security council will commence november  the palestinians are planning appropriately israel needs to plan too israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank president barack obama in his final eight weeks in power lobbying the administration is pointless obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on israel for not supporting his hostile strategically irrational policies and he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones before turning to what israel must do first we need to understand what israel can do a good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at unesco where twice in a week unesco bodies resolved to erase  years of jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount the fight that israel waged at unesco is not the fight it needs to wage at the security council the stakes at the security council are far higher like the un general assembly unescos decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance as such there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them for israel the goal of the fight at unesco is not to defeat antiisrael initiatives that is impossible given the palestinians automatic majority the purpose of the fight at unesco is to humiliate european governments that side with antisemitic initiatives and to weaken the congenitally antiisrael body itself the government achieved both of these objectives italian prime minister matteo renzis disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for israel so too the fact that unescos own secretarygeneral irina bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the jewish peoples ties to jerusalem was a significant victory for israel her statement was deeply damaging for unesco and its reputation finally the fact that tanzania and the philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional propalestinian voting pattern the palestinians won the vote at unesco because they are more powerful diplomatically than israel they have an automatic antiisrael majority but they werent empowered by their victory to the contrary they were bloodied by it in a sign of their weakening hold on member nations the palestinians and jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of unescos world heritage committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution powerful players dont make threats they dont need to israels experience at unesco teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers israel doesnt need to hide in americas shadow it is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the palestinians automatic majority and it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a usbacked assault at the security council unlike unesco the security council can pass legally binding resolutions israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it obamas intention to abandon israel at the security council means that israel comes to this battle severely hobbled but there is one advantage to the uss betrayal over the years israels ability to trust the us to veto antiisrael resolutions at the security council was been a mixed blessing on the one hand the us has secured israel from diplomatic assaults but on the other hand our ability to trust washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective safe in washingtons shadow we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy that is we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys but public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool the syrian regime for instance has no moral case for securing international support bashar assad didnt convince russian president vladimir putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes he bought putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in syria then there is morocco another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make last march un secretarygeneral ban kimoon outraged rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that western sahara which morocco occupies is occupied territory morocco quickly secured the support of spain and france and launched an allout onslaught against ban how did morocco manage moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from north africa to europe anytime it wishes rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut and the french and spanish know it in less than a month ban issued repeated abject apologies game set match morocco from reports to date it appears that shortly after the us elections on november  the malaysians or egyptians will submit a palestinianbacked resolution that defines israeli communities in united jerusalem judea and samaria as illegal if the resolution is brought to a vote the us will fail to veto it such a resolution or a resolution obligating israel to withdraw to the  armistice lines would cause israel grave harm so what resources does israel have to prevent this from happening of course we have public diplomacy and that might work with some friendly nations but it wont get us over the top we need to learn from the syrian and moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer security council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us one such resource is the us congress israels allies in congress are sickened by the obama administrations devastating middle east policies a solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce israels position israel has other resources as well that we can trade on we have natural gas and we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the  century there is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support as for the palestinians as the unesco vote showed they are less popular now than at any time in the past  years all they have to offer is threats and antisemitism both are powerful weapons but they are no longer invincible israels goal must be to use our resources at the security council in a manner that will make it impossible for obama to enable an antiisrael resolution to pass a method for achieving this goal has two components the first component is to convince a friendly country on the security council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the palestinianbacked israelbashing one such a resolution could include four points first it could deplore efforts to deny jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount second it can condemn the paplo for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists third it can urge israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future palestinian state fourth it can call on israel and the pa to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions israel has friendly ties with a few security council members among them uruguay and new zealand in the final weeks of the obama era it is possible that israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines obama would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles israel out for rebuke but that still is insufficient obama can make uruguay and new zealand a better offer if he wishes and so we move to the second aspect of the plan if we learn nothing else from the obama era we must recognize that the time has come for israel to stop sufficing with just one security council veto most states have several and we need a few more russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto putin is a dealmaker as his agreement with assad showed he is willing to consider attractive offers obviously israel wont offer russia bases but we do have other things to offer putin in exchange for a veto for instance in exchange for a russian veto at the security council israel can offer putin to lobby the us congress to cancel us sanctions against russia over russias annexation of crimea israel has no dog in that fight and the sanctions are not getting the us anywhere putin might go for the deal for two reasons first by stepping into the breach and defending israel against obama he will humiliate obama second if israel succeeds with the congress he will reap economic rewards for his part putin wouldnt even have to openly side with israel all he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on israel and the palestinians if putin supports a balanced resolution obama will be checkmated his plan to take revenge on israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled israel will have survived his presidency none of this will be easy and success is far from assured there are many more ways for israel to fail than succeed our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck but as the unesco resolutions showed attacking israel is no longer cost free we are not powerless in the grip of circumstances we have cards to play and now is the time to play them for all they are worth",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/lp_1.jpg?itok=3ClxpnGN,hate,battle unesco,feminists learn melania trump

Raymond Ibrahim,2016-10-28T07:55:00.777+03:00,the psychopathic and insincere jihad,"a look at the universitys new mission october   jack kerwick 
jonathan haidt a professor of social psychology at new york university argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth within the last few decades the university has assumed another social justice 
the university however can only have one telos 
the conflict between these two goals has raged for decades haidt claims last year though it became unmanageable when student groups at  universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators demands for social justice that by and large were met 
the following statement is posted at blackliberationcollectiveorg  
we demand at the minimum black students and black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of black folk in the state and the country 
we demand free intuition for black and indigenous students 
we demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities 
a statement of principles follows the black liberation collective blc opposes antiblackness sexism ableism capitalism white privilege inequality and heteronormativity it rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic  
antiblack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society says the blc when social systems are racialized by white supremacy whiteness becomes the default of humanity and blackness is stripped of its humanity becoming a commodity becoming disposable 
the blc is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men 
black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy 
presumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases 
these social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks 
nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression 
it isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles 
the state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty 
concerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it 
haidt misspeaks in characterizing  as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out 
perhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors 
to put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors 
leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals 
for all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the  critical race theory  to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a  th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men 
but theres more to it than this 
the idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted 
yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american 
the social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the  th or early  th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor 
now they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in social justice",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sw.jpg?itok=bxOjUWH-,hate,checkmating obama,search zineb el rhazoui charlie

in recent interviews donald trumps wife melania trump observed wryly that almost every malicious liefilled article about herself or he husband was written by a  female indeed women seem to have a particular stake in bringing mr trump down 
the contrast between mrs trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark in both her interviews with cnns condescending anderson cooper and fox newss ainsley earhardt mrs trump was the embodiment of strength 
when a liberal woman declares shes a strong woman usually uttered in a tartlike staccato inflection shes using a cliché look at her actions youll see that strong to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways 
a strong liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to forkout for her trojans and her trivora and if birth control fails our liberated libertine then youre on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients and dont dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man any man to doubt her is to harm her 
it was not without significance that hillary clintons first general election speech in june was before planned parenthood at the time media buried the story of one named rajiv k fernando  who had donated to the clinton foundation and was given a seat as hillarys nuclear weapons advisor watching this i was thinking endemic corruption the  trillion debt the dire jobs report the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers but hillary and her gynobrigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayerpaid dilation and curettage dc 
melania trump on the other hand is authentically strong 
in her refusal to impart salacious tellall tidbits to interviewers in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family in her serene gracious and beautiful manners and bearingmrs trump exemplifies a european womans good breeding shes a class act her enemies are the cultural underclass 
nor does mrs trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her american counterparts there are images on the internet of presidents being inappropriate with women in particular you can watch a grainy youtube clip of barack obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters in another the president with frances nicolas sarkozy is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by much to media chagrin melania refused to get worked up about the  access hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in lockerroom talk 
men will be men if theyre not saying it theyre thinking it 
more material than her mien were melania trumps words of reason on the sovietstyle witchhunt launched against her husband with media mediation she said this all sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law to accuse someone man or woman without evidence is damaging and unfair this was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney tom mesereau about the bill cosby pileon quit the feeding frenzy give the man his due process investigate the women counseled mesereau esq at the time 
the very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted michelle obama the first lady was lauded for an unhinged antitrump address to the nations women in a world where americans have been beheaded on camera women raped en masse on europes streets and christians exterminated in the middle eastthe first lady bewailed being shaken to her shallow core by raunchy words i cant stop thinking about it groaned michelle about mr trumps access hollywood indiscretion it has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted 
the ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a catholic priest by muslim migrants in france thats something i cant stop thinking about the machinegunning of five macys shoppers and employees by a turkish muslim immigrant arcan cetin in my neck of the woods that has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted again mrs obamas pitiful case against mr trump has strengthened nothing but her dramaqueen credentials 
candidate clinton crowed that mrs obamas long whinge for women was a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election about who we are as americans indeed the implicit case michelle put to women is this a mammoth national debt a shrinking job market rising lawlessness and racial strife an annual intake of mostly thirdworld immigrants exceeding  million the dangers to life and limb of importing more islam fuhgeddaboudit what counts whimpered michelle obama voice tremblingyes mrs obama almost brought herself to tearswas to ferret out microaggression and find a safeplace to hunker down 
as i write sen elizabeth warren has stormed a stage somewhere for hillary clinton phony pocahontas is hollering about the power of nasty women to immiserate clinton and warren make for a resentful domineering powerhungry pair whove made it big in life through the use of state power the human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same 
whereas trump rallies are packed with hopefilled beaming faces a clintonwarren affair is festooned with malevolentlooking aggrieved women and their frightened lowt houseboys the background music enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop singer like katy perry whose outoftune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard if not for the marvel of autotune autotune is the holy grail of recording that corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments in real time without distortion or artifacts it was invented by a male engineer

sweeping in to the offices of women in the world in manhattan accompanied by bodyguards the worldrenowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep living her life beyond its limits as a key way of resisting terror elegant and beautiful with her long wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress el rhazoui is reminiscent of s cinemas cerebral heroines  her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past  months each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in islamic civilization she is fearless 
in this spirit el rhazoui obliged to spend most of her time in hiding like salman rushdie after his  publication of the satanic verses  has taken the highrisk option of publishing an explosive new book about islam 
detruire le fascisme islamique  destroy islamic fascism  being released in france this week takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologicallydriven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend charb stephane charbonnier late editor of charlie hebdo who preferred to die standing than to live on my knees 
obtained exclusively by women in the world the book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam by imitating the first salafists or pious ancestors the prophet mohammed and his companions whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric thcentury bedouin tribal context exhibited codes of behavior el rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism the most abject crimes of islamic state are but a stcentury remake of what the first muslims accomplished under the guidance of the prophet she writes noting that sexual and domestic slavery the massacre of nonmuslims notably jews pedophilia pillage polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from preislamic societies the book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with islam no exception to their traditional french anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature 
formerly the magazines religion writer el rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management flush with cash from international donations the fundamentally altered publication she disappointedly explained  will probably never again draw the prophet  out of fear of more reprisals 
and those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of mohammed forget that everywhere that islam reigns as the religion of the state caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed el rhazouis book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam religion of peace and love 
we need to admit that islamism today is applied islam el rhazoui  who describes herself as an atheist of muslim culture writes responding to politicians religious figures islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real islam has nothing to do with such terror 
when we apply islam to the letter it gives islamism and when we apply islamism to the letter it gives terrorism so we need to stop saying islam is a religion of peace and love what is a moderate islamist an islamist who doesnt kill 
the essaylength book is in the grand french polemical tradition of emile zola whose jaccuse denounced the antisemitism of the french state and establishment during the dreyfus affair on the eve of the th century el rhazoui who holds moroccan and french citizenship takes aim at a very stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of islamophobia which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all muslims epitomized by the french collective against islamophobia ccif this deliberate strategy vilifies as islamophobic voices such as el rhazouis who dare question the religion the ccif and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism 
the notion of islamophobia doesnt even exist in muslim countries the author points out because outside the west criticism of the religion or mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy 
unable to pass blasphemy laws in europe groups like the ccif employ a dangerous semantic confusion she said on the ccif site it is written islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense 
this is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards islam and muslims yet criticism of an idea of islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime i was born and lived under the islam of morocco and live in france and i have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of islamophobia that says i have no right to criticize if we criticize christianity it doesnt mean we are christianophobes or racist towards the christian race 
the widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe el rhazoui says 
you can no longer speak about islam without saying its a religion of peace and love but when you open any book in islam what do you find violence blood oppression of women and hate for other religions 
of course you can find this in other religions however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity as long as we dont talk about this and keep repeating that islam is a religion of peace and love many people will continue to believe the koran is a constitution and that rather than being a book written  centuries ago reflecting a particular context it is a legal constitution to apply today 
zineb el rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead charlie hebdo comrades 
after completing high school in morocco el rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion obtaining a masters degree from pariss prestigious social science graduate school ehess in her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at le journal hebdomadaire becoming a campaigner for secular liberties such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of ramadan this act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the arab spring in  the wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against ramadan rules prompted her to leave morocco again for france where she began to report for charlie hebdo bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being muslim is not a choice unless youre jewish or christian 
extreme personality cult 
socalled islamic fascism seen in its most extreme form in groups like isis shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms el rhazoui argues because it combines an intense personality cult around mohammed as the incarnation of the nation it also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation exemplified by sartorial branding  for example burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents there are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals armed militias adoption of a flag and a strategy that confers the benign status of muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the west and characterizes them disingenuously as victimized objects of exclusion 
the literary corpus of islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma el rhazoui writes 
if the terrorists of daesh isis behead those they judge to be miscreants that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the th surah of the koran alanfal verse  remember what your lord revealed to the angels  i am with you so support those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve you can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip 
you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of islams core arabic texts the politics of the postarab spring middle east and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted islamic civilization el rhazouis book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead 
the greatest racism is el rhazoui argues the racism of the islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not muslims and that rejects women that is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it the writer adds 
today islam in the world only has a role as a civilization a civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage its artistic culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature 
the muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women sexual and individual freedom and equality for all no matter your creed or religion until islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it islam will not be acceptable 
islamophobia whiners 
destroy islamic fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left cryptoislamist antiracists on a quest for a new muslim proletariat certain feminists cultural relativists and socalled moderate imams all these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of islamic state the author says but also makes the lives of millions of muslims living in islamic countries downright miserable 
what do these islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in islamic theocracies and dream of liberty el rhazoui concludes in her book who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of algiers casablanca or cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals pariahs of muslim societies who often only have the choice of death prison or exile who speaks about this youth born muslim but dreaming of a normal life these teens attacked for having had a romance 


the summer furore over burkini bans in france agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of islamists and their western sympathizers in the media academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by muslim women even though most never wear it 
western media in an intolerable readiness to oblige have defended the burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity she said but pointed out that in muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with burkinis but they are emptying themselves of women from one year to another they are disappearing from the public space because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior 
as for mainstream or moderate muslim clerics el rhazoui tells women in the world that during the burkini debate in france not one imam stood up and said hey wait a minute you can be muslim and wear a regular bathing suit 
history will judge those who have monopolized the debate given a platform to islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability the author of destroy islamic fascism told women in the world this is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today she said 
according to the writer who is repeatedly accused of bigotry the islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of islam and what islam with a big i is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within 
the accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people no fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history the people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability 
for el rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to islamic culture that decrees an islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa we present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture it is absolutely intolerable she says 
survivor syndrome 
women in the world asked el rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since january  
it is a question people often ask me she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice but when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death you realize can put many things in perspective 
straight after the attacks like many of my colleagues i felt guilty for having stayed alive i said to myself those who are dead are dead for all our work and some are dead when it wasnt even their work but it was my work because i am a journalist and i am still here and then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome which is normal when you survive a massacre like that 
as you start to heal you say i am lucky to be alive and if i am still here perhaps that is because i still have something to do i understood long before the attack on charlie when i engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in morocco that when you fight against totalitarianism whether it is political or religious you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living we fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life 
zineb el rhazoui c attends the funeral of french cartoonist and charlie hebdo editor stephane charb charbonnier on january   in pontoise outside paris martin bureauafpgetty images 
still a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague charb and their many heated discussions 
he was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear he was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd 
el rhazouis deconstruction of islam is also a defense of muslims she reasoned as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it 
we have to extend a hand to all these muslims who are free people who have questioned their heritage and who are fighters for liberty battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by islamists she says 
life in a moving jail 
since january  the survivor from charlie hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the freedom forum in europe and the us under the protection assured by the french state and the countries that receive her she says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security 
i always find some spaces of freedom there are always little escape hatches life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since the charlie attacks and recently became a firsttime mother in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in french media 
today i wander around in a moving jail  its a moving cage  but in reality i am more free in my head than those who threaten me because their cage is inside their head they have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned i am much freer than them

Jack Kerwick,2016-10-28T07:55:05.430+03:00,social justice vs truth,"propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere october   
reprinted from israelnationalnewscom  
commendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted 
the bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks 
it has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point 
an islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity 
this is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight 
the bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution 
in  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier 
by the late s edward saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations 
i only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel 
as we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired 
such lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink 
a likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why 
the two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care 
fair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either 
heres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity 
he would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible 
his mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do 
i am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult 
facts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming 
this is one of our greatest challenges",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nm_1.jpg?itok=2YWPFbXh,hate,zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses world needs destroy islamic fascism,hillary clinton seeks even unfit secretary state october daniel greenfield never read medieval german folk tales hillary clinton counting chickens theyve hatched preparing hand jobs one handed hand shes busy planning fantasy cabinet fantasy administration big pick makes sense reportedly would like make joe biden secretary state biden obvious choice hes arrogant dumb brimming bright ideas like giving iran money splitting iraq little pieces obviously wouldnt competency pick last time someone qualified secretary state president bushs time office democrats decided would give job consolation prize failed presidential candidates foreign policy important could counted make even bigger mess hillary clinton john kerry joe biden perfect plan want fall guy blame everything dont come obvious joe biden want someone shadowed soft bigotry low expectations youve gotta go joe joe biden could accidentally start ww everyone would shrug say thats joe,1,Real

theres only one possible solution 
lets load  million in unmarked foreign currency on an unmarked cargo plane and deliver it to iran then make follow that up with a few more and make sure iran scores  billion in sanctions relief 
thats how we got here  its smartpower which is neither smart nor powerful 
earlier this month us navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from houthicontrolled yemen 
this was likely the first time in history the navy had to take such measures and officials are now saying they think iran is behind the attacks 
we believe that iran is connected to this vice admiral kevin donegan told nbc news in fact the us has intercepted many shipments of weapons from iran to the houthi militants who oppose yemens internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population 
the intercepted shipments were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles boats that we believe were explosive boats other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw donegan said 
im sure theres no chance that the billions obama lavished on iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own jihadi candy store not a chance

obama inc has a lot more luck with the media than it does with trials its lynchings of police officers have not gotten very far baltimore was the biggest and most resounding defeat but it wasnt the only one and the vastly differing treatment of the bundy protesters and the dakota pipeline protesters from killing to government backing have not had their intended effect 
instead obama lost at trial again 
this time its the bundy case that was when the left realized it hated civil disobedience just before rediscovering it again when it came to environmental protests but big gov lost this one  again 
a jury thursday delivered a stunning acrosstheboard acquittal to the leaders and participants in the malheur national wildlife refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a nevada family to open public lands to ranchers miners and loggers 
the verdicts finding ammon bundy older brother ryan bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a timehonored tradition of first amendment protest and civil disobedience 
the highprofile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon the jurys decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the landrights movement 
it means that big green gov will have to think twice next time around or do a much better job of picking a jury 
the oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss us attorney billy williams and the head of the fbi in oregon greg bretzing as the judge announced the not guilty pleas one by one

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-28T14:52:36.662+03:00,us navy iran giving terrorists missiles to fire at us ships,"hillarys secretary of state after  send a check for  million to iran   
were talking about tehran joe biden of course who is good pals with the iran lobby biden is reportedly hillarys fantasy cabinet pick for secretary of state because the democrats have decided that secretary of state is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates 
heres a flashback on bidens views  
democratic vicepresidential candidate joe biden was quoted monday as telling senior israeli officials behind closed doors that the jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear iran in the unsourced report army radio also quoted biden as saying that he opposed opening a additional military and diplomatic front army radio said israeli officials expressed amazement over the remarks attributed to him israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran army radio quoted biden as telling the unnamed officials 
bidens people loudly denied the report but he had a history of being tight w ith the iran lobby 
some might call it reaching out to american muslims but to many iranians living in california a fundraiser for sen joseph biden ddel at the home of a prominent proiran lobbyist on feb  sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in tehran 
when we learned that sen biden was planning to hold a fundraiser at the california home of dr sadegh namazikhah we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay a prominent iranianamerican activist tells insight why dismay 
dr namazikhah is wellknown in the los angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in tehran and is one of the regimes leading unofficial lobbyists in america we thought that sen biden might not know his background getting the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in tehran as a show of support 
on the eve of the fundraiser which brought an estimated  into bidens reelection coffers a biden staffer told the activist that the senators staff had all the facts necessary to make a decision and he was planning to attend the fundraiser despite the protests 
several participants who paid to attend the event tell insight that biden arrived at  pm stayed until  and delivered a sweeping condemnation of president george w bushs axis of evil formula 
as senator biden was not only undermining bush but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state 
biden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the islamic republic of iran the senator said that iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the us according to housang dadgostar a prominent lawyer as iranianamericans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism says mohsen movaghar a los angeles businessman both men belong to the member board of directors of namazikhahs iranian muslim association of north america iman 
namazikhah denied any official contact with the iranian government but he tells insight that he regularly travels to iran  something many expatriates do  and that he actively supports moderates within the ruling clergy such as iranian president mohammad khatami in their efforts to bring reform to the islamic system 
namazikhah and other iman board members say bidens office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fundraiser for the senator who is up for reelection this year after meeting with them at a protehran gala in new york last december that event was sponsored by the americaniranian council aic a proregime lobbying group trying to get congress and the bush administration to lift the trade embargo on iran 
but biden had the perfect post  reaction  
after september th biden suggested sending  million to iran no strings attached as a gesture of good faith to the arab world 
at the tuesdaymorning meeting with committee staffers biden launches into a streamofconsciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious im groping here then he hits on an idea america needs to show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran biden declares 
he surveys the table with raised eyebrows a how do ya like that look on his face

the giant flaming garbage dump that is clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the weiner scandal and the hillary email scandal 
yes virginia you can now have both of them in one like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one theyve been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic 
the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  apparently during the probe of former rep anthony weiners sexting  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation 
comey did not detail those emails saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case 
an fbi source though confirmed to fox news that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced rep weiner and his wife huma abedin a top clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman the new york times first reported on the weiner investigation connection noting the fbi had been probing texts weiner sent to a yearold girl 
as donald trump and congressional republicans seized on the fbis decision interim democratic party leader donna brazile simply tweeted good grief after the news of the anthony weiner connection broke 
cant argue with her there 
it would be hilarious if anthony weiner and thereby huma abedin led to the downfall of hillarys lifelong ambition you just know someone is going to commit suicide in a dc park

you may remember ambassador samantha power from the time she proposed invading israel since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the castro regime at the un or is it the obama regime it naturally gets confusing when the us ambassador to the un sides with the enemy against her own country 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust

attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates disagreed with fbi director james comeys decision to notify congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to hillary clintons personal server law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said 
there was no direct confrontation between lynch or yates and comey instead the disagreements were conveyed to comey by justice department staff who advised the fbi chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election the officials said 
it is in line with policy though for lynch to have met with bill clinton

jon tester didnt come all the way from montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon the us senator virtually unknown in boston was in a conference room at the thornton law firm that june morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the democratic fundraising circuit a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians 
tester a massive jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys but the drill was basically the same the personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes then returned to their offices and tester walked away with  in checks 
but a striking thing happened the day tester visited in  partner david c strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a bonus that exactly equaled his  contribution to testers campaign the maximum allowed a few days later partner garrett bradley  until recently the house assistant majority leader on beacon hill  got a bonus too exactly matching his  gift to tester 
thats quite a coincidence 
from  through  strouss and bradley along with founding partner michael thornton and his wife donated nearly  million to democratic party fundraising committees and a parade of politicians  from senate minority leader harry reid of nevada to hawaii gubernatorial candidate david ige to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts over the same span the lawyers received  million listed as bonuses in thornton law firm records more than  of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within  days

thats quite an endorsement  and if theres anything top fbi officials now its crime families certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that hillary can claim in any field 
the clintons thats a crime family basically former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said its like organized crime i mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool 
kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liar 
he also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private server 
the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that 
kallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureau 
the agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said 
but according to the media the fbi investigating hillary is the real crime",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hillary_clinton_1_2.jpg?itok=4ISnsqTA,hate,obamas doj also obstructed clinton foundation investigation,freedom center urges college presidents end aid campus supporters terror ask withdraw university privileges granted sjp october frontpagemagcom editors note following letter sent presidents ten campuses named freedom centers report top ten schools supporting terrorists alphabetical order ten campuses brooklyn college cuny san diego state university san francisco state university tufts university university california berkeley university california irvine university california los angeles university chicago university tennessee knoxville vassar college october university california dear dr napolitano school purports promote values diversity inclusiveness tolerance yet provides resources funding legitimacy students justice palestine students justice palestine campus organization whose sole purpose conduct hateful propaganda jews jewish state terrorist organization hamas explicit goals hamas destruction worlds jewish state genocide jewish population reasons among others three campuses university californiairvine los angeles berkeleyhave named among top ten schools supporting terrorists david horowitz freedom center may read full report httpwwwstopthejewhatredoncampusorgnewstoptenschoolssupportingterroristsfallreport masquerades typical campus cultural group sjp integral part hamass efforts annihilate israel boycott divestment sanctions bds campaign insidious effort attempts delegitimize israel smear rogue apartheid nation claims ludicrous million palestinians enjoy israeli citizenship including rights vote sit israeli courts parliament harvard professor alan dershowitz said bds movement antisemitic antizionist antihuman rights antiintellectual antiscience antinegotiation antipeace anticompromise antipalestinian workers denied opportunities work larry summers hillary clinton denounced bds antisemitic jew hatred yet school provides platform funding sponsors university support sjp also conducts israeli apartheid hate weeks campus quads events feature prohamas advocates construction apartheid walls featuring prohamas antisemitic propaganda creation mock checkpoints dieins disrupt student movements campus sjp actively disrupts proisrael campus eventsa threat free speech violation universitys stated values rules conduct addition scripted hamas terrorists sjps proterror campaign funded guided hamas front called american muslims palestine recent testimony house foreign affairs committee jonathan schanzer worked terrorism finance analyst united states department treasury described hamas funnels large sums money provides material assistance students justice palestine sjp hamas front group american muslims palestine amp purpose promoting bds campaigns american campuses amp created sjp cofounder hatem bazian proterrorist lecturer uc berkeley called suicide bombing intifada inside united states employs highranking officials muslim charities previously shut providing material assistance terrorists schanzer described amp arguably important sponsor organizer students justice palestine sjp visible arm bds campaign campuses united states detailed amp provides speakers training printed materials socalled apartheid wall grants sjp activists even campus coordinator staff whose job work directly sjp probds campus groups across country furthermore according email sent subscribers amp spent campus activities alone students justice palestine continues accept funding aid hamas front group american muslims palestine despite links terrorist organizations agendas students justice palestine continues receive campus funds campus privileges including university offices right hold events preaching genocidal values hamas university property privileges would normally denied groups preach hatred ethnic group let alone one supports barbaric terrorists slaughter men women children goal cleansing earth people disagree light facts ask withdraw university privileges granted sjp campus groups promote genocidal hamas agenda put end terrorist influences infiltrated campus threaten security jewish students campus americans david horowitz ceo david horowitz freedom center sherman oaks california,1,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T05:57:53.998+02:00,hillary campaign launching attacks on the fbi,"americans seek to help persecuted christians  government helps muslims the people of the united states get it but the obama administration could care less october   
originally published by the gatestone institute raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
as the muslim persecution of christians continues to reach critical proportions around the world see report below the average american shows much more concern than the current administration soon after it was revealed that the obama administration has taken in  muslim refugees but only  christianseven though christians are approximately  percent of syrias population and are classified as experiencing a genocide therea poll found that more than three quarters of american respondents agreed with the statement it is important to me that the next us president be committed to addressing the persecution that some christians face around the world eg imprisonment beheadings rape loss of home and assets 
the deliberate targeting and killing of christians in europe also reached unprecedented levels in modern times most notably on the morning of july   allahu akbar  shouting muslims stormed a small church in france during morning mass they forced yearold fr jacques hamel to his knees slit his throat and  critically injured  a nun before being killed by police it was later revealed that police had known that church was being targeted and had even been monitoring one of the murderers for at least oneandahalf years 
later when a journalist asked pope francis if fr jacques was  killed in the name of islam  the pope disagreed he argued that he hears of christians committing violence every day in italy this one who has murdered his girlfriend another who has murdered the motherinlaw and these are baptized catholics there are violent catholics if i speak of islamic violence i must speak of catholic violence the logic of the popes statement seems to be that violence done in direct contradiction of the judeochristian gods commandmentssuch as the murder of wives and mothersinlawis identical to violence done in accordance with allahs commandments to wage jihad on infidels 
in isiscontrolled territories in iraq and syria reports of christians being tortured to convert maimed crucified burned alive beheaded or sold into sex slavery continued to emerge in iraq a report says that christians and other minorities in iraq are facing persecution at unprecedented levels and are at the verge of extinction  the christian population has dwindled from  million to  in the last decade according to some estimates however minority rights group put that the number at anywhere between  to  
a former isis member exposed some of the atrocities the group commits in syria they were extremely brutal killing women and the elderly who did not obey them they abused and mutilated their dead bodies they cut up the corpses tied them to the back of the cars and dragged them along they would find them and publicly execute them i witnessed many executions

islamic state  isis has been making use of social mediaincluding facebook and mobile apps like whatapp and telegram to sell enslaved christian and yazidi girls to a wider network of sadists and pedophiles one telegram posting showed a picture of a young girl with the caption virgin beautiful  years old the posting states her price has reached  and she will be sold soon 
nigeria another report says that the muslim terrorist group boko haram has murdered  people almost all of whom were christian for refusing to convert to islam they also forced  women and young girls to marry their fighters

suffered physical abuse at the hands of prison guards when he was forced to attend an appeal hearing dhimmitude muslim contempt and hostility for christians 
bangladesh  christian and hindu businesses received notices from a banned islamic organization ordering them to uphold a number of islamic customs or be killed these include hanging banners with allahs name keeping copies of the koran putting pictures of the kaba in mecca removing pictures or statues of their own religions creating a place for muslims to pray and banning music and female workers

egypt  after a christian man was stabbed to death and many christian homes and a church burned by angry muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built coptic christian bishop makarious of alminya was interviewed on television church authorities in egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say but makarious made many revealing comments although only christians no muslims were killed and hurt he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other within minutes of the start of one of the attacks  muslims instantly appeared fully armed as if ready for war he added as long as the attackers are never punished and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty this will just encourage others to continue the attacks since even if they are arrested they will be quickly released when the host asked questions about who is released and why suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the christians the bishop replied well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested with complete proofs and evidences against them but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time about this series 
the persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes 
 to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians 
 to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia 
accordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof 
because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it

dear dr napolitano 
your school purports to promote the values of diversity inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources funding and legitimacy to students for justice in palestine students for justice in palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against jews and the jewish state for the terrorist organization hamas the explicit goals of hamas are the destruction of the worlds only jewish state and genocide against its jewish population for these reasons among others three campuses of the university of californiairvine los angeles and berkeleyhave been named among the top ten schools supporting terrorists by the david horowitz freedom center you may read the full report here httpwwwstopthejewhatredoncampusorgnewstoptenschoolssupportingterroristsfallreport 
while it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group sjp is an integral part of hamass efforts to annihilate israel through the boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign this is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize israel and smear it as a rogue apartheid nation these claims are ludicrous more than a million palestinians enjoy israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the israeli courts and parliament harvard professor alan dershowitz has said of the bds movement it is antisemitic antizionist antihuman rights antiintellectual antiscience antinegotiation antipeace anticompromise and antipalestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work both larry summers and hillary clinton have denounced bds as antisemitic jew hatred yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors 
with university support sjp also conducts israeli apartheid hate weeks on campus quads these events feature prohamas advocates the construction of apartheid walls featuring prohamas antisemitic propaganda and the creation of mock checkpoints and dieins that disrupt student movements on campus sjp actively disrupts proisrael campus eventsa threat to free speech and a violation of your universitys stated values and rules of conduct 
in addition to being scripted by hamas terrorists sjps proterror campaign is funded and guided through a hamas front called american muslims for palestine in recent testimony before the house foreign affairs committee jonathan schanzer who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the united states department of the treasury from  described how hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to students for justice in palestine sjp through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine amp for the purpose of promoting bds campaigns on american campuses amp was created by sjp cofounder hatem bazian a proterrorist lecturer at uc berkeley who called for a suicide bombing intifada inside the united states it employs highranking officials from other muslim charities that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists 
schanzer described amp as arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for students for justice in palestine sjp which is the most visible arm of the bds campaign on campuses in the united states he detailed how amp provides speakers training printed materials a socalled apartheid wall and grants to sjp activists and even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with sjp and other probds campus groups across the country furthermore according to an email it sent to subscribers amp spent  on campus activities in  alone 
students for justice in palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas students for justice in palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges including university offices and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of hamas on university property these privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them 
in light of these facts we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to sjp and other campus groups who promote the genocidal hamas agenda and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of jewish students on your campus but of all americans

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
september   has come and gone countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the countrys tallest skyscrapers once stood some have burned to ash others had their throats slashed by islamic terrorists still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another islamic terror attack from taking place 
but joe has an idea joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy 
the senator from delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in wilmington his formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights his teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly after a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the senate seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with and therefore a man to be listened to 
even if you wish he would shut up 
im groping here joe says for once he isnt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs massaging squeezing caressing instead hes talking about foreign policy the chair of the senate foreign relations committee has no clue 
joe is worried that the muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us and he has a plan to make them feel better 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran senator joe biden says 
the remark isnt quite as random as it seems the senator from delaware a state not known for its large muslim or iranian population has a friendly relationship with the iran lobby that relationship will only grow friendlier during the bush era as he attacks america and appeases its enemies 
iranianamericans who hate the jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a proiranian lobbyists home in california while treasonously attacking his own government for naming iran one of the members of the axis of evil 
joes usual amtrak obsession wouldnt get him in the door in california but treason hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside delaware and joe remains very fond of iran 
he informs israeli officials that israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran and thats all the way back in  before the deal that puts iran on the path to a shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in obamas eye and a radioactive itch in hillarys socks 
that was a big year for biden it was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the white house joe had tried it in  and was stomped by dukakis of all people after being caught plagiarizing a speech by british politician neil kinnock  got him a useless position in the white house as a consolation prize 
this time around joe biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from hillary clinton that she got from barack obama the office of secretary of state of the united states 
of all the jobs that joe biden wants and is utterly unfit for amtrak train engineer secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar its hard to think of one that hes less fit for 
joe biden blamed darfur on the gingrich revolution he fell in love with the taliban 
the taliban per se is not our enemy joe insisted there is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the taliban is our enemy 
he suggested that  of the taliban were probably okay and only  were incorrigible most of the taliban he seemed to think were like joe biden just in it for the money 
but joe biden has a soft spot for islamic terrorists whether theyre the shiite jihadists of iran or the sunni jihadists of the taliban joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back 
it wasnt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on bushs ruination of relations with the rest of the world if biden were to become secretary of state he would become the third democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician the last time a professional held down the job would have been the bush administration 
and yet perversely each loser secretary has been more incompetent than the last hillarys disastrous time as secretary of state could only be exceeded by john kerry who gave away everything to the russians and who was contradicted by the white house so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man or just any man the only loser who could follow two class acts like that was joe biden 
joe bidens amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another even his visit to israel a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by american politicians became an international incident with biden sulking in his room while hillary yelled at prime minister netanyahu for  minutes over the phone but somehow biden with his gift for appeasing iran and the taliban alienates allies 
just this year joe biden launched yet another attack on israel a cynic might almost think that tehran joe loves islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them 
biden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat he accused president bush of being shortsighted for using the military to fight islamic terrorists he argued that the perception that we want to stay in iraq helps al qaeda some years later his administrations decision to pull out led to the rise of isis he called for closing gitmo while insisting that it had become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world 
senator joe biden was a voice for appeasement vice president joe biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of islamic terror secretary of state joe biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies he could even write that check to iran though the obamabiden era has seen cash transfers to iran that make joes  million check seem like chump change

No Author,2016-10-31T10:53:40.058+02:00,americans seek to help persecuted christians government helps muslims  frontpage magazine,"hillary clinton and the presidents  longer game  at home and abroad a nation less affluent less free and far less secure october   lloyd billingsley 
the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world used a pseudonym to communicate with secretary of state hillary clinton on her private unsecured email server as andrew mccarthy contended  that was the reason the fbi declined to prosecute clinton because the president would have been part of the same action and that wouldnt be politically correct 
the current president of the united states is also on record that contrary to custom he will linger in washington dc for a few years wherever he chooses to live the email intrigue suggests continuing backchannel communications with hillary clinton should she become president that invites a look at what the man the new york times dubbed obamas narrator the white house adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word had to say about the presidents vision of the future 
few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment david axelrod explained in his massive  believer  but at home and abroad obama was playing a longer game as he explained in columbia missouri on october   we are five days away from fundamentally transforming the united states of america 
if this man was a liberal as barry rubin wondered in silent revolution how the left rose to political power and cultural dominance  why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as franklin roosevelt with his new deal and lyndon johnson with his great society he saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical 
as david horowitz explained in volume  of the black book of the american left  the president was born bred and trained in the progressive movement his mentors were communists and their progressive successors so no wonder he presided over the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government for eight years what that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident 
the economy remains sluggish and under obamacare the presidents signature plan premiums are skyrocketing  this suggests that as many believe obamacare was simply a demolition plan in the longer game designated successor hillary clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare what some candidates erroneously call socialized medicine 
as rubin noted the goal of the left is to convince americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer the result may be a very longterm and even permanent change of the united states into something else a nation far less affluent and far less free and far less secure as david axelrod also indicates 
vladimir putin makes an appearance in believer but obamas narrator does not outline putins background in the kgb the believer includes nothing about putins role in east germany a stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape the narrator avoids putins belief that the breakup of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century 
in believer  putin tells the president you are a highly educated man i come from the security sector the believer then asks the president for his assessment of putin 
hes smart tough clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality the president says that is not very strong language for a kgb veteran and expansionist autocrat 
in his narrators account the president uses the word

Frontpagemag.com,2016-10-31T11:11:00.000+02:00,freedom center urges college presidents to end aid to campus supporters of terror,"search selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list leftists and atheists appalled that splcs hit list of islam critics includesleftists and atheists october   robert spencer 
sam harris thinks its unbelievable that maajid nawaz and ayaan hirsi ali made it to the southern poverty law centers hit list of antimuslim extremists he said nothing about me or the other people whom the splc included which is not surprising since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the splc list exemplifies 
hemant mehta of the friendly atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over nawaz and hirsi ali being included if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too and make no mistake thats what nawaz and hirsi ali are doing thats all theyre doing theyre not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
the problem with being angry about nawaz and hirsi ali being on the splc list but silent about everyone else who is on it is that what mehta says about nawaz and hirsi ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about islam will be on the list  and that is indeed the objective of the list to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics mehta protests that nawaz and hirsi ali are not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
but no one would think that the other  were antimuslim if it hadnt been for the southern poverty law center and the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression with hating a group of people  a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression mehta and co are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends 
and as for working with moderate muslims for  years jihad watch has contained this invitation  any muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our antijihadist efforts it is nawaz as well as other moderates who has attacked me in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among muslims i never attacked him and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise 
in complaining that nawaz and hirsi ali are merely criticizing religious beliefs and are not antimuslim mehta is strongly implying that the others on the splc list are doing something beyond criticizing religious beliefs and are indeed antimuslim on twitter the last couple of days ive seen many people express outrage that nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of spencer but when i ask them what the big difference is between us or for quotes from me that are actually bigoted they go silent 
mehta harris haider and the others who are only angry with the splcs hit list because it included nawaz and hirsi ali are by their selective outrage acquiescing to and legitimizing the splcs demonization of the other people on the list in his own defense hemant mehta wrote me to explain somewhat unsatisfactorily i focused on those two because theyre well known in atheist circles this is a selfdefeating choice for them to have made for the splc has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of islam and never will the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about islam that is not warmly positive 
the turn of mehta harris and haider will come for the same treatment one wonders if when this happens there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as antimuslim with their tacit approval",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sdf.jpg?itok=a_1pk7_P,hate,hillary clinton presidents longer game,hillary panicking fbi weiner emails past days seen major shift clinton tactics original investigation clinton campaign political media allies launched attacks republicans wasting time investigating hillary attack fbi misrepresented fbi statements certainly target investigators way seeing open hostilities lynch doj fbi clinton campaign circulating letter attacking fbi countless media hit pieces aimed fbi obvious question clinton campaign kept cool least degree certainly didnt begin illadvised campaign fbi thats kind tactic may play core base alienates everyone else say everyone isnt media whats going clintons thought done close election theyre lashing typically paranoid nasty behavior clintons hillary tried playing humble tried apologizing moment ago victory seemed inevitable shes state fury put risk something emails genuinely frightens clinton campaign took crazy risk going fbi barrels desperate smear fbi much possible order neutralize revelations even potential charges attacks warning treat hillary kid gloves else first plausible degree hillarys awkwardness didnt lose past losing theres evidence beyond speculation latter yet major shift tactics rather striking clinton campaign panicking would look like,1,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T11:09:00.000+02:00,meet hillary clintons secretary of state,"a resolution on jerusalem that will fuel antijewish incitement and violence october   joseph puder 
if anyone doubted the fact that the united nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiisrael and antijewish animus the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco vote on jerusalem proved it the unesco world heritage committee voted this week october   on a resolution dealing with jerusalem drafted by the palestinian and jordanian delegations and submitted by kuwait lebanon and tunisia all arab muslim states the executive committee of unesco approved  for  opposed  abstained and  missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which  memberstates approved the resolution algeria bangladesh brazil cuba chad dominican republic egypt iran lebanon malaysia morocco mauritius mexico mozambique nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan qatar russia senegal south africa sudan and vietnam  opposed estonia germany lithuania the netherlands uk and the us among the abstaining  states were argentina france greece india japan kenya south korea spain sri lanka and sweden 
the resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths 
according to hillel neuer executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights neuer added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines 
the expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of solomon stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths 
the latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david 
among the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths 
preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history 
unescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco 
earlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site 
unesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference 
whereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday 
dore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem 
most dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/dr_1.jpg?itok=23-8EVDd,hate,selective outrage splcs antimuslim extremist list,reminders ignore trump doomed polls weve recently two object lessons worthlessness trump doomed polling saga days ago media loudly trumpeting hillarys victory inevitable polls going ignore trump focus building administration winning downticket races like last time around numbers turned around recently asked predict race answered one thing could predict media claim landslide hillary right election much likely medias interest spread fud promoting polls predict hillary win landslide creating perception voting useless republicans feel outcome futile less likely go vote scandal polling numbers history rebounding remains challenging unusual election premature panic weve seen circles unhealthy shouldnt completely ignore poll numbers neither treat inevitable weve two major lessons thats short sighted,1,Real
Lloyd Billingsley,2016-10-31T11:09:00.000+02:00,hillary clinton and the presidents longer game,"is hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails   
these past few days have seen a major shift in the clinton tactics during the original investigation the clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at republicans for wasting time investigating hillary but did not attack the fbi it misrepresented fbi statements but it certainly did not target investigators in the way were seeing now 
but now we have open hostilities between lynch at the doj and the fbi we have the clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the fbi we have countless media hit pieces aimed at the fbi 
the obvious question is why the clinton campaign kept its cool at least to some degree before it certainly didnt begin an illadvised campaign against the fbi thats the kind of tactic that may play to your core base but alienates everyone else that is to say everyone who isnt in the media 
so whats going on here 
 the clintons thought they were done its close to the election so theyre lashing out its typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the clintons hillary tried playing humble she tried apologizing but a moment ago her victory seemed inevitable and now shes in a state of fury at having it put at risk 
 there is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the clinton campaign which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the fbi with both barrels its desperate to smear the fbi as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges the attacks are a warning to treat hillary with kid gloves again or else

Robert Spencer,2016-10-31T11:08:00.000+02:00,selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list," reminders to ignore the trump is doomed polls   
weve recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the trump is doomed polling saga a few days ago the media was loudly trumpeting that hillarys victory was inevitable that the polls were in and she was going to ignore trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races and then just like last time around the numbers turned around again 
i was recently asked to predict the race i answered that the one thing i could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for hillary right before the election that much is very likely 
its in the medias interest to spread fud by promoting polls that predict not just a hillary win but a landslide creating the perception that voting is useless the more republicans feel that the outcome is futile the less likely they will be to go out and vote but the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding this remains a challenging and very unusual election 
the premature panic weve seen in some circles is unhealthy we shouldnt completely ignore poll numbers but neither should we treat them as inevitable 
weve had two major lessons in why thats short sighted",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nbv.jpg?itok=c1RwRhG5,hate,hillary panicking fbi weiner emails,dnc head leaked nd debate question hillary october talking debbie wasserman schultz exmuppet charge dnc forced resign way dnc rigged process favor hillary donna brazile brought replace bring back integrity dnc since brazile another clinton loyalist never going happen latest leak reveals brazile passed along second debate question hillary emphasizes fraudulent rigged whole debate process another leaked email emerged showing democratic national committee boss former cnn contributor donna brazile sharing debate question advance hillary clinton campaign despite braziles persistent claims contrary cnn announced statement soon email became public monday brazile tendered resignation network accepted oct days controversy brazile tipping clinton campaign initially broke according documents released monday wikileaks brazile sent clinton communications director jennifer palmieri email titled one questions directed hrc tomorrow woman rash night march cnn primary debate flint mich family lead poison ask anything hillary president help ppl flint brazile wrote following night leeanne walters mom whose twin boys stopped growing whose daughter lost hair flint water contamination crisis posed question clinton eventual democratic presidential nominee primary opponent vermont sen bernie sanders clinton responded lengthy answer moderator anderson cooper twice interrupt attempt keep agreedupon time limit pervasive kind thing process getting snapshot clintons people rigged process faked results favor every turn,1,Real

remember last week when hillary clinton was shopping around for white house drapes and the popular wisdom was that she was inevitable that was fun wasnt it now she hit an unfavorability rating high of  percent thats higher than trump 
it also means that the candidate who claims shes going to bring americans together is disliked by most of the country  
clinton is seen unfavorably by  percent of likely voters in the latest results a new high trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many   percent marking the depth of these views  percent see clinton strongly unfavorably and  percent say the same about trump  unusual levels of strong sentiment

were not talking about debbie wasserman schultz the exmuppet in charge of the dnc who was forced to resign because of the way the dnc rigged the process to favor hillary this is donna brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the dnc since brazile is another clinton loyalist that was never going to happen 
but the latest leak reveals that brazile had passed along a second debate question to hillary all this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was 
another leaked email has emerged showing democratic national committee boss and former cnn contributor donna brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the hillary clinton campaign  despite braziles persistent claims to the contrary 
cnn announced in a statement soon after the email became public monday that brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on oct  days after the controversy over brazile tipping off the clinton campaign initially broke 
according to documents released monday by wikileaks brazile sent clinton communications director jennifer palmieri an email titled one of the questions directed to hrc tomorrow is from a woman with a rash the night before the march  cnn primary debate in flint mich 
her family has lead poison and she will ask what if anything will hillary do as president to help the ppl of flint brazile wrote 
the following night leeanne walters a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the flint water contamination crisis posed a question to both clinton the eventual democratic presidential nominee and her primary opponent vermont sen bernie sanders

independents are the largest political group in the country larger than either democrats or republicans and theyre tilting toward trump and the gop

independents  sometimes swing voters in past elections albeit inconsistently  also merit attention theyve gone from a scant  points in clintons favor in the first four nights of tracking  percent to a substantial trump lead now  percent clintontrump 
a key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote they were  points more likely to lean toward the republican party rather than the democratic party at the start of tracking but are  points more apt to do so now 
hillary clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with republicans and can get things done while portraying trump as dangerous and irresponsible it certainly worked to a degree

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T19:30:19.719+02:00,dnc head leaked nd debate question to hillary,"the renewed criminal investigation into hillarys misdeeds  and how it could affect the election november   matthew vadum 
democrats are in panic mode a week out from election day as they try to spin away the fbis newly announced discovery of a hoard of twothirds of a million potentially sensitive emails apparently related to hillary clintons catastrophic tenure as americas top diplomat 
partisan hack james carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories 
i think it is an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for fbi director james comey thats what i think 
he added this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election it ought to be called for what it is 
just this past july comey was praised by democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue clinton there is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of clinton and the endlessly corrupt bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation which functions as a bribe processing center for wouldbe president hillary clinton 
but democrats have suddenly flipped sides denouncing comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails 
carville long known as the ragin cajun is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election 
the old clinton hand may be right 
investigators found  emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former rep anthony weiner d and his wife longtime senior hillary aide huma abedin the computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl 
underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter reports the wall street journal  some of the information emailed may have been classified 
abedin who has intergenerational ties to the muslim brotherhood reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop 
over the objections of attorney general loretta lynch comey notified congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among fbi employees the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power 
lynch is doing her best to make sure the department of justice probe goes nowhere 
assistant attorney general for legislative affairs peter j kadzik whom zero hedge calls the best friend of john podesta hillarys campaign chairman and former white house chief of staff in bill clintons administration is heading up the email probe 
so the fix is in 
in any event the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted comey to act 
people are upset at comey because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the clinton team and the obama white house in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing 
it was back on july  comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent he said even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent the next day attorney general lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against hillary lynch as everyone now knows had a clandestine meeting with former president bill clinton at a phoenix airport a week before at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made 
this internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that comey felt he had to act immediately 
i have some sources in the fbi and the former district attorneys commentator larry kudlow said sunday on nbcs meet the press the fbi is in full revolt right now the fbi has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer 
ever the hillary shill host chuck todd corrected kudlow 
not full revolt he said theres been a lot i mean itsthere are agentslets not say full revolt 
all right a semifull revolt said kudlow 
because what im getting at is if comey hadnt said what he said to congress and the rest of the world it would have leaked it would have leaked that whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with anthony weiner and huma abedin so i dont think comey had much chance here and i think the fbi is badly divided 
meanwhile the trickle of bad news for hillary clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days 
clinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the donald trump campaign top democrat operatives robert creamer and scott foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents the euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators the homeless and the mentally ill to cause melees at trump rallies 
fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteilung or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers 
longtime democrat pollster and campaign consultant doug schoen a familiar face on fox news channel announced he could no longer in good conscience support clintons candidacy 
im deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected he said sunday if the secretary of state wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with top aide huma abedin under criminal investigation 
republican donald trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters 
clintons unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds trumps shes at  percent hes at  percent 
former new york mayor and leading trump surrogate rudy giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from wikileaks and the fbi to indict clinton for racketeering bill clinton does the speeches they put the money in the pocket she does the favors in the government said giuliani a former federal prosecutor it all links up why did they destroy  emails because it shows the link 
influential liberal journalist ron fournier threw hillary under the bus mrs clinton got a secret server to protect what the washington post called the circle of enrichment he said

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-31T19:56:35.868+02:00,independents tilt decisively to trump,"how the nevertrumpers sunk themselves november   
bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
the chorus of nevertrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and hillarys supposed victory approach after more than a year of complaining about trump crashing their political soiree the republicans attacking trump still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the republican masses 
a recent example comes from premier nevertrumper bret stephens of the wall street journal  in his column stephens bids farewell to a republican party stupid enough to nominate trump contrasting it with his imagined golden age of republican policy excellence that trump and his followers have destroyed one policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make trump the nominee 
at a  republican primary debate in houston candidates george hw bush and ronald reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free mr bush said they should were creating a whole society of really honorable decent familyloving people that are in violation of the law he lamented 
reagan agreed instead of putting up a fence he asked why dont we    make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while theyre working and earning here they pay taxes here for good measure reagan suggested we should open the border both ways 
where in the populist fervor to build a wall with mexico and deport millions of human beings is that republican party today 
take bush seniors statement first it repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan gang of eight recycled in  during their push for comprehensive immigration reform another euphemism for amnesty all those hardworking familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows as john mccain said and start voting republican the political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love 
this stance on illegal immigration by republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people take mccains oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows seriously illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities and living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported theyll soon be back remember juan francisco lopezsanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered kate steinle or angel gilberto garciaavalos another fivetime deportee who just this month started a  million fire in sequoia national park he had just been released from the kern county jail but could not be deported because of californias lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents 
simply repeating the hardworking family values religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration there are such illegal immigrants as i know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the san joaquin valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country i grew up with mexicanamericans theyre members of my immediate family theyre my friends students and colleagues theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border 
some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not a rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff but bush mccain and stephens have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go that means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows but all those guilty of duis hitandruns or defrauding the welfare system with fake ids will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous  immigration act which enshrined family reunification with no limits on relatives of us citizens 
equally tonedeaf is stephenss bringing up ronald reagans open the border both ways thats exactly what he did in  when he signed the simpsonmazzoli act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of border enforcement that never materialized stephens doesnt mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about  million to  million creating todays crisis the obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the  million it would be governmental malfeasance to repeat reagans mistake 
the problem with politicians and pundits like stephens is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores people like stephens dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of broken windows such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars hitandruns driving without insurance gangbanging and dealing drugs 
and if mr stephens thinks im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist i dare him to visit the san joaquin valley better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month come and tour a hospital emergency room a social security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these honorable decent familyloving people it would take just a week for mr stephens to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun then again he wouldnt last that long within a day hed scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening 
and that hypocrisy is where trump came from in the perception of millions of votersperceptions nevertrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters and so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become obama  and continue the progressive destruction of the constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party what sort of principle is

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-01T06:27:23.010+02:00,hillary clinton campaign still whining about the fbi,"obama wont vote with america at the un under obama the united states wont defend the united states november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
a generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
on a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un 
un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain samantha power said 
thank you she added acknowledging the applause 
under obama the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc 
instead of defending america obamas chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said 
if the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador power if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc 
the cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable 
ben rhodes the close obama adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
who is this we 
the cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors 
this we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one 
one member of the we must be ben rhodes because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed obama to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america 
no one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states 
we is obama who made the final decision its ambassador samantha power its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un 
america has a we problem 
if the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country 
when president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work 
these days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists 
thats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works 
the first word in the introduction to obamas presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i obamas basis for his authority is his  announcement letat cest moi obama is the state 
jfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of  
the i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master 
in obamas directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack obama there is no law only obama 
now the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but ben rhodes who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip obama has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but ben rhodes isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in america one is us the other is we 
we does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours 
we happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back 
you can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america 
president kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy  we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice 
kennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc 
it is easy to sit here in the distant future of  and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left 
by backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked 
but the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired  
what we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in  summed up as a boot stamping on a human face  forever 
president kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador power cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba 
the cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their communist overlords the question is will the united states of america be able to regain its independence from the we",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hillary-clinton-email-leak-scandal-fbi-reopens-investigation-latest-updates-4_1.jpg?itok=NB98nciK,hate,trump happened,force fanaticism wahhabism saudi arabia beyond wahhabism complete distortion islam november raymond ibrahim note follows shillman fellow raymond ibrahim reviews force fanaticism wahhabism saudi arabia beyond simon ross valentine shorter version book review first appeared middle east quarterly fall vol valentine british methodist pastor teacher taught saudi arabia written useful book desert kingdom interesting exploration monarchy single greatest force spreading islamic fundamentalism spent much billion spread wahhabism west yet america britain continuing implicit supporters wahhabism valentine discusses background unholy alliance came warns west simply ignores saudi arabias role international terrorism seems likely worsen rather conveniently disappear troubling considering isis saudi arabias latest monstrous contribution world history author explores important topics including mutawwa religious police provides useful historical context discussing origins wahhabism alliance house saud oil discoveries changed everything books primary defect standard valentine regularly insists greatest importance distinguish wahhabism islam generally anything good positive tolerant peaceful ascribed islam anything bad negative intolerant violentmisogyny draconian punishments execution apostates intolerance discrimination nonmuslimsis ascribed wahhabism position appears based authors cultural presuppositions thus felt confused puzzled hear wahhabi intolerance including attempt propagate beliefs force prompting wonder force someone love god conversations ulema imams mutawa religious police saudis generally never mention love idea god loved frightful talk hell burning future pain believe accept wahhabi faith valentine engaged critical reading islamic doctrine historyas opposed projecting christian notion god onto islamhe wouldve known muhammad followed countless caliphs sultans throughout centuries propagate beliefs force overwhelming majority todays muslim world taken nonmuslims force although islam attributes characteristics god love one valentines readers wouldve benefit much simply laid useful information concerning inner workings saudi regime unholy alliance west without trying tackle deeper question islam really isleading yet another book marred islamic apologetics,1,Real
Matthew Vadum,2016-11-01T07:32:54.394+02:00,democratic panic,"dawn perlmutter 
the war on law enforcement is epidemic every aspect of culture has been infected the antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media in memes in movements in popular fast food restaurants at football games on campuses in media and in every aspect of american culture 
an epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time colin kaepernick is the typhoid mary of the antipolice epidemic kaepernick refuses to stand while the us national anthem is being performed at the start of nfl games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality on sept  kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench his explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current us military members as if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting he misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission similar to hands up dont shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning the media reverently refers to kaepernicks protest as taking a knee as if it is some kind of sacred act there are no headlines that read kaepernick disses the flag or kaepernick takes a crap on his country just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies he has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant black panther party to socks that depict police as pigs in addition to numerous other crimes the black panther party was responsible for the murder of at least  officers and originated the expression off the pigs meaning murder police 
like the typhoid infected cook mary mallon kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen in what has been dubbed the kaepernick effect dozens of nfl and wnba players have knelt sat or raised a fist during the national anthem the disease has also spread to over  high schools  colleges and one middle school in what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the star spangled banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing one of the women denasia lawrence not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a black lives matter tshirt exposing miami heat fans to the contagious disorder 
rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases the antipolice disorder also contaminated the navy an unidentified sailor assigned to the naval air technical training center in pensacola florida filmed herself deliberately not standing for the national anthem and posted it on facebook she remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised colin kaepernick another sailor petty officer nd class janaye ervin an intelligence specialist in the navy reserve stationed at pearl harbor did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform she also posted a statement on facebook saying she was inspired by colin kaepernick the navy acted decisively she lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions it is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it 
kaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order 
early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified 
the antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants employees have refused to serve officers at a taco bell in phenix city al dunkin donuts in west hartford ct krispy kreme in columbia sc ihop in virginia beach va arbys in pembroke pines fl chuck e cheese in bowling green ky whataburger in lewisville tx mcdonalds in brenham tx chipotle in brooklyn ny genghis grill in dallas tx noodles  company in alexandria va tropical smoothie in winter haven fl luckys teriyaki sedrowoolley wa and at the krystal restaurant in irondale al other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a philadelphia starbucks refusing service at a sunoco gas station in miramar fl writing black lives matter on an officers coffee cup at a dunkin donuts in providence ri and a walmart bakery in mcdonough ga refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party these are just the incidents that have been made public 
refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic 
the antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and kaepernick 
as the disease progresses more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence a particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in philadelphia chicago albuquerque fresno denver new orleans oakland austin honolulu rochester san diego st paul covington richmond goshen fayetteville raleigh and many other cities across the country vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint toppling and scratching granite burning to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame in a previous article  i described these acts as symbolic assassinations vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of this is another symptom of the antipolice disease a sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers 
at its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/tr3.jpg?itok=OFI7QhAc,hate,obama wont vote america un,government truly alleviate poverty leftist policies made worse november thomas sowell political left keeps announcing new breakthrough discovery life unfair never read thomas grays elegy written country churchyard two half centuries ago economic historian david landes statement world never level playing field joint autobiography milton friedman wife rose say everywhere world gross inequities income wealth offend us fail moved contrast luxury enjoyed grinding poverty suffered others moreover professor friedman left behind foundation dedicated promoting school choice disadvantaged children could get better education better chance life political left saying think new breakthrough necessity progress important test evidence ever subjected notions one presented social vision left often nicholas kristof new york times one certain happen share vision dont get repeatedly declared mr kristofs essay growing poor america october th new york times classic example mindset left begins story poor black teenager arkansas raised single mom sometimes goes hungry home even one book television sets huge screens apparently money enough buy marijuana surely agree young fellow unpromising future prospects ahead human tragedy circumstances life unfair none us would want born circumstances moreover one many brought setting full dangers low probability improvement enough mr kristof political left general youngsters says society fail long fail us whoa society make decisions engage actions led teenager bad situation society acquire either omniscience omnipotence prevent left says society usually mean government apparently society means case kristof laments teenager kind person americas presidential candidates dont talk left chooses believe government intervention answer tragedies right expect rest us share belief surely could subject belief empirical test however triumphant decade wanted government intervention solve called social problems work things like social vision triumphed things like afterwards homicide victimization rates among black males going substantially homicide victimization rates reversed skyrocketed wiping progress two previous decades began black children born families mother father great welfare state expansion black children born single mother like youngster arkansas today kristofs essay also mentions teenage girl single mother suggests sex education could prevented getting pregnant teenage pregnancy going repeat reversed shot began bringing sex education vision schools across country similar trends occurred england similar visions policies also triumphed perhaps left doesnt get cannot face hard fact vision policies worsened things claimed would made better,1,Real

note in what follows shillman fellow raymond ibrahim reviews force and fanaticism wahhabism in saudi arabia and beyond by simon ross valentine a shorter version of the book review first appeared in the middle east quarterly fall  vol  no  
valentine a british methodist pastor and teacher who taught in saudi arabia has written a useful book about the desert kingdom most interesting is its exploration of how the monarchy is the single greatest force in spreading islamic fundamentalism it has spent as much as  billion to spread wahhabism in the west yet america and britain have been and are continuing to be implicit supporters of wahhabism 
valentine discusses the background of how this unholy alliance came about he warns if the west simply ignores it saudi arabias role in international terrorism seems likely to worsen rather than conveniently disappear this is troubling considering that isis is saudi arabias latest monstrous contribution to world history 
the author explores important topics including the mutawwa  or religious police and provides useful historical context discussing the origins of wahhabism its alliance with the house of saud and the oil discoveries that changed everything 
the books primary defect is standard valentine regularly insists that it is of the greatest importance to distinguish between wahhabism and islam generally anything good positive tolerant and peaceful is ascribed to islam anything bad negative intolerant and violentmisogyny draconian punishments execution of apostates intolerance for and discrimination against nonmuslimsis ascribed to wahhabism 
this position appears to be based on the authors own cultural presuppositions thus he felt confused and puzzled to hear of wahhabi intolerance including the attempt to propagate their beliefs by force prompting him to wonder can you force someone to love god in all the conversations i had with ulema imams mutawa religious police and saudis generally there was never a mention of love the idea that god loved me just frightful talk of hell burning and future pain if i did not believe and accept the wahhabi faith 
had valentine engaged in a critical reading of islamic doctrine and historyas opposed to projecting his christian notion of god onto islamhe wouldve known that muhammad followed by countless caliphs and sultans throughout the centuries did propagate their beliefs by force the overwhelming majority of todays muslim world was taken from nonmuslims by force and that although islam attributes  characteristics to god love is not one of them

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-01T07:32:54.859+02:00,obama wont vote with america at the un,"if government can truly alleviate poverty why have leftist policies only made it worse november   thomas sowell 
the political left keeps announcing as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs that life is unfair 
have they never read thomas grays elegy written in a country churchyard more than two and a half centuries ago what about economic historian david s landes statement the world has never been a level playing field 
in the joint autobiography of milton friedman and his wife rose they say everywhere in the world there are gross inequities of income and wealth they offend most of us few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others 
moreover professor friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life 
what is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress more important what test of evidence  if any  have they ever subjected their notions to 
no one has presented the social vision of the left more often than nicholas kristof of the new york times  and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision just dont get it as he has repeatedly declared 
mr kristofs essay growing up poor in america in the october th new york times is a classic example of the mindset of the left 
it begins with the story of a poor black teenager in arkansas being raised by a single mom sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book but it does have television sets with huge screens and apparently there is money enough to buy marijuana 
surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him and that this is a human tragedy the circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances moreover he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement 
but that is not enough for mr kristof or for the political left in general of such youngsters he says as a society we fail them long before they fail us 
whoa just when did society make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in and just when did society acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it 
when the left says society they usually mean government that is apparently what society means in this case for kristof laments that this teenager is the kind of person whom americas presidential candidates just dont talk about 
if the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies that is their right but if they expect the rest of us to share that belief surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test but we can however 
the s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to solve what they called social problems how did that work out what were things like before this social vision triumphed and what were things like afterwards 
homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the s and the s but homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the s wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades 
when the s began most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father after the great welfare state expansion during the s most black children were born to a single mother like the youngster in arkansas today 
kristofs essay also mentions a teenage girl who is a single mother and suggests that sex education could have prevented her from getting pregnant teenage pregnancy was going down  repeat down  during the s it reversed and shot up after the s began bringing the sex education vision into schools across the country 
very similar trends occurred in england after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the s perhaps it is the left that just doesnt get it  or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/generic-night-police-lights.jpg?itok=RF7ewDdP,hate,force fanaticism wahhabism saudi arabia beyond,head hillary transition project israel depressing november daniel greenfield hillarys people really dont like israel email like many recent leaks stars neera tanden tanden heads hillarykaine transition project email exchange john podesta head hillary campaign mar pm neera tanden email protected wrote israel depressing good lesson wing nuts ruthless every country john podesta replied bad,1,Real

i am mad i am mad because i am scared and if you are a woman you should be too emailgate is a bitch hunt but the target is not hillary clinton its us 
the only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female can you imagine this happening to a man 
his name was general petraeus thank you have a nice day 
clinton is guilty of swf speaking while female and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what shes doing and must be punished for the sake of all decent women everywhere there is so much of that going around 
that escalated quickly and incoherently also im pretty sure its not the s or whatever decade robin is parodying or channeling but yes hillary clinton is only in this mess because shes a woman it has nothing to do with anything else that must be why albright and rice werent in the center of similar scandals 
if the candidate were male there would be no scolding and no scandal those very ideas would be absurd men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech in theory so do women but that as the creationists like to say is only a theory 
emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech its illegal for both public officials of both genders 
but heres hillary rodham clinton the very public standin for all bossy uppity and ambitious women here are her emails and since its a woman doing what decent women should never doengaging in highlevel public communicationwell there must be something wrong with that even if we cant quite find that something

the sandlers ran world savings bank which was sold to wachovia in  for  billion and which was accused of offering adjustablerate mortgages that contributed to the housing collapse 
saturday night live got into trouble when it depicted the sandlers as people who should be shot time magazine listed them as one of  people to blame for the financial crisis 
in the early s the sandlers world savings bank became the first to sell a tricky home loan called the option arm and they pushed the mortgage which offered several ways to backload your loan and thereby reduce your early payments with increasing zeal and misleading advertisements over the next two decades the couple pocketed  billion when they sold their bank to wachovia in  but losses on world savings loan portfolio led to the implosion of wachovia which was sold under duress late last year to wells fargo 

notorious right wing comedy show saturday night live also featured the sandlers 
on october   however saturday night live aired a skit in which the sandlers were depicted as predatory lenders under their names snl placed the caption people who should be shot compounding the sandlers negative press was a time magazine list that identified them as two of the  people to blame for the financial crisis the new york times also labeled the sandlers pariahs  and on december   the times reportedthat their mortgages were the typhoid mary of the housing crisis on february   cbss  minutes also aired a segment that featured the sandlers world savings bank as one of the primary examples of how the mortgage industry had destroyed itself and unleashed an economic collapse

peter kadzik kept hillarys campaign chief out of jail and he hopes to do the same for her 
hillarys people have gone on the warpath against the fbi their allies are obamas political appointees at the doj and this is who is in their corner 
the justice department official in charge of informing congress about the newly reactivated hillary clinton email probe is a political appointee and former privatepractice lawyer who kept clinton campaign chairman john podesta out of jail lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by president bill clinton and led the effort to confirm attorney general loretta lynch 
peter kadzik who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in june  represented podesta in  when independent counsel kenneth starr was investigating podesta for his possible role in helping exbill clinton intern and mistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
kadziks name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the fbis investigation of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton for using a private homebrewed server after fbi director james comey informed congress on thursday the fbi was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered congressional leaders wrote to the department of justice seeking more information kadzik replied 
we assure you that the department will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible kadzik wrote on oct  
kadzik had been an attorney with dickstein shapiro llp for  years before he represented podesta in the clintonlewinsky investigation he was hired in  as a lobbyist for tax cheat marc rich who was controversially granted a pardon by president bill clinton during clintons final days in office kadzik got the job because he was trusted by white house chief of staff john podesta and was considered to be a useful person to convey marc richs arguments to mr podesta according to a  house oversight committee report

the fbi has an early present for hillary clinton its the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash that fugitive was a fellow by the name of marc rich his prosecutor james comey 
the fbi unexpectedly released  pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in  into president bill clintons pardon of marc rich who had been married to a wealthy democratic donor 
the unusual timing of the release was the result of a freedom of information act request that had been completed and was posted under standard fbi practice according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters but the clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release 
well of course it did its never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you 
the investigation stemmed from one of several pardons clinton made on the last day of his presidency in  that of financier and international fugitive marc rich whose exwife denise had given to the democratic national committee and the entity that would later become the clinton foundation 
and theres a surprise guest 
while the files may seem dated they invoke figures beyond the clintons who went on to play key roles in official washington  including comey 
he served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against rich from  to  as the us attorney in manhattan in  comey took over a criminal investigation of clintons pardons i was stunned at the rich pardon comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-01T23:56:37.271+02:00,lawyer who kept hillary campaign chief out of jail in doj hillary probe,"obamas secret muslim list why enemies of israel and irans goto guy appeared on the list november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
like a warped islamic version of santa claus obama had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments 
it included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood 
it was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them 
obama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american 
when i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror 
we dont have religious tests he insisted 
except we did and we do obama also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between  and  muslim with only  christians and  yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war 
syria is  christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only  have made it past obamas iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence 
but would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test 
of course he would 
the hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees 
the list was sent to john podesta who headed the obamabiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian 
how shameful how not american of barack hussein obama 
most who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta 
religious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians 
thats the pattern which emerged from the obamabiden transition project and obamas refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations 
this policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies 
administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates 
obama appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders 
the muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in  fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood 
he cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati  director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists  its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on obamas muslim list 
also listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state 
the second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised obama on iranian sanctions 
obama had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that obama must apologize for 
the other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout 
eboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the obama administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair 
dilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to obamas advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc 
also on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure 
the recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet obama had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims 
this represents behavior that is in obamas own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles obama is shameful and not american",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/bill-clinton-finger.jpg?itok=-RqjcPGP,hate,hillary already planning fireworks victory celebration,lloyd billingsley presidential debates donald trump hillary clinton included third participant vladimir putin standing background stealthily inserting process putins russia uses deniable cyberhooliganism actively prank american political system taking toll putin playbook steal cheat attack disrupt mislead confuse caught lie deny gets worse unfortunately republican presidential nominee reinforces narrative referring rigged system indictable opponent outbursts follow years domestic political discord comity history crazy seems new normal sitting president heckled lie told piece reads like clinton press release actually putins powerful playbook hack steal disrupt mislead confuse october sacramento bee two days comey email bombshell author markos kounalakis billed senior fellow central european university visiting fellow hoover institution doesnt quite capture man connections clintons shown wikileaks mr kounalakis author line fails reveal married eleni tsakopouloskounalakis daughter realestate tycoon angelo tsakopoulos according greek usa reporter angelo top political donor clintons well democratic party whose donations former president bill clinton rewarded night prestigious lincoln bedroom tsakopoulos confirmed hillary clinton seek democratic nomination next presidential election angelos daughter eleni protégé nancy pelosi barbara boxer raised million hillary clinton money found reward january us secretary state hillary clinton swore tsakopouloskounalakis us ambassador hungary capacity condemned wikileaks releasing secret diplomatic cables declined comment authenticity material tsakopouloskounalakis served ambassador wikileaks confirms continued key clinton supporter best beat back presidential run joe biden june email eleni tsakopoulos kounalakis tells john podesta bay area bagman swears biden running said took air force two hes getting emails last july tsakopouloskounalakis emailed clinton confidant jake sullivan hrc indicated view would best avoid grexit july email sullivan john podesta huma abedin supports terms allow greece stay eurozone october tsakopoulos kounalakis emailed podesta greek american love fest going joe biden boyclub day emailed podesta huma abedin david brock dinner annie karni politico asked use four quotes see attached told first two could attribution second two without emails john podesta humba abedin reveal ambassador eleni kounalakis styles remains part hillary clintons inner circle tellingly mcclatchytribune newspapers run husbands columns acknowledge strong clinton connection new york times proclaimed kounalakis white knight rescuing washington monthly served publisher teamed editor paul glastris tandem made publication progressive mustread according clinton strategist james carville kounalakis reported newsweek east germany ran bureau prague also worked moscow nbc radio mutual news kounalakis books include hope tattered flag voices postbush era peter laufer beyond spin power strategic corporate journalism drew banks kim daus remains something mystery leftist kounalakis became visiting fellow hoover institution known strong conservative writers scholars thomas sowell victor davis hanson bruce thornton one time writer recalls kounalakis acknowledged print wifes strong clinton connections even wikileaks revelations presidential election days away kounalakis acknowledge wifes key role hrcs inner circle john podesta huma abedin october sacramento bee piece suggests markos right home circles kounalakis attacks republican presidential nominee implying crazy tool evil putin hand clinton email scandal gets zero attention author piles ad copy american society made great strides lgbtq rights womens rights minority rights relatively strong resilient globally innovative economy author gives readers good cause regard article pure clinton campaign propaganda camouflaged clinton crony maybe markos join wife huma abedin john podesta wikileaks revelations many observers issue leaks came whether revelations true authentic markos kounalakis believes bogus maybe write whats real ones,1,Real

theres no doubt that comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying not because it is unprecedented as the democrats keep squealing they had no such qualms when the weekend before the  election special prosecutor lawrence walsh indicted a pollsurging george hw bush for his alleged involvement in the irancontra scandal no the mystery is comeys motives is comey like conrads lord jim now sacrificing his fbi careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office reputation and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled fbi investigators to quote one of our candidates at this point what difference does it make 
the real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters right now we dont know if the content of the  emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter anthony weiner estranged husband of clinton vizier huma abedin will reveal something damning like say classified materials but we already know that clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server which didnt bother comey back in july so what could be in these new emails that rises above comeys sophistic extreme carelessness and reaches the statutes gross negligence or has comey found new evidence of hillarys intent his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law there had to be something that made comey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the democrats 
whatever is found on the abedin laptop one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters they have shrugged off so many scandals lies and failures that should have sunk a candidacy that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence unpleasantness dishonesty sleaze and crime is disqualifying anymore here are the greatest hits from hillarys catalogue whitewater missing billing records from her tenure at the rose law firm renting out the lincoln bedroom to donors travelgate illegal possession of fbi files conducting illegal secret meetings of the task force on national health care reform cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering stealing  worth of china furniture and artwork from the white house claiming she landed under sniper fire in bosnia claiming she and bill left the white house dead broke shaking down wall street while assuring the orcs of capitalism that shes got their back charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides calling  missing emails personal communications lying about the benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead americans families supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure internet video when she knew the same night that they werent perjuring herself before congress and the fbi about the emails and her private server the disastrous overthrow of ghaddafi in libya the disastrous reset with russia the disastrous nuclear deal with iran the disastrous withdrawal from iraq the corrupt clinton foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary the paytoplay state department using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planets most brutally misogynistic regimes serially flipflopping on issues like samesex marriage the trans pacific trade deal and the keystone pipeline promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work her campaign staffs dirty tricks against trump and his supporters her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions and last but not least the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health 
back in the day just a few of these gaffes deceptions and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for congress let alone the white house 
and mr trumps offenses hes talks exactly as youd expect a new york real estate developer casino owner reality television star and beauty pageant mogul to talk hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what bill clinton and every whitehousevisiting rapper movie star or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity when youre a star they let you do it as trump bragged of his crude sexual advances hes ignorant of policy he doesnt understand the economics of global trade he doesnt know what the nuclear triad is hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives he wants to build a wall with mexico he takes legal advantage of tax law hes not suitable for office he does not have the right temperament hes used bankruptcy as a business tool hes accused of groping over a dozen women including a polymorphously perverse porn star hes mean and insulting he has orange hair 
in short trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices just ask hillarys various secret service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be 
the voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous but whatever happens its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates 
this transformation happened decades before trump and hillary came along after bill clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the white house his approval ratings were  he left the white house with a  rating higher than any president since harry truman including ronald reagan think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the soviet union into its own dustbin of history 
that was the inflection point for our political culture no wonder that barack obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement leftwing views selfconfessed drug use friends like the antiamerican racist jeremiah wright and unrepentant terrorist bill ayers and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to  million voters so why now are we shocked shocked that offbrand candidates like hillary clinton and donald trump are vying for the presidency decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue wisdom and decorum have already long gone 
so absent a smoking howitzer in the next wikileaks dump comeys restart of the investigation which in any case will take months to complete will probably not be the gamechanging october surprise many hope for and others dread especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate then again the rapid erosion of hillarys support is drawing analogies to reagans late surge against carter 
either way on november  most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me or they might just finally realize that hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable but what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/big-sister-600x337.jpg?itok=GO9AqWjs,hate,obamas secret muslim list,search

presidential debates between donald trump and hillary clinton included a third participant vladimir putin standing in the background stealthily inserting himself in the process putins russia uses deniable cyberhooliganism to actively prank the american political system and its taking a toll   this is the putin playbook steal cheat attack disrupt mislead confuse if caught lie and deny and it gets worse 
unfortunately the republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative referring to a rigged system and an indictable opponent his outbursts follow years of domestic political discord where comity is history crazy seems the new normal and a sitting president can be heckled with you lie 
all told the piece reads like a clinton press release but its actually putins powerful playbook hack steal disrupt mislead confuse in the october  sacramento bee  two days after the comey email bombshell the author is markos kounalakis billed as a senior fellow at central european university and visiting fellow at the hoover institution that doesnt quite capture the man and his connections with the clintons which have shown up in wikileaks 
mr kounalakis author line fails to reveal that he is married to eleni tsakopouloskounalakis daughter of realestate tycoon angelo tsakopoulos according to greek usa reporter  angelo is a top political donor to the clintons as well as the democratic party whose donations to former president bill clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious lincoln bedroom in  tsakopoulos confirmed that hillary clinton will seek the democratic nomination in the next presidential election 
angelos daughter eleni a protégé of nancy pelosi and barbara boxer  raised more than  million for hillary clinton in   and that money found its reward on january   us secretary of state hillary clinton swore in tsakopouloskounalakis as us ambassador to hungary in that capacity  she condemned wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables but declined comment on the authenticity of the material tsakopouloskounalakis served as ambassador until  but as wikileaks confirms she continued as a key clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by joe biden 
in a june   email eleni tsakopoulos kounalakis tells john podesta that a bay area bagman swears biden is running he said he took him on air force two and hes getting emails last july tsakopouloskounalakis emailed clinton confidant jake sullivan that hrc indicated her view that it would be best to avoid grexit and a july   email to sullivan john podesta and huma abedin she supports terms that will allow greece to stay in the eurozone 
on october   tsakopoulos kounalakis emailed podesta that there is a greek american love fest going on with joe biden very boyclub the same day she emailed podesta and huma abedin that we had a david brock dinner with annie karni from politico she asked to use four quotes from me see attached i told her the first two could be with attribution and the second two without 
as the emails to john podesta and humba abedin reveal ambassador eleni kounalakis as she styles herself remains part of hillary clintons inner circle tellingly the mcclatchytribune newspapers that run her husbands columns do not acknowledge the strong clinton connection 
the new york times proclaimed kounalakis a white knight for rescuing washington monthly  where he served as publisher and teamed with editor paul glastris this tandem made the publication a progressive mustread according to clinton strategist james carville kounalakis reported for newsweek in east germany and ran their bureau in prague he also worked in moscow for nbc radio and mutual news 
kounalakis books include hope is a tattered flag voices for the postbush era  with peter laufer and beyond spin the power of strategic corporate journalism with drew banks and kim daus it remains something of a mystery how the leftist kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the hoover institution known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as thomas sowell victor davis hanson and bruce thornton 
only one time as this writer recalls has kounalakis acknowledged in print his wifes strong clinton connections even after the wikileaks revelations and with a presidential election only days away kounalakis did not acknowledge his wifes key role in hrcs inner circle with john podesta and huma abedin his october  sacramento bee piece suggests markos is right at home in those circles 
kounalakis attacks the republican presidential nominee implying that he is crazy and a tool of the evil putin on the other hand the clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy american society has made great strides in lgbtq rights womens rights and minority rights and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy 
the author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged clinton crony maybe markos will join his wife huma abedin and john podesta in the wikileaks revelations for many observers the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic if markos kounalakis believes they are bogus maybe he can write about whats in the real ones",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/unnamed.jpg?itok=a6-nUXE5,hate,james comey change

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-02T06:45:41.336+02:00,obamas secret muslim list,"search form search from bad to worse  obamas ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg in his bid to pursue a legacy obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon november   ari lieberman 
most of us including several democratic lawmakers cringed when obama inked the iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the iranian regime recoiled in horror when we learned that obama transferred  million to the iranians in exchange for four american citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges the  million was part of a larger installment totaling  billion ostensibly to settle claims iran had against the united states stemming from aborted iranian arms purchases dating back to the shah obama claimed that this was money that was owed to iran and the settlement which included  billion in interest saved the us taxpayer billions because the iranians were demanding even more at the hague tribunal where the claim was being adjudicated 
the timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geopolitical concerns the americans were freed only after iran received its  million the payment which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane was made in untraceable cash stacked on wooden pallets the iranians demanded swiss francs and euros rather than dollars and a pliant obama agreed to the islamic republics dictates gleeful iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom contradicting the administrations adamant denials 
even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom state department spokesman mark toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the  million was used as leverage to ensure the americans safe return the white house however quickly repudiated the state departments characterization 
even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the us to extortion and hostagetaking the iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not every twobit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well 
but there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story in his january   address to the american people obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the islamic republic but as noted by rick richman in an excellent article featured in mosaic  the deal struck with the iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the american people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement 
the  million that the us transferred to iran came from irans foreign military sales fms account with the pentagon the balance of  billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since  but obama neglected to note that when iran filed its lawsuit the us filed counterclaim against iran for  million for iranian breaches of its obligations under the fms program the us could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the american treasury courtesy of the islamic republic 
moreover american plaintiffs maintained sixteen us court judgments against the islamic republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities those judgments totaled  billion in compensatory and punitive damages 
some plaintiffs sought to recover their judgments directly from irans fms account but their efforts were stymied by the clinton administration instead under a convoluted deal struck between congress and the clinton administration in  the us treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and  percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the fms fund the judgments would then be subrogated to the united states which meant that judgments became direct us claims against the iranian government 
iran ignored the judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs under us law the  million sitting in the fms account should have gone back to the us treasury which had already paid the judgment holders but the us treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to iran essentially the us taxpayer ended up footing the bill for irans terrorism while the iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence 
obamas actions represented blatant disregard for the law for the victims of terrorism and for the american taxpayer his claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity 
obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures but as noted by richman the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle iranian claims instituted at the hague exposing yet another lie by the obama administration 
there was one and only one reason why the iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is the iranians are the worlds foremost statesponsors of international terrorism they finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing hence they demanded untraceable cash the misery that we are currently witnessing in syria yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the obama administration which provided the iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing 
in addition to the  billion in cash obama also authorized the release of seven convicted iranian felons and expunged warrants on  others but this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal 
lastly the transfer of such a large sum to iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing loretta lynchs signature authorizing such payment on october  sen marco rubio r fla and rep mike pompeo r kan presented lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal lynch whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries 
in a desperate attempt to establish a legacy obama pursued the iran deal with reckless abandon forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in us diplomatic history the ancillary deal struck with the iranians concerning american hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the iranians to continue their reign or regional terror more importantly it may also have been in violation of existing us law and lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that

Bruce Thornton,2016-11-02T06:45:42.060+02:00,will james comey change the outcome of the election,"netanyahus critical foreign tour israels strategic repositioning 
originally published by the jerusalem post  
prime minister benjamin netanyahus upcoming trips to australia singapore kazakhstan and azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office the trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it the states that he will visit are all wellpositioned to help israel navigate its next moves the first shift is the uss political crackup 
next week american voters will choose their next president the major candidates democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land their rise is a testament to the weakening if not the unraveling of the glue that has held america together since the civil war the unraveling of the us electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of us military power the uss multitrillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the middle east over the past  years has come at the expense of military modernization the f program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds and it has yet to produce a reliable airplane worse the fs long and problematic gestation period has given russia and china the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the fs stealth systems those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the us and its allies the deterioration of the uss military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the uss apparent loss of strategic rationality this is apparent worldwide but is nowhere more obvious than in the middle east president barack obamas decision to effectively abandon the uss major allies in the middle east in favor of cultivating ties with iran has made the region far more dangerous to the us and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago true in theory obamas decision to prefer the shiites to the sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of sunni jihadism but in light of the genocidal totalitarian and imperial nature of the current iranian regime his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive moreover obamas willingness to rack up the uss national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup in other words even under the best circumstances it is hard to imagine that the us will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade the implications for israel are far reaching for decades israels strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on us power this strategic posture is no longer tenable the second major international shift is russias sudden rise as the primary global power in the middle east as channel  reported sunday night russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of israels air and naval operations in a matter of months israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades the air force reportedly is convinced that the fs stealth systems will be able to neutralize russias detection capabilities but given the welldocumented current problems with the fs stealth systems this conviction is unwise and even under the best circumstances in which israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its f without american interference it will take israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving russian systems present to our air force according to channel s report air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events rather than panicking though israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation the obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that russias military primacy does not reach specifically israel needs to expand massively its capacity for undertheradar operations the first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities particularly human intelligence capabilities israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region second israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies ability to strike us israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems israels reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies military chain of command as possible if our offensive capabilities are being checked so must the capabilities of our enemies indeed our enemies need to be subverted part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in iran at the same time israel should be empowering antiregime sectors in iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the  islamic revolution third israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores it needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment and it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of russian regional primacy fourth israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power it needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with asia such economic growth and power will positively influence russias willingness to allow israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies  and russias allies in lebanon syria and beyond in other words the more economically powerful israel is the more russia will be willing to side with israel against hezbollah and

Lloyd Billingsley,2016-11-02T06:45:42.828+02:00,hillarymediamolecon,"the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos where are the condemnations of the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel november   
originally written for the investigative project on terrorism 
israeli human rights group btselem recently appeared before a special session of the united nations security council excoriating israel and pleading with the body to act against israels settlements 
in  the un famously declared that zionism is racism and four decades later the organization continues to hound israel in each of the last four years as the syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning israel as those rebuking the rest of the world 
the uns cultural body unesco recently passed a motion ignoring any jewish or christian historical ties to east jerusalem holy sites referring to the temple mount and western wall only by their muslim names and condemning israel as the occupying power it turns out that some of israels leftwing ngos worked to help produce the unesco motion 
given the uns chronic hostility efforts by israeli ngos to persuade the un to act against israel are arguably treasonous indeed one attorney and activist for israels leftleaning labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against btselem arguing that the ngo has harmed state sovereignty tried to give land away to a foreign entity and taken steps that could cause a war 
israeli democracy is extremely tolerant to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups last march several israeli arab knesset members condemned arab states for labeling hizballah a terrorist organization even though it has been at war with israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities 
last february members from the joint arab list paid a solidarity visit to relatives of palestinian terrorists whom israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering israelis in  mk hanin zoabi balad drew praise from hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing israeli youths were not terrorists hamass connection to the young mens abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between israel and hamas in gaza 
thus israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention nevertheless foreign interests have identified israeli ngos as the soft underbelly of israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas the problem became so acute that a watchdog ngo monitor was formed in  to track the selfhostility being funded largely by european and other foreign sources as the organization notes ngos lack a system of checks and balances andprovide accountability to their funders and activist members and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities 
ngo monitor also notes that even though most of the foreign government funding for these israeli ngos is formally designated for educating the israeli public and changing public opinion both in violation of the norms on noninterference in other democracies these israeli ngos are very active externally in the delegitmization and political warfare against israel 
these leftwing israeli ngos receive money from about two dozen foreign governments  and some private organizations  that includes millions of dollars from billionaire george soros 
in catch the jew  author tuvia tenenbom exposed how foreignfunded human rights and cultural organizations in israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking israel by presenting himself to interview subjects as tobi the german tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions for example the new fund for cinema and tv a foreignfunded israeli cultural ngo told him that that about  percent of political documentaries made in israel are coproduced by europeans that includes a documentary called what makes a hero which equates israels military with the nazis such films would be too scandalous to be produced in germany but germansponsored ngos can safely pay leftwing israelis to make such movies 
some foreign funders of israeli ngos have even unwittingly enriched hamas last august hamas allegedly siphoned off tens of millions of dollars from world vision a usbased charity and used the funds for weapons purchases tunnel construction and other military activities 
the knesset passed a law in july requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for ngos that get more than half of their money from overseas the law is clearly aligned with the american foreign agents registration act fara wrote legal scholar eugene kontorovich who defended the legislation in response to critics 
israel is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups he wrote for example the european union alone has in recent years given roughly  million euro a year for political ngos in the us and roughly an order of magnitude more in israela vastly larger per capita amount 
the obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view obama opposed netanyahus speech to the us congress against the iranian nuclear deal but was happy to give a speech to the uk parliament against brexit the obama administration critiqued israels ngofundingdisclosure law  perhaps because it had sent us taxpayer money to an israeli ngo working to oust israels prime minister 
the same hypocrisy seems to prevail among israels foreignfunded ngos they ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful coexistence but are conspicuously silent when palestinian institutions violate those ideals such silence enables abuse by palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which israelis operate foreignfunded israeli ngos remained silent after the palestinian authority arrested palestinians who visited a sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence 
these organizations are silent when the palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them netanyahu said these organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights but only in shaming israel and libeling it around the world 
if israels leftwing ngos truly are committed to democracy and peace why havent they condemned the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel in  jibril rajoub the deputy secretary of the fatah central committee and the head of the palestinian supreme council for sport and youth affairs condemned a coexistencepromoting soccer match between israeli and palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz as a crime against humanity 
last week a palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with israeli defense minister avigdor liberman the jerusalembased newspaper alquds was denounced by hamas  the palestinian journalists syndicate and the supposedly moderate pa the chilling effects and antipeace message implicit in the harsh reactions to the interview have yet to catch the attention of any leftwing ngos supposedly working for peace and democracy",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/1280px-barack_obama_speaks_in_cairo_egypt_06-04-09-930x620.jpg?itok=O8HTNTWo,hate,netanyahus critical foreign tour,black voters turning hillary november black voters helped hillary beat bernie theyre turning early voting neither millennials sunday nights polls closed black vot ers accounted percent inperson early vote ballots cast included five previous days inperson early voting two days inperson early voting blacks cast percent early ballots according dan smith university florida political science professor published early voting data mustread election smith blog due strong africanamerican turnout beginning inperson early voting democrats began outpacing republicans total ballots cast election day year though republicans still cling lead monday morning million absentee inperson early ballots cast percent republicans percent democrats hillary getting latino support largely due immigration debate doesnt hot sauce draw husband obama leaves dependent white voters forces zigzag moderate extreme positions adds reputation untrustworthiness,1,Real

Noah Beck,2016-11-02T06:45:44.129+02:00,the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos,"fbi investigates saudi wifeabusing clinton foundation donor in straw donor scheme november   daniel greenfield 
its midnight in america and the clintons and the democratic party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory im sure the line on this will be that the fbi is acting inappropriately by investigating this investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected 
the fbi is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy saudi family that supports democratic florida senate candidate patrick murphy 
murphy who has covered himself in glory so often already is denying everything and i mean absolutely everything 
the murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the fbi probe 
whats your name i decline to answer that question 
murphy  is running against rubio the incumbent republican in a race that could help decide which party controls the senate in  rubio currently leads murphy by an average of  percentage points according to realclearpolitics 
the fbi investigation however relates to murphys first run for the house in the  campaign cycle 
the allegation  originally submitted by a republican super pac run by a former top aide to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky  is that murphys high school friend and major political donor ibrahim alrashid coordinated a straw donor scheme to boost murphy 
murphy knows nothing 
murphys campaign declined to say whether murphys attorneys had discussed the fbi investigation with alrashids attorney 
uhhuh 
alrashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected saudi billionaire hes been a major financial benefactor of murphys giving almost  to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the florida congressman 
heres how some of these donations worked 
one example within the alleged scheme a woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the owner and property manager of a texasbased company limestone property management gave murphys campaign  
but she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the texasbased company in fact she doesnt work there 
she lived in miami at the time and was ibrahim alrashids cleaning lady according to a miamidade police department report filed in  over a home burglary at alrashids property 
texas property manager vs saudis cleaning lady thats quite a difference 
murphy has been forced to return alrashids donations before for purely islamophobic reasons 
alrashids three sons have followed in their fathers political footsteps contributing large sums to top democrats including rep patrick murphy d fla whose senate race could help decide which party controls the senate in  
murphy has already returned a portion of alrashids donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident 
ibrahim alrashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wifes pennsylvania home where alrashid allegedly grabbed her by the wrist struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground according to a copy of the police report viewed by the free beacon 
following the  incident alrashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating i am not sorry this time i hope you die in hell according to the police report 
murphy a longtime friend of alrashid was recently forced to donate around  in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign murphy also returned all of the donations made by alrashid during the last three political cycles 
is the clinton foundation involved in this do the clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets 
nasser alrashid one of saudi arabias wealthiest figures and an adviser to the countrys royal family has donated somewhere between  million to  million to the clinton foundation putting him in an elite category of prominent donors

college is now a politically correct joke  
suffolk universitys interim president said tuesday that the college will hold mandatory microaggression training for all faculty in response to an outcry last week after a latina student wrote a viral blog post saying she was the victim of a professors racial bias 
what did this racial bias involve 
tiffany martinezsaid an unidentified suffolk sociology professor handed back a paper she had written and in front of the class and told martinez this is not your language insinuating that martinez had plagiarized 
martinez posted a photo of the paper on her blog showing where the professor appears to have written please go back and indicate where you cut and paste the professor had circled the word hence in the paper and wrote this is not your word 
in this interaction my undergraduate career was both challenged and critiqued the student wrote it is worth repeating how my professor assumed i could not use the word hence a simple transitory word that connected two relating statements the professor assumed i could not produce quality research 
most college students regardless of whether their ancestors originated from southern europe or not do not tend to use hence in a sentence hence its the sort of word that professors seize on and suspect that what they are seeing is cut and paste material tiffanys interaction has happened thousands of times with students regardless of race 
but tiffany is lucky enough to be a privileged minority which means that she cant be treated like everyone else lest she whine about it and a flood of social justice crybullies descend on suffolk u 
kelly the interim president also sent a note to the school on friday after the buzzfeed article was posted 
the truth is that all of us here at suffolk should be concerned about any student feeling this way kelly wrote in her tuesday blog post she said the school has experienced an outpouring of support for martinez from other students faculty and staff 
privilege this is what it looks like 
scholars and rogues fights a last stand against the decline and fall of journalism by stating the obvious  
in short what we have here isnt merely iffy reporting on an academic dustup its a microcosm of what has happened to journalism in modern america these headlines are certain to entice web surfers to click and if the reporters can so easily be suckered into outrage then how can we possibly expect a rational reading by the average product of the american ed system which has been stripped of all pretense at teaching critical thinking 
the result an emotionally pitched unsubstantiated claim of injustice has been instantly transformed into cold hard fact

parents who plan on refinancing their homes in order to send their children off to college should instead consider encouraging them to specialize in a trade 
speaking as a phd in philosophy who has spent the last  years teaching at the college level im perhaps the last person from whom advice of this sort is expected but it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that i beseech the college bound and their enablersi mean their supportersto revisit their plans 
whether one regards a postsecondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any more specifically it is a bastion of political correctness a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition 
for the last  years professor duke pesta who is currently an associate professor of english at the university of wisconsin oshkosh has taught literature at a range of colleges at the outset of each semester he would quiz his students on their knowledge of american and western history what he found is that the overwhelming number of them believed that slaveryan institution mind you that is as old as humanity itself was practiced in virtually every society the planet over and that lasted only some  years in the united states was an exclusively american phenomenon  
most of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of america pesta told the college fix his students are convinced that slavery was an american problem that more or less ended with the civil war and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the colonial era 
their entire education about slavery he adds was confined to america 
yet it isnt just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery over at boston university saida grundy  an assistant professor of sociology and africanamerican studies tweeted that slavery is a white peoplething 
grundy didnt stop there she asks is white peoples new deflection from dealing with slavery that all races have had slaves thing is this the new alllivesmatter 
professor grundy added other enlightening tweets 
for the record no race outside of europeans had a system that made slavery a personhood instead of temporary condition 
there is also no race except europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life 
before europeans invented it as such slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child 
in case white folks couldnt follow the thrust of her rant grundy offers a summation of her sophisticated position 
in other words deal with your white sht white people slavery is a yall thing 
in addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white europeans grundy claimed that white masculinity is the problem for americas colleges 
over at the university of pittsburgh students who were distributing prodonald trump materials were harassed and attacked  the trump supporters were accused of backing a racist candidate who espouses hate speech they were greeted by chants of fk the white male patriarchy and eventually physical aggression 
one of the victims said that my campus shouldnt be a place where my friends and i are fearful for having opposing opinions 
these students were accosted by other students students elsewhere however have had professors with which to contend 
at the university of california at los angeles ucla a political science professor michael chwe wrote in a blog post for princeton university press that the danger to democracy itself is posed by trump supporters this danger is real and must be confronted chwe maintains that trump and his supporters are the greatest danger to democracy since world war ii even perhaps since the civil war 
chwe thinks that had we done a better and earlier job with confronting as opposed to accommodating white and male privilegewe might not have reached this situation the trump phenomenon we must set our sights on combatting these forms of privilege now though if we hope to divert democracy away from selfdestruction 
and it isnt just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that cant resist injecting their politics into the classroom a math professor at mount holyoke college an allfemale school was recently captured on video launching into an antitrumpproclinton tirade in class while he never referred to either candidate by name peter rosnicks choice for president was plain this election rosnick said is the scariest that hes ever witnessed he told his students that they should vote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of um should not be objectified 
rosnick also prescribed his students to vote for whoever you want but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrantsthat this is a country that couldnt that wouldnt be what it is if it wasnt for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country 
at least one of rosnicks students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts speaking on condition of anonymity this student told the college fix that she found it highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for 
indeed 
but this unfortunately is hardly an anomaly in  thus parents should think hard before divesting themselves of tens and tens of thousands of dollars so that their children can become targets of

nothing ought to be plainer and yet nothing is more obscured than the meaning of the islamic concept of jihad even if its meaning were at all unclear every day islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is the confusion arises of course from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign making books such as william kilpatricks the politically incorrect guide to jihad so vitally necessary 
kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book which not only explains from islamic texts and teachings why isis and boko haram and other jihad terror groups are not only not unislamic as is frequently claimed but quintessentially islamic  for the quran as kilpatrick explains commands jihad and muhammad who is considered in islamic theology to the perfect man to be imitated by muslims whenever wherever and however possible not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself 
kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation  notably the question of why if islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of islamic law most muslims are peaceful peaceful islam kilpatrick points out which western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists is a holdover from the longdead colonial era indeed so the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers who werent going away in the foreseeable future once they did abscond however the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed and saudifunded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling muslims back to jihad the forgotten obligation of warfare against unbelievers 
the politically incorrect guide to jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among muslims or discrimination against them and indeed that no conciliation or concession on the part of western nonmuslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative since it is rooted in islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds 
the most valuable sections however of this useful and engaging book are the second jihad without bombs and the third defeating jihad for even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the western landscape more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that western governments indefatigably pursue and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered and usually prevented outright honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat kilpatrick points out that according to reporters without borders the us has dropped to fortysixth place in press freedom one of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat and its ongoing campaign every time there is a jihad attack to inundate us with articles explaining that islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence nothing at all 
but kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting the churches are in on the act as well christians writes kilpatrick have been lulled into complacency by the oftrepeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of muslims  an emphasis all too many church leaders including of course pope francis relentlessly hammer home heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually spiritually and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat 
thats why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed strategies for victory first weve got to get serious the west suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could in the end be fatal the frivolity is at the top fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media the government and the church are fostering for their own ends the politically incorrect guide to jihad is the perfect book for those who dont know just how bad things are and how likely they are to get even worse  as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness it can be done william kilpatrick does it quite well in this

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
once upon a time factchecking meant that newspapers radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead 
but factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the roman empire errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty there is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting 
the media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures the fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents the media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others 
fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate these days theyre only expected to be politically correct the media deploys fact checks to check political correctness not facts its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan but subjective matters of opinion 
consider politicos often mocked fact check of donald trump as to whether isis was indeed unbelievably evil under a banner headline donald trumps week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths it zoomed in on a quote from his florida rally 
were presiding over something that the world has not seen the level of evil is unbelievable trump had said 
politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check judging one level of evil against another is subjective but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as isis 
there were no facts being checked here because politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is 
the only information conveyed by this fact check is that politico like the rest of the media does not like donald trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue 
in the daily show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility 
the isis evil fact check of trump came from the same media outlet whose white house reporter decided that the wisconsin flag which carries the date  to mark the states admission to the union was a flag for the local union wisconsin  politico ran an entire story asserting that obama was flying a labor flag to oppose governor walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history 
this is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to republicans rather than to themselves 
factchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism like objectivity which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose edward r murrow is jon stewart todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on twitter aspire to found their own vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative 
fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks thats why the washington post decided to fact check a saturday night live gag about obamas illegal alien amnesty its not that anyone imagines that saturday night live is in the business of producing facts that need checking the post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt obama and his agenda 
its the same reason that the paper fact checked a yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by obama on twitter this isnt about the facts its paranoia about social media narratives going viral 
this is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives 
media outlets trade on their history but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way 
the new yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts but what use is such a thing at david remnicks new yorker whose big draw comes from andy borowitzs insipid near parodies the new republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog cbs news cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on hillarys face to help her cope with stress 
this isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda leftwing journalism like most leftwing culture is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism the soviet union was quite fond of culture it just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of communist ideology the left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda 
its this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked when fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves first facts and then fact checks became meaningless unable to even recognize a fact media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity 
the average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults 
at the washington post  michelle yee fact checks donald trumps comment that hillarys email scandal is bigger than watergate and concludes that since watergate led to nixons resignation and hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions it cant be bigger than watergate since the scandal has yet to be resolved a fact check of it could only take place in the future 
cnn featured toronto star fact checker daniel dale who claimed that trump said  lies in one day 
the list of lies included deeming trumps statement that hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that hillary clinton had received debate questions some of these lies are themselves lies others like yee show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false 
just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when hillary clinton pleaded at the debate please fact checkers get to work her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking that was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center 
nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks but the biggest fact checking department of the media rather than by the media isnt in the united states but in germany in america fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless

the obama department of justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the democratic partys presidential nominee hillary clinton to escape legal accountability for her actions from attorney general loretta lynch on down through the justice departments political ranks the department has blocked the fbi from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion whether it is hillarys use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state or her involvement in the payforplay clinton enterprise known as the clinton foundation the obama administration is applying a banana republicstyle double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her 
lynch and president obama were reportedly furious with fbi director james comey for sending a letter to congress on october  th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the email case had come to light which required further investigation this evidence consisted of a batch of emails fbi investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to anthony weiner clinton confidante huma abedins estranged husband while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving weiners alleged sexting to an underage girl comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let hillary off the hook in the email case last july he was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from fbi agents who felt betrayed by that decision 
department of justice officials had leaned on comey not to send the letter to congress claiming that it would violate department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election to his credit comey ignored the department officials objections claiming he had an obligation to keep the congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case 
democrats who had lavished praise on comey for his july decision lashed out at comey for sending his letter updating congress senate minority leader harry reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that comey may have violated the law by informing congress because reid argued he appeared to be taking sides in an election the disgraced former attorney general eric holder held in contempt of congress for withholding information relating to the fast and furious scandal said about comeys action i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is up to the director to correct his mistake  not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the american people 
since when has holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the american people holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust with his blatant politicization of the obama department of justice as evidenced by the obama department of justices handling of the multiple fbi investigations involving hillary clinton the department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption it interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in hillarys favor ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed obama and preserve his legacy 
first the department of justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the email case or in connection with the fbis investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said  thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that 
kallstroms belief that lynch acted to influence the results of the fbi probes in hillarys favor is buttressed by lynchs  minute private tarmac meeting with bill clinton shortly before fbi director comey faced the cameras on july  th with his exculpatory announcement 
second at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the email case including to hillarys lawyer and confidante cheryl mills and to platte river networks paul combetta it appears that combetta had previously lied to government investigators  a crime in itself  while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently bleachbited emails to delete them even though they had been subject to a previously issued congressional subpoena the immunity agreements garnered nothing in return but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the fbis separate clinton foundation investigation apparently the department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant rather than granting useless immunities in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the email investigation that might have been contained in those devices 
third the department and fbi did not conduct their last minute interview of hillary clinton under oath and allowed cheryl mills  herself a material witness  to sit in during hillarys interview they did not ask pertinent followup questions there was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of hillarys statements during the interview against her sworn congressional testimony or her many public statements 
fourth the department of justice reportedly refused to allow the fbi to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations in fact senior department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough fbi investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while hillary was secretary of state their true motivations and any favors extended by the state department in return 
finally the crossconnections between the clintons and some high level department of justice and fbi officials cry out for recusal but not so in this administration for example the wife of the deputy fbi director who was involved in the laggard clinton foundation investigation andrew mccabe just happened to have received a large donation from close clinton ally virginia governor terry mcauliffe to her  run for the state senate 
to make matters worse the obama department of justice assigned assistant attorney general peter j kadzik a close friend of hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta to communicate with congress about what kadzik promised would be a thorough review of the newly discovered emails from anthony weiners online account 
podesta praised kadzik in an email to an obama campaign official back in  as a fantastic lawyer and said about his pal kept me out of jail their history together goes further back than that during the waning days of bill clintons presidency it was kadzik then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive marc rich who lobbied podesta then serving as bill clintons chief of staff for a presidential pardon on his clients behalf kadziks lobbying effort no doubt helped along by contributions to hillary clintons senate campaign and to bill clintons presidential library paid off bill clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office 
kadzik joined the department of justice in april  first as a deputy assistant attorney general for legislative affairs and then as the principal deputy with the podesta connection intact kadzik has served as a highly placed clinton campaign mole in the department an email dated may   from kadzik to podesta released by wikileaks  proves the point bearing the subject heading heads up kadzik advised podesta about upcoming congressional testimony by the head of the departments civil division and about another filing in the freedom of information case that would mean it will be awhile  before the state department posts the emails podesta forwarded kadziks heads up email to several senior hillary clinton campaign officials with the admonition additional chances for mischief 
exploiting his coordinating role in the reopened email investigation and contacts with fbi investigators kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal podesta and to provide inside information to the clinton campaigns supporters in congress as well

if youre wondering why team hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the fbi this may be another ingredient in the stew the wall street journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the fbi but its an interesting data point  
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics like presenting evidence to a grand jury because the person who was secretly recorded wasnt inside the clinton foundation 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
in short fbi people had material for a case that the government didnt want brought because team obama were hillary backers and the senior leadership in the doj saw their careers linked to the rise of hillary and so a stand down order was handed down 
following the february meeting officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said 
this is what happens when the doj has been so thoroughly corrupted from the top down 
meanwhile theres little doubt considering what we already know that the doj people had been updating hillarys people on the fbi investigation should those emails come out they will be some of the most damning of all and so hillarys people panicked and decided to pull the trigger",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hillary_clinton3_3.jpg?itok=3x78hwU5,hate,brexit ruling latest tactic block people,stalinist monsters bestow blessing november humberto fontova hillarys hourthe hope defeating donald trump hillary clintonthe difference two candidates vast barack obama exaggerate claimed better prepared us president even wasor husband bill clinton stalinist cubas kgbfounded mentored media organ cubadebate oct day winning ringing endorsement communist massmurdering terror sponsors craved came within whisker nuking nation would considered asset us presidential candidate nation worldand even us normal timesdonald trump would find either prison mental institution day threatened prison torture even figuratively enemy stalinist regime jailed tortured political prisoners many us citizens higher rate stalin great terror would considered enormous asset us presidential candidate ringing communist endorsement hillary clinton gets even better hillary clinton hope detaining barbarism warns eunuch scribe totalitarian regime murdered cubans first three years power hitler murdered germans first six process converted highlycivilized immigrantswamped nation slumsewer hemispheres highest suicide rate ravaged tropical diseases tens thousands died trying escape alley cats constitute delicacy oxcarts represent luxury transportation occasions trump even suggested assassination hillary clinton warn notorious assassins suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging camilo cienfuegos tony de la guardia manuel barbarroja pineiro yes castro regime devoured children even voraciously even lenin stalins news dominated revelationssome videoshowing trumps obscenity male chauvinist conductalong treatment women sex objects warns stalinist regime jailed tortured cuban women political crimes totalitarian horror utterly unknown western hemisphere castro brothers che guevara took power cuban ladies suffered twice long castros gulag alexander solzhenitsyn suffered stalins prison conditions described former political prisoner maritza lugo punishment cells measure feet wide feet long toilet consists inch hole ground cockroaches rats enter especially cool temperatures rat come inside seek warmth bodies often bitten suicide rate among women prisoners high christmas eve cuban woman named juana diaz figueroa spat face executioners binding gagging castro che guevaras kgbtrained secret police found guilty feeding hiding bandits cuban rednecks took arms fight stalinist theft land build sovietstyle kolkhozes blast castroite firing squad demolished face torso juana six months pregnant started beating us twisted coils electric cable recalls former cuba political prisoner ezperanza pena exile today remember teresita ground lower ribs broken gladys arms broken doris face cut badly beatings tried drink water would pour lacerated cheeks mothers day allowed family visits recalls manuela calvo exile today mothers sons daughters watching beaten rubber hoses highpressure hoses turned us knocking us ground floor rolling us around guards laughed lovedones screamed helplessly female guards couldnt handle us male guards called brutal beatings saw teenaged girls beaten savagely bones broken mouths bleeding recalls polita grau thousands upon thousands cuban women also drowned died thirst eaten alive sharks attempting flee regime founded folks recently endorsed hillary clinton nation formerly richer half nations europe deluged immigrants remember donald trump taken greatly task media quickly repudiating david dukes socalled endorsement well certainly look media take hillary clinton similarly task instantly repudiating endorsement massjailing masstorturing massmurdering stalinists recalling sticks stones break bones riddle childhood david dukes crimes consist words hatespeech whereas literal sticks stonesand chains manacles bullwhips bulletsof fine folks enthusiastically endorsing hillary clinton caused untold suffering hundreds thousands people,1,Real

there have been various insider reports on the clinton foundation and the hillary email scandal on fox 
but the curious thing about this wall street journal report is that its clearly aimed at defending hillary clinton and smearing the fbi in the battle with obamas doj officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of hillary clinton 
which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility 
justice department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions 
following the february meeting officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said 
a stand down order much like the one in libya 
and remember mccabe whose wifes democratic political campaign received major cash from a clinton ally 
amid the internal fingerpointing on the clinton foundation matter some have blamed the fbis no  official deputy director andrew mccabe claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer his defenders deny that and say it was the justice department that kept pushing back on the investigation 
not a surprise either 
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
and thats what blew up when team hillary lashed out at the fbi it was a covert war between hillarys doj allies and the fbi coming out of the cold and they pushed so hard even mccabe was disgusted 
as a result of those complaints these people said a senior justice department official called the fbi deputy director mr mccabe on aug  to say the agents in new york seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions these people said the conversation was a tense one they said and at one point mr mccabe asked are you telling me that i need to shut down a validly predicated investigation the senior justice department official replied of course not

its hillarys hourthe only hope of defeating donald trump is hillary clintonthe difference between the two candidates is vast barack obama did not exaggerate when he claimed that she was better prepared to be a us president than even he wasor was her husband bill clinton stalinist cubas kgbfounded and mentored media organ cubadebate oct   
there was a day when winning a ringing endorsement from communist massmurdering terror sponsors who craved and came within a whisker of nuking your nation would not be considered an asset for a us presidential candidate 
 in any nation of the worldand even in the us during normal timesdonald trump would find himself either in prison or in a mental institution 
there was a day when being threatened with prison and torture even figuratively by an enemy stalinist regime that jailed and tortured political prisoners many of them us citizens at a higher rate than stalin during the great terror would be considered an enormous asset for a us presidential candidate 
but the ringing communist endorsement for hillary clinton gets even better 
 hillary clinton is our only hope of detaining barbarism 
so warns the eunuch scribe for a totalitarian regime that murdered more cubans in its first three years in power than hitler murdered germans during his first six and in the process converted a highlycivilized immigrantswamped nation into a slumsewer with the hemispheres highest suicide rate which is ravaged by tropical diseases where tens of thousands have died trying to escape where alley cats constitute a delicacy and where oxcarts represent luxury transportation 
on a few occasions trump has even suggested the assassination of hillary clinton 
so warn the notorious assassins of suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging from camilo cienfuegos to tony de la guardia to manuel barbarroja pineiro yes the castro regime devoured its own children even more voraciously than even lenin and stalins 
the news are dominated by revelationssome on videoshowing trumps obscenity and male chauvinist conductalong with his treatment of women as sex objects 
so warns the stalinist regime that jailed and tortured  cuban women for political crimes a totalitarian horror utterly unknown in the western hemisphere until the castro brothers and che guevara took power some of these cuban ladies suffered twice as long in castros gulag as alexander solzhenitsyn suffered in stalins 
their prison conditions were described by former political prisoner maritza lugo the punishment cells measure  feet wide by  feet long the toilet consists of an  inch hole in the ground through which cockroaches and rats enter especially in cool temperatures the rat come inside to seek the warmth of our bodies and we were often bitten the suicide rate among women prisoners was very high 
on christmas eve of  a cuban woman named juana diaz figueroa spat in the face of the executioners who were binding and gagging her castro and che guevaras kgbtrained secret police had found her guilty of feeding and hiding bandits cuban rednecks who took up arms to fight the stalinist theft of their land to build sovietstyle kolkhozes when the blast from castroite firing squad demolished her face and torso juana was six months pregnant 
they started by beating us with twisted coils of electric cable recalls former cuba political prisoner ezperanza pena from exile today i remember teresita on the ground with all her lower ribs broken gladys had both her arms broken doris had her face cut up so badly from the beatings that when she tried to drink water would pour out of her lacerated cheeks 
on mothers day they allowed family visits recalls manuela calvo from exile today but as our mothers and sons and daughters were watching we were beaten with rubber hoses and highpressure hoses were turned on us knocking all of us the ground floor and rolling us around as the guards laughed and our lovedones screamed helplessly 
when female guards couldnt handle us male guards were called in for more brutal beatings i saw teenaged girls beaten savagely their bones broken their mouths bleeding  recalls polita grau 
thousands upon thousands of cuban women have also drowned died of thirst or have been eaten alive by sharks attempting to flee the regime founded by the folks who recently endorsed hillary clinton this from a nation formerly richer than half the nations of europe and deluged by immigrants from same 
remember how donald trump was taken greatly to task by the media for not quickly repudiating david dukes socalled endorsement 
well we certainly look for the media to take hillary clinton similarly to task for not instantly repudiating the endorsement of massjailing masstorturing massmurdering stalinists

lets look at the power of the rich with all the money that gates bezos and other superrich people have what can they force you or me to do can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot can they force us to pay money into the governmentrun  and doomed  obamacare program can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity can they force us to buy our sugar from a highcost domestic producer rather than from a lowcost caribbean producer the answer to all of these questions is a big fat no 
you say williams i dont understand let me be more explicit bill gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity he has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off rich people have little power to force us to do anything a lowly municipal clerk earning  a year has far more lifeanddeath power over us it is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house ply a trade open a restaurant and do myriad other activities its government people not rich people who have the power to coerce us and rip us off they have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey this coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption

so heres the ultimate question if some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us whos to blame i think its we the people who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town  and thats most of them but that might be deceitful of us for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hill1.png?itok=2WFcOaHn,hate,hillarys castro endorsement,nigerian novelist wonders everyone loves hillary november daniel greenfield everyone love hillary clinton hard say unfavorable ratings hit makes popular bubonic plague obamacare osama bin ladens corpse much go atlantic decided run piece chimamanda adichie titledwhy hillary clinton widely loved response seeing name chimamanda adichie probably huh unless youre gender studies student ivy case know exactly love chimamanda adichie nigerian novelist whose feminists big circles clinton campaign unbearably awkward panegyric adichie obvious attempt channel canned obama poetry like hillary branding fails badly howlers like millions admire tapestry hillary clintons past people hillary clinton becomes first woman president united states weep joy quite hymn comrade stalin getting means except tow truck theres phrasing oh phrasing hillary clinton guilty immediately stepped view american public first lady arkansas awkward attempt channel obama poetry instead reads like dvd manual badly translated japanese atlantic piece full lines straddle border tineared propagandistic cliche bad writing lawyer full dreams guilty traditional first lady offended old patriarchal order theres theme article deny reality conservative writer labeled congenital liar first lady label stuck repeated overand convenient label harness misogyny liar hostility engendered could possibly first lady refused still silent liar reemerged election even though politifact respected source information politicians certified honest politicians perfect timing defense would right hillary clinton shouted rally new york dont worry hillary honest politicians site supporting said words repeated context begun breathe thrum life especially emails press coverage emails become unclear morass emails must mean something terrible often invoked classified emails illegal server violation regulations dealing handling classified material thats got lots context coverup people love hillary clinton know system state department old stodgy nothing like blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton used blackberry wanted keep using became secretary state people love hillary know love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry lawyer full dreams fights children migrant workers loves smooth whirl politifact thrums life says blackberry honest iphone hillary many dreams thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly offend traditional stodgy patriarchal order system american conservative media saw opportunity blow emails story proportion soon followed almost bashfully rest american media works nigeria thats works america objective basis equate hillary clinton opponent theyre mammals need oxygen live theyre better writers chimamanda adichie people love hillary clinton see failings general american media news entertains rather informs bristle benign stories covered ominous tone bristle hug blackberry weep fear patriarchal stodgy systems prevent hillary thrumming first lady north america know bit careful understand cannot afford spontaneity would think six figure speeches could afford little actions falsely magnified leaned caution wrapped kind caution sometimes makes appear stilted wrapped caution whirling blackberry one hand bristled public retracting quills occasionally hissing informed fashion children migrant workers admired tapestry past millions americans selfindulgent expectation politician perfect frustrated hillary clinton allowed complexity get beyonce phone think adichie got another hit,1,Real

if david frum had suggested that hillary clinton used to play for the patriots i would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot 
but she is a patriot she will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the united states she will defend allies she will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality she may bend some rules for her own and her supporters advantage she will not outright defy legality altogether above all she can govern herself the first indispensable qualification for governing others 
this is under an atlantic piece headlined the conservative case for hillary which also contends why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions dont do it for herdo it for the republic and the constitution 
the trouble with this line of argument is that hillarys own agenda includes a rejection of the first and second amendment its a rather unusual way to support the constitution by destroying it

Humberto Fontova,2016-11-03T11:05:00.000+02:00,hillarys castro endorsement,"nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary november   daniel greenfield 
why does everyone love hillary clinton its hard to say her unfavorable ratings have hit  that makes her more popular than 
 the bubonic plague 
 obamacare 
 osama bin ladens corpse 
its not much to go on but the atlantic decided to run a piece by chimamanda adichie titledwhy is hillary clinton so widely loved 
your response to seeing the name chimamanda adichie was probably huh unless youre a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her chimamanda adichie is a nigerian novelist whose we should all be feminists is big in those circles 
the clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned obama poetry and like most hillary branding it fails badly 
there are howlers like there are millions who admire the tapestry of hillary clintons past and there are people who when hillary clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the united states will weep from joy its not quite a hymn to comrade stalin nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck 
and then theres the phrasing oh the phrasing hillary clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the american public as the first lady of arkansas 
this is an awkward attempt to channel that obama poetry but instead it reads like a dvd manual badly translated from the japanese 
the atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tineared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing 
she was a lawyer full of dreams 
she was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal order 
then theres the theme of the article which is to just deny reality 
a conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady and the label stuck because it was repeated over and overand it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a liar then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has reemerged during this election even though politifact a respected source of information about politicians has certified that she is more honest than most politicians 
the perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after hillary clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in new york on  but dont worry hillary is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so 
 other words have been repeated over and over with no context until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something terrible if only because of how often it is invoked 
how about classified emails or illegal server or violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material thats got lots of context or coverup 
the people who love hillary clinton know that the it system at the state department is old and stodgy nothing like a blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton was used to her blackberry and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state 
people who love hillary know that she love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl politifact thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the iphone hillary has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system 
the american conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of proportion soon followed almost bashfully by the rest of the american media 
is that how it works in nigeria because thats not how it works in america 
there is no objective basis on which to equate hillary clinton to her opponent 
theyre both mammals they need oxygen to live theyre better writers than chimamanda adichie 
the people who love hillary clinton see the failings of the general american media where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone 
they bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent hillary from being the thrumming first lady of north america 
they know that she is a bit too careful but they understand that she has to be that she cannot afford spontaneity 
you would think with all those six figure speeches she could afford a little 
her actions so falsely magnified that she leaned into caution wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted

Walter Williams,2016-11-03T11:03:00.000+02:00,the rich and us,"daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
in the final stretch of the election hillary rodham clinton has gone to war with the fbi 
the word unprecedented has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired but its still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi 
but thats exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillarys opponent in this election 
the fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillarys people have circulated a letter attacking comey there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump it wouldnt be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi 
the fbis leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary and the fbis credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton 
the covert struggle between fbi agents and obamas doj people has gone explosively public 
the new york times has compared comey to j edgar hoover its bizarre headline james comey role recalls hoovers fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published a column calling for comeys resignation not to be outdone time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women 
james carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch 
countless media stories charge comey with violating procedure do you know whats a procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server 
senator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever 
if james comey is really out to hurt hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it 
not too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiners computer 
either comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs 
the only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a  unfavorable rating 
and its an interesting question 
hillarys old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that it was a security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi 
pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb 
there are two possible explanations 
hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign 
but the other explanation is that her people panicked 
going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign its an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi thats not hubris its fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her 
during the original fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi 
theres only one reason for such bizarre behavior 
the clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival and so its gone all in on fighting the fbi its an unprecedented step born of fear its hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot 
clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid 
you can smell the fear 
the fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation its finding new emails all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isnt how you react to smoke its how you respond to a fire 
the misguided assault on the fbi tells us that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup was a preemptive cover up the clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed 
the clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near it 
the campaign against comey is pure intimidation its also a warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand 
hillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but shes never shown fear or desperation before now that has changed whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else has",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hillary-clinton-seddique-mateen.png?itok=LRGe4TyC,hate,nigerian novelist

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-04T01:47:41.238+02:00,david frum hillary is a patriot who will protect the constitution,"european media jihad against geert wilders as they lose their grip the political and media elites are getting desperate november   robert spencer 
the mainstream media in western europe and north america isnt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore instead journalists are working openly to quell what looks increasingly on both sides of the atlantic like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the selfappointed political and media aristocracy that seems hellbent on driving western civilization over the cliff and so its time for another round of their twominutes hate against dutch politician and freedom fighter geert wilders 
wilders has yet again gone on trial in the netherlands for hate speech and this time the case against him is especially flimsy as europe is roiled by the criminal activity of muslim migrants he is being accused of hate speech for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from morocco from which most of the muslim migrants in the netherlands come has to be stopped 
this trial could very easily backfire on the dutch inquisitors and make wilders more popular than ever with the people of the netherlands and europe in general as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites forcing them to accept a massive influx of muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife bloodshed and sharia oppression 
consequently those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position wilders chanted no more moroccans at a rally the horror to any sane person this means stop the influx of moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls to the media which at this point is quite insane insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality this means genocide 
and so in this deutsche welle dw piece by freelance journalist teri schultz were told that european parliament lawmaker cecile kyenge who was born in congo had numerous racial slurs  not to mention bananas literally  thrown at her along with suggestions she go back to her country does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for wilders position of course not but wilders schultz tells us is of course farright that allpurpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to rightthinking deutsche welle readers that wilders is as far as the media elites are concerned unsavory and must be opposed and shunned his positions left unexamined 
schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece being sure to tell her hapless readers that i am known for extreme antiislam views to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right the term extreme also since the western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as extremists also implies that i am a terrorist 
after the article came out i challenged schultz on this she replied i dont think even you would consider your views mainstream do you i responded absolutely yes my views were the broad mainstream in the western world from  ad until the s what changed not islamic teaching to that she said okay youd have to argue it with another expert which i am not but thanks again for contributing indeed she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold 
in any case schultzs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the selfappointed opinionshapers they can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of europe and north america farright and extreme every day and they do but the public can see with their eyes what is happening wilders popularity isnt growing because he is a charming fellow which is of course not to say that he isnt its growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure 
and its only going to get worse for them the brexit vote and the trump candidacy whether he wins or loses shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged those challenges will continue and grow they will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hellary_2.png?itok=-ccP3jWx,hate,smell hillarys fear,president hillary clinton share stubborn desire avoid scrutiny november lloyd billingsley president united states powerful man world working three shifts designated successor former first lady secretary state hillary clinton fbi continues investigations clinton emails continue emerge worth recalling mysteries presidents narrative last year obamas narrator new york times called david axelrod released massive believer forty years politics author recalls perfectly timed unexpected call would change life david barack said voice phone im thinking want next wondering could talk call took place explains perfect timing february presidents maternal grandfather stanley dunham passed away gramps narrator called longer around offer insights family history correct accounts might appear write one dreams father gramps might say kenyan foreign student looks lot like nat king cole actually gramps might kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance cole passed away enjoyed revival daughter natalies unforgettable album narrator dreams father invokes stubborn desire protect scrutiny doesnt fault people suspicions fail take face value elusive father prop someone elses narrative image could alter whim ignore convenient narrative myth tale useful fiction dreams father photo section index key characters get first name include frank gets words back president identified person frank marshall davis stalinist paul kengor regards presidents mentor explained communist untold story frank marshall davis dreams real father documentarian joel gilbert made case davis presidents biological father malik obama son kenyan barack h obama sees strong physical resemblance also holds true policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities writings davis policies president barack obama kenyan barack obama though man left prosoviet communist prosoviet would attended patrice lumumba university moscow indeed obama warned fellow kenyans soviet meddling africa kenyan obama would found strange presidents cancelation missile defense european allies outspoken man would supported kind hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described stonewalled fight truth forces obstruction intimidation harassment obamas washington kenyan barack h obama issues strongman types jomo kenyatta ruled kenya death keeping country africa kenyan barack obama record supporter homosexual causes frank marshall davis hand certainly board davis wrote memoir livin blues dramatic civil rights demonstrations often thought ought form united front joint sitins cafes mind envisioned result indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning police get hurry got niggers counters washrooms loaded fairies lesbians perhaps might joint march washington waving banners blacks homos arise davis pornographic novel sex rebel black might explain presidents stubborn desire protect scrutiny could also something narrator calls less flattering aspects fathers character dreams father kenyan raised muslim audacity hope confirmed atheist thinking religion much superstition like mumbojumbo witch doctors witnessed kenyan villages youth audacity narrator explains went predominantly muslim school indonesia indicate whether atheists lutherans jews buddhists also attended school registration records supposedly destroyed flooding predominantly muslim school also emerges believer axelrod indicate students faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham even kenyan barack obama missing account proves enlightening ways brian williams msnbc asked presidential candidates steps would take event simultaneous terror attack major american cities axelrod explains obama neglected include would pursue perpetrators hillary clinton likewise passing privately regarded terrorist attack us compound benghazi spontaneous protest video like president clinton always shown stubborn desire protect scrutiny bleachbit hammers lies hillary handlers best make emails disappear contents remain something mystery mysteries linger president background hand things perfectly clear potus former flotus decline identify islamic terrorism shrinkwrapped statist superstition lie greatest ease counts like critters orwells animal farm one find impossible say back july party faithful chanting four years presidents speech democratic national convention,1,Real
Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-04T02:09:39.970+02:00,nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary,"obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel in his twilight months in office obama seeks to undermine americas closest ally november   ari lieberman 
israelis and the proisrael community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when obama leaves office during obamas tenure relations with israel were caustic at best barely five months after taking office he publicly launched a scathing attack against israel  where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between israeli and palestinian actions  and did so in one of the most virulently antisemitic countries on the planet he later skipped over israel despite the fact that israel was a mere minute plane ride away that was obamas opening salvo against americas closest ally it was only downhill from there 
obama utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about israel to sympathetic members of the press in one such instance an administration official probably ben rhodes  referred to prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a  chickensht  in another instance obama voiced concurrence with french president nicholas sarkozy when sarkozy characterized netanyahu as a  liar  
often the obama administration would subject israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits israels defense minister moshe yaalon was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata in the most notorious incident obama left netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with michelle and his daughters one commentator dryly noted that obama treated netanyahu as though he was the president of equatorial guinea 
ultimately obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from democratic lawmakers and donors obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against israel never dissipated and relations with israels prime minister remained toxic 
tensions surfaced again during israels counter insurgency campaign against the gazabased terror group hamas obama held up a shipment of hellfire missiles to israel and then tried to strongarm israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by turkey and qatar two despotic nations that support hamas and gave aid and comfort to islamic state terrorists 
obama saw netanyahus opposition to the jcpoa the socalled iran deal as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations the socalled settlements were another point of contention obama disregarded a letter of assurance to israel provided by the bush administration specifying that in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of  
bush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of israel to build within those blocs it is also important to note that no new settlement was created during obamas term of office and netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories but nothing was ever enough for obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate israel at every turn his parting shot was at the united nations general assembly during a recent address to that contemptible body he explicitly singled out israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of indonesia obamas moral compass had gone completely awry 
despite the fact that obama is in his twilight months he can still inflict immeasurable harm on israel according to a report featured in the wall street journal  obama is contemplating several options each with significant negative implications for israel the report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after november  so as not to harm clintons presidential prospects 
he may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of israeli communities living in east jerusalem judea and samaria perhaps more ominously he may seek to impose dictates on israel utilizing the un security council 
in one such scenario obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring israeli communities situated in judea and samaria to be illegal alternatively the administration may seek formal recognition of the state of palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects israels existence as a jewish state lastly he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant israeli territorial concessions 
the united states does not have to actively support any unsc resolution to see the successful passage of antiisraeli measures it merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers france facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized muslim population has historically been the fiercest advocate for the palestinian arabs it is likely that the administration would seek to have the french submit a draft resolution and the united states would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted thus guaranteeing passage 
israel has few friends on the security council and american collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antisemitism would be an act of extreme betrayal it would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement 
but israel is not without recourse there is strong bipartisan support for israel in congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the white house their strong opposition to un involvement 
some like the jerusalem posts caroline glick have suggested that the israelis can reach out to the russians with carrots in an effort to counter obamas nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch moscow has always been in the pockets of the muslim bloc and its recent vote at unesco in support of a resolution denying the jewish nexus to jerusalem serves to reinforce this view moreover even if russia can be persuaded relying on putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the mafia and would come with a steep price 
it is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration  spiraling healthcare costs racial discord cyber breaches russias seizure of crimea and eastern ukraine isis the meltdown in the arab world iranian terrorism chinas expansion into the south and east china seas the migrant crisis immigration reform  obama would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the mideasts only democracy and americas staunchest ally that fact in it of itself speaks volumes about the man",english,frontpagemag.com,http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg,hate,european media jihad geert wilders,time magazines joe klein wrong hillary clinton rebutting absurd claims namesake november joseph klein time magazines joe klein penned article entitled hillary clinton choice keep america great feel duty bound respond least absurd comments made namesake author primary colors novel based bill clintons first presidential campaign joe klein laments hillary severely damaged course year battering shes received hands extremists media sorry hillarys wounds selfinflicted lies greed corruption go back decades reached crescendo dual scandals use private server state department business secretary state payforplay clinton foundation one part trump indisputably real ego joe klein wrote hillary epitome humility grace would put clintons failings league trumps depravities delusional declared klein agree statement precisely opposite reason advances trump abuse public office personal gain hand pick hillarys word ambassador serve one dangerous countries world never respond multiple requests enhanced security let alone pick phone contact ambassador chris stevens directly government able save four lives keep four lives safe keep country safe asked stevens former fiancé rhetorical question hillary would unable answer trump lie families slain benghazi hillary trump put national security risk using private server government emails order evade freedom information act hillary short anyone thinks hillarys proven record recklessness mendacity indifference troubling several orders magnitude trumps depravities delusional joe klein complains trump deals stereotypes blacks hispanics muslims women yes even veterans yet much hillarys pitch genderbased elect woman attacks millions people support opponent vile epithets deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic good measure irredeemable joe klein charges trump gone wrong society nothing gone right paraphrase bill clinton would depend definitions wrong right hillary clinton really right parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks characterized white privilege systemic racism country right leaps conclusions police brutality aimed africanamericans evidence specific cases carefully examined dont think hillary also represents political correctness antireligious bigotry secular left elite many americans believe truly gone wrong society women world summit last year example hillary said order fully secure reproductive rights women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs structural biases changed hillary demeaned sincerely held religious belief sanctity life held millions americans reminiscent president obamas contemptuous clinging religion quote back hillarys key supporters top aides targeted catholic church particular notion progressive reform needs catholic spring catholics demand end middle ages dictatorship beginning little democracy respect gender equality catholic church wrote sandy newman president voices progress email clintons campaign chairman john podesta response podesta picked spring theme wrote created catholics alliance common good organize moment like think lacks leadership likewise catholics united like spring movements think one bottom time magazines joe klein talks right wrong american society get washington dc bubble often actually speak american people daytoday concerns even hillary clinton ends winning election country remain divided mandate whatsoever advance progressive agenda,1,Real
EdJenner,2016-11-04T07:17:16.422+02:00,you can smell hillarys fear,"the president and hillary clinton share a stubborn desire to avoid scrutiny november   lloyd billingsley 
the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world is working three shifts for his designated successor former first lady and secretary of state hillary clinton as the fbi continues its investigations and clinton emails continue to emerge it is worth recalling the mysteries in the presidents narrative 
last year obamas narrator as the new york times called david axelrod released his massive believer  my forty years in politics  the author recalls a perfectly timed and unexpected call that would change his life 
david its barack said the voice on the phone im thinking about what i want to do next and was wondering if we could talk this call took place in  which explains the perfect timing 
on february   the presidents maternal grandfather stanley dunham passed away at  so gramps as the narrator called him was no longer around to offer insights on family history correct any accounts that might appear or write one of his own 
in the  dreams from my father gramps might say that a kenyan foreign student looks a lot like nat king cole actually gramps might not the kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance to cole who passed away in  but enjoyed a revival in the s through daughter natalies unforgettable album 
the narrator of dreams from my father invokes a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny and he doesnt fault people their suspicions if they fail to take him at face value his elusive father is a prop in someone elses narrative and an image i could alter on a whim or ignore when convenient the narrative itself is a myth a tale and a useful fiction 
dreams from my father has no photo section no index and key characters get only a first name these include frank who gets  words back in  the president himself identified this person as frank marshall davis the stalinist paul kengor regards as the presidents mentor as he explained in the communist the untold story of frank marshall davis  
in dreams from my real father  documentarian joel gilbert made a case that davis is the presidents biological father malik obama son of the kenyan barack h obama sees a strong physical resemblance  that also holds true on the policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities between the writings of davis and the policies of president barack obama 
the kenyan barack obama though a man of the left was not a prosoviet communist had he been prosoviet he would have attended patrice lumumba university in moscow indeed obama warned his fellow kenyans about soviet meddling in africa 
the kenyan obama would have found strange the presidents  cancelation of missile defense for european allies an outspoken man he would not have supported the kind of hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described in stonewalled my fight for truth against the forces of obstruction intimidation and harassment in obamas washington  
the kenyan barack h obama had issues with strongman types such as jomo kenyatta who ruled kenya from  until his death in  in keeping with his country and most of africa the kenyan barack obama is not on record as a supporter of homosexual causes frank marshall davis on the other hand was certainly on board as davis wrote in his  memoir livin the blues  
during the dramatic civil rights demonstrations of the s i often thought we ought to form a united front with joint sitins at cafes in my mind i envisioned the result an indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning the police get here in a hurry we got niggers at our counters and our washrooms are loaded with fairies and lesbians or perhaps there might have been a joint march on washington waving banners blacks and homos arise 
that and davis pornographic novel sex rebel black  might explain the presidents stubborn desire to protect himself from scrutiny it could also have something do with what the narrator calls the less flattering aspects of my fathers character 
in dreams from my father  the kenyan is raised a muslim but in the audacity of hope he is a confirmed atheist thinking religion to be so much superstition like the mumbojumbo of witch doctors that he had witnessed in the kenyan villages of his youth 
in audacity  the narrator explains that he went to a predominantly muslim school in indonesia he does not indicate whether atheists lutherans jews or buddhists also attended the school registration records were supposedly destroyed by flooding 
the predominantly muslim school also emerges in believer  but axelrod does not indicate if students of other faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham and even the kenyan barack obama are missing from this account but it proves enlightening in other ways 
in a  brian williams of msnbc asked presidential candidates what steps they would take in the event of a simultaneous terror attack on major american cities as axelrod explains obama neglected to include that he would pursue the perpetrators 
hillary clinton did likewise in  passing off what she privately regarded as a terrorist attack on the us compound in benghazi as a spontaneous protest over a video like the president clinton has always shown a stubborn desire to protect herself from scrutiny with bleachbit  hammers and lies hillary and her handlers did their best to make more than  emails disappear 
the contents remain something of a mystery just as mysteries linger about the president and his background on the other hand by now some things are perfectly clear 
the potus and former flotus both decline to identify islamic terrorism both are shrinkwrapped in statist superstition and both lie with the greatest of ease on these counts like the critters in orwells animal farm one can find it impossible to say which was which

Robert Spencer,2016-11-04T11:07:00.000+02:00,european media jihad against geert wilders,"why time magazines joe klein is so wrong about hillary clinton rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake november   joseph klein 
time magazines joe klein has just penned an article entitled why hillary clinton is the only choice to keep america great i feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of primary colors the novel based on about bill clintons first presidential campaign in  
the other joe klein laments that hillary has been so severely damaged in the course of the year battering shes received at the hands of extremists and the media sorry but hillarys wounds are selfinflicted her lies greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for state department business while she was secretary of state and of the payforplay clinton foundation 
there is one part of trump that is indisputably real his ego the other joe klein wrote as if hillary were the epitome of humility and grace 
those who would put clintons failings in the same league as trumps depravities are delusional declared klein i agree with his statement but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain he did not hand pick hillarys word an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security let alone pick up the phone and contact ambassador chris stevens directly the government was not able to save four lives to keep four lives safe how can you keep a country safe asked stevens former fiancé in a rhetorical question that hillary would be unable to answer trump did not lie to the families of those slain in benghazi as hillary did trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government emails in order to evade the freedom of information act as hillary did 
in short anyone who thinks that hillarys proven record of recklessness mendacity and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than trumps depravities is delusional 
the other joe klein complains that trump deals in stereotypes  the blacks the hispanics the muslims the women and yes even the veterans yet much of hillarys pitch is genderbased elect her because she is a woman and she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets  deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic and  for good measure  irredeemable 
the other joe klein charges that trump is about all that has gone wrong in our society and nothing of what has gone right to paraphrase bill clinton that would depend on what your definitions of wrong and right are is hillary clinton really right when she parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white privilege and systemic racism in this country is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police brutality aimed against africanamericans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined i dont think so 
hillary also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society at the women in the world summit last year for example hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of americans reminiscent of president obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in  
hillarys key supporters and top aides have targeted the catholic church in particular for their notion of progressive reform there needs to be a catholic spring in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church wrote sandy newman president of voices for progress in an email to clintons campaign chairman john podesta in response podesta picked up on the spring theme he wrote we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now likewise catholics united like most spring movements i think this one will have to be bottom up 
when time magazines joe klein talks about what is right or wrong in american society he should get out of his washington dc bubble more often and actually speak with the american people about their daytoday concerns even if hillary clinton ends up winning the election the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/obama-wc2.jpg?itok=Pm_S0dQe,hate,potus flotus pocus,potentially worst vp american history look tim kaines track record agendas november discover networks years student harvard law school early tim kaine took year legal studies order work jesuit missionaries honduras nine months spent kaine developed keen interest teachings local priests adherents liberation theology essentially marxism dressed christianity kaine embraced liberation theology later claimed changed deepened completing legal education kaine joined civil litigation firm practiced law years also launched career local politics mids eventually went serve governor virginia us senator present past july hillary clinton named kaine vice presidential running mate course political career kaine developed noteworthy ties number islamist individuals organizations role virginias governor kaine appointed esam omeish president muslim brotherhood affiliated muslim american society mas virginias immigration commission omeish previously served president national muslim students association board member islamic society north america deep ties brotherhood omeish also board chairman islamic center passaic county new jersey mosque significant terrorist connections vice president board member dar alhijrah islamic center virginia mosque whose imams included among others alqaeda operative supporter suicide bombings prior appointment kaine omeish described muslim brotherhood moderate organization praised former hamas leader ahmed yassin beloved sheikh pledged lend assistance palestinians understood jihad way way liberate land may kaine keynote speaker muslim american society freedom foundations standing justice dinner kaine agreed attend dar alhijrah islamic centers annual fundraising banquet september kaine spoke event presented lifetime achievement award us muslim brotherhood leader jamal barzinji closely associated palestinian islamic jihad hamas extremist international institute islamic thought iiit kaines us senate campaign received officials islamic society north america council americanislamic relations plus another iiits presidentoffinance hisham altalib early kaine objected strenuously republican house speaker john boehner invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu speak us congress gravity growing iranian nuclear threat netanyahus profound disagreement negotiated deal obama administration pursuing iran kaine joined seven senate democrats boycotting netanyahus speech summer kaine declared strong supporter final agreement allowed islamist regime tehran enrich uranium build advanced centrifuges purchase ballistic missiles fund terrorism guaranteed nearzero breakout time development nuclear bomb approximately decade road may kaine one fourteen us senators wrote letter president barack obama urging allow people wartorn terrorismravaged syria united states refugees despite many peoples concern terrorists could potentially infiltrate refugee program later year kaine opposed bill passed house representatives would required careful vetting syrians iraqis could admitted united states refugees refugees people terrorized terrorists kaine said november interview wherein claimed refugee vetting process one safest areas speech senate floor following month kaine said look refugee crisis test whether like biblical job true principles whether well abandon also urged fellow legislators emulate example thcentury indians near jamestown island helped starving english settlers survive offering extension hand strangers strange land kaine ranks among leftwing political figures united states today person lifetime rating american conservative union graded members congress voting records year since similarly conservativereviewcom gives kaine rating short tim kaine essentially political mirror image hillary clinton mrs clinton picked running mate saw someone could effectively help implement radical leftist agenda,1,Real
Ari Lieberman,2016-11-04T11:06:00.000+02:00,obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel,"the unraveling of hillarys corrupt sphere of influence november   michael cutler 
the  elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director james comey on friday october   as reported by nbc news on october  th   fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in clinton probe  as reid accuses comey of hatch act violation  once again the clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional indeed tom clancy could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues 
while comeys recent remarks regarding the clinton investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how hillarys use of a private computer server private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception 
the current focus of the clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information if that laptop had been hacked both weiner and abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail this was an issue raised by congressman louie gohmert texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october   in a segment that was posted under the title  rep gohmert clinton is a potential victim of blackmail  
additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well a chain is as strong as its weakest link the weak links begin with hillary clinton and huma abedin and may now include anthony weiner and perhaps others meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that wikileaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the clintons or their foundation 
could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well 
lets take a moment to understand how all of this began 
just months earlier hillary clinton had been let off the hook by an fbi director who in his official statement on july    included this excerpt to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but that is not what we are deciding now 
by comeys own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why comey did not see fit to take comparable action with ms clinton 
comeys ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security 
however perhaps comeys hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference on june   abc news reported  us attorney general loretta lynch bill clinton meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report  
that article served as a predication for my article  loretta lynchs private meeting with bill clinton prior to release of benghazi report  why would the attorney general who sets the tone for law enforcement do this 
as attorney general lynch is fbi director comeys boss 
at the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating hillarys illegal use of a private email server nonsecure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the clinton foundation 
in fact on october   breitbart reported  clinton foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director  therefore bill clinton was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren 
however just days after that meeting news organizations reported that hillary was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election 
on july   newsmax reported  ny times clinton weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins  hillarys statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to go along to get along 
indeed lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary  loretta lynch same as the old boss  the attorney general nominees disturbing views on us immigration law 
my article included an excerpt from a yahooap news report attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us pressed by sen jeff sessions of alabama a leading immigration hardliner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned however when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job lynch replied the right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response under later questioning by democratic sen chuck schumer of new york lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status 
this was disturbing and telling clearly ms lynchs views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals 
as attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department ms lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective 
however lynch and the others who have fallen under hillary clintons corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in hillarys web of deception having fallen victim to the hillary virus throughout clintons many decades in american politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable it is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/oc.jpg?itok=bdEqmsW_,hate,time magazines joe klein wrong hillary clinton,nbcs baghdad bob fbi investigation hillary november daniel greenfield remember hillary clinton insisting fbi investigation security review even fbi rejected claim well andrea mitchell nbcs baghdad bob isnt giving claim easily even rest clinton clique screeching fbi investigating hillary like bats nether regions leftwing hell mitchell sticking old spin fbi investigation hillary close eyes say three times fbi investigating hillary complete state denial thursday msnbc host andrea mitchell interrupted live coverage donald trump speaking florida campaign rally supposedly factcheck candidate citing bombshell report fbi conducting extensive investigation hillary clintons email charitable foundation scandals mitchell refused accept reality lot factchecking shes criminal investigation fact investigation review emails lie fbi according james comey grounds prosecute lies theres criminality fretted dont know even startbut mean put context context defending hillary clinton become mental illness wrote earlier week fact checking become media term insisting primacy alternate reality even flies face actual reality fbi investigation hillary anyone believes probably sort rightwinger listens fbi actually says rather nbc says fbi says,1,Real

remember when hillary clinton was insisting that there was no fbi investigation of her just a security review even when the fbi rejected that claim 
well andrea mitchell nbcs own baghdad bob isnt giving up that claim so easily even while the rest of the clinton clique is screeching against the fbi for investigating hillary like bats from the nether regions of leftwing hell mitchell is sticking to the old spin there is no fbi investigation of hillary  close your eyes and say it three times the fbi is not investigating hillary its not its not 
in a complete state of denial on thursday msnbc host andrea mitchell interrupted live coverage of donald trump speaking at a florida campaign rally to supposedly factcheck the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the fbi was conducting an extensive investigation into hillary clintons email and charitable foundation scandals 
mitchell refused to accept reality just a lot of factchecking to do shes not under criminal investigation in fact its not an investigation its just a review of the emails she did not lie to the fbi according to james comey there was no grounds to prosecute her so there are no lies theres no criminality she fretted i dont know even where to startbut i mean we have to put it in some context 
the context is that defending hillary clinton has become a mental illness 
but as i wrote earlier this week fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality there is no fbi investigation of hillary anyone who believes that is probably some sort of rightwinger who listens to what the fbi actually says rather than what nbc says that the fbi says",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/clinton.jpg?itok=K1u2ESTl,hate,potentially worst vp american history,obama pardon hillary every conceivable crime november dont look pardonher talk growing clinton campaign media allies rage fbi looking pardon solution way spin pardon something straight admission guilt political reconciliation way defy mean republicans take issue crimes hillary committed table go take much clairvoyance predict clintons strident opponents may seek extend use criminal investigations political tactic undermine presidency wins election next week prospect triggers startling idea president barack obamasimply pardon clinton wins election presidential pardon could short circuit maneuvering constitution gives president power grant reprieves pardons offenses united states could used public aware allegations clinton yet continued lead election polls voters choose presidency decision allegations disqualifying deserves respect presidential pardon could ratify assessment yes obama pardon hillary clinton corruption bribery abuse classified information everything lets print list every possible crime pardon hillary would save time energy raise hillary law would clear statement could get away murder literally,1,Real

the official media narrative is that muslims are the worlds greatest victims the truth especially in majority muslim countries is rather strikingly different  
crowds of muslims attacked hindu homes and temples in eastern bangladesh this week raising concerns that the authorities are not taking steps to curb rising religious tensions 
attacks on hindus are not unusual in bangladesh but it is rare to see multiple crowds targeting temples in an organized way as they did on sunday and monday 
note the casual language of the times muslim religious violence is commonplace in bangladesh its just not common for it to be happening on this scale 
but how could it be otherwise islam is structurally xenophobic violently bigoted and racist down to its origins islams faith is expressed in a violent campaign against nonmuslims this is jihad 
muslims attacking hindus christians jews yazidis or any other group that just means it must be wednesday or any other day of the week 
on sunday hundreds of muslims entered a hindu neighborhood where they ransacked  temples and the homes of more than  families mr deb said he said that the mob used long hard sticks and locally made sharp weapons to assault hindus they found there and that at least  people including a priest were wounded

bovendien 
former defense minister of canada paul hellyer has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement with this convention which comes out of the hat of the international bankers  families will obtain control over almost the entire world constitutions of member countries will no longer apply only the will of the  families the elite will apply 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october  of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels  the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forumprotected by the division of powers under the constitution act  
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law  the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms  and overrides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health education social services and public utilitiesincluding the elimination of subsidies monopolies and state enterprises for public welfare in short the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional builtrights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health education social services and public funds including the termination of subsidies  monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest in short the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants 
but this is not all paul hellyer which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world the international bankers international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only  families 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers yet not so long ago until  the canadian government expressed its money itself there was no such thing as inflation poverty and debt canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time life was good cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do from one day to the issued money creation in  the central banks and money was no longer free within a few years canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education health housing etc can be paid without causing debts paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version he lets no grass grow does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this 
dear readers this could be the big break this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers the same applies we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it we want a better and fairer world then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T09:20:32.054+03:00,they knew the end of the clinton lies begins,our new country women and minorities hit hardest the rape culture the media wont cover october   ann coulter every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the democrats coincidentally the democrats have brought in another  to  million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole  our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july    two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online uk july   needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal alien gang rape at all by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape  why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam  reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe thats hillarys dream if she wins joe sobrans parody of the typical new york times headline about anything

other drawings repeated the world view that all of israel is palestine showing the pa map of palestine which completely erases the existence of israel and its legitimacy see below this message is repeated endlessly by the pa and fatah children are told that  it will all return to us  on kids tv programs the pa national security forces regularly post photos from all over israel presenting the places as palestine and even crossword puzzles portray israeli cities as occupied palestine 
the pas exploitation of palestinian childrens innocence is precisely what pmw has been highlighting and warning about for years the pa and fatah repeatedly demonize israel as a monster whose only intention is to harm palestinians israel is  satan with a tail  on pa tv childrens programs and  satans project  fighting allahs project in sermons delivered by mahmoud abbas advisor similarly palestinian terrorist murderers are being portrayed as innocent victims of alleged israeli  executions  a few of the drawings included doves some calling for peace and freedom a major focus of palestinian authority policy today is to demand freedom for all imprisoned palestinian terrorists including murderers one drawing specifies freedom for ahmad manasrah  a child terrorist who stabbed and critically wounded two israelis one of them a yearold boy",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/msc-house-bills-sidelined-bbf-1-web.jpg?itok=KzadV_TO,hate,new country women minorities hit hardest,hillary clinton tops islamist money politics list dubious awards dont want win one top recipients islamic money politics certainly tops list hillary clinton likes complain dark money dark money gets middle east forums research shows hillary clinton tops list raking prominent islamists includes senior officials council americanislamic relations cair declared terrorist organization united arab emirates november example mrs clinton accepted former cair vicechairman ahmad alakhras defended numerous islamists ohio indicted later convicted terrorism charges among current presidential candidates jill stein accepted donald trump gary johnson received islamist money top recent recipients money enemy include rep keith ellison rep andre carson top ten list includes nine democrats one independent sen bernie sanders accepted republicans dont think thats surprising anyone though feel sorry jill stein hates israel announced wouldnt killed osama bin laden whats girl gotta get ahead jihad street anyway,1,Real

in the candidates for top jobs i excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian in the last list of outside boardscommissions most who are listed appear to be muslim american except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian

Dr. Majid Rafizadeh,2016-10-27T09:20:34.163+03:00,weird bans on women in iran,"bill clinton inc billions for the foundation  million for the clintons october   
call it the unintended revenge of doug band 
band used to be bills huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc 
and band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
band mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned  in speaking fees 
of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus 
we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation 
bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments 
band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place 
band also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote 
band was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them 
banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part 
band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year 
teneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary chairman clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june  memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment 
bill clinton was initially paid  million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason 
and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining 
but band outlined that kelly his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between  and  as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with kellys state department ethics agreement 
kellys multiple roles came together during one state department event in  when thensecretary clinton recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked kelly for his work on the issue 
dow became one of teneos first major clients according to bands memo dow chief executive andrew liveris had been introduced to bill clinton over a round of golf with kelly in august

clintons ties to the common good va  a virginia state pac run by clintons longtime friend and advisor terry mcauliffe its governor  came under scrutiny this week after the wall street journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of jill mccabe 
her husband andrew mccabe led the fbi investigation into clintons emails 
andrew mccabe now the deputy director of the fbi told the wall street journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the clinton probe until months after his wifes unsuccessful state senate bid ended 
common good va was the largest single donor to jill mccabes campaign election records show giving her  between june and october of  
she was the thirdlargest recipient of money from the group which can only contribute to virginia state candidates 
her campaign also received an additional  from the democratic party of virginia a group over which mcauliffe exerts significant control combined the money made up nearly onethird of her total funding 
now mccabe a pediatrician suddenly decided to run for public office unopposed that was certainly nice of the dems to not only put a first timer unopposed but to throw piles and piles of cash at her and some of that cash was coming from a key former clinton foundation man at the center of the latest foundation scandal 
although common good va is only allowed to fund statelevel candidates many of its largest donations came from outside of virginia  including  from clinton foundation official doug band in new york  from clinton loyalist robert johnson in maryland and  from clinton megadonor stephen cloobeck in nevada 
in the following months common good va received several major donations from other close clinton associates including  from bill clintons business partner ron burkle in california and  from ready for hillarys finance committee member leonard lauder in new york

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T14:09:06.081+03:00,obama used religious test to favor muslims over christians,"reprinted from spectatororg  
tom hayden the vietnam war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age  
haydens journey was in many ways tragic born december  in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents were irish catholics who named him after st thomas aquinas and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly haydens friend and exradical david horowitz observed that hayden harbored what irving howe once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote horowitz who seemed in perpetual search of enemies 
hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that thomas aquinas would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society 
hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi jane fonda and literally wrote the script for sds hayden wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which haydens creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade 
right 
haydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june   letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who were killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that haydens sweetheart jane posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by tom hayden at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice 
but not etched in our memory was what might have been tom haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for obama 
the groups members came together in  coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the s sds crowd among the nearly  formal signers to progressives for obama were mark rudd carl davidson jane fonda thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in  then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications 
whereas the likes of obama friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in  by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for obama flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right 
appropriately spearheading progressives for obama was the man who had spearheaded sds tom hayden was one of the four initiators of progressives for obama along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover 
it is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for obama resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december  for their subversive activities aside from the likes of hayden rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for obama were bob pardun who was sds education secretary from  and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds 
among these names from the insane s all were fired up in  over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack obama offered they saw obama as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november   obama won the day and they at last won the day too 
and therein among the progressives for obama the testimony of leader tom hayden was especially revealing 
understand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system hayden went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at obamas alma mater occidental college 
like mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by  he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party 
of course hayden once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in  no matter the party of  was different and warmly accepted him 
hayden was ecstatic over barack obamas presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for obama 
during the  campaign a touched hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of obama in one article titled obama and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community hayden mused 
i didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in  the buds of curiosity quickened 
hayden saw in obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as obama himself had once put it hayden wished that win or lose the obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform obama as well both could reinforce and shape one another 
hayden wrote that in june  when obama was elected later the following november hayden was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that tom hayden saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in  at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by  the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the s kiddies 
the former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for obama once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who were prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured hayden could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for obama he began regularly sounding off against obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer 
with the presidency won hayden and his allies were free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president obamas desire for reform and mandate for change 
in the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under obama hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams 
by this election cycle in  tom hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party 
alas it was fitting that tom hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured 
today at long last for tom hayden and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished",english,frontpagemag.com,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bill-clinton-finger_2.jpg?itok=2tQdtgdI,hate,wife fbi official investigating hillary got k hillary allied pac,obamacare great need punish people using october butbut thought trying help people obamacare visionary jonathan stupidity american voter gruber back last heard man name die hard villain ushered scene explaining stupid everyone architect federal healthcare law said last year lack transparency stupidity american voter helped congress approve obamacare clip unearthed sunday massachusetts institute technology professor jonathan gruber appears panel discusses reform earned enough votes pass suggested many lawmakers voters didnt know law financing worked helped win approval lack transparency huge political advantage gruber said basically call stupidity american voter whatever basically really really critical thing pass gruber made comment discussing law written tortured way avoid bad score congressional budget office suggested voters would rejected obamacare penalties going without health insurance interpreted taxes either budget analysts public cbo scored individual mandate taxes bill dies gruber said gruber back ready explain problem obamacare lack severe beatings sense law fixed law working designed however could work better think probably important thing experts would agree need larger mandate penalty individuals essentially freeriding system theyre essentially waiting get sick getting health insurance whole idea plan pioneered massachusetts individual mandate penalty would bring people system participate penalty right probably low thats something think ideally would fix ideally would penalize gruber everyone involved inflicting monstrosity public predictably grubers proposal offer beatings morale improves pretending anyone isnt obamacare free rider,1,Real

obamas abstention from a un vote against the us is a new low for the most antiamerican administration in american history under obama our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible but actively opposing us policy at the un is a new low 
the resolution ares is on the necessity of ending the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed by the united states of america against cuba 
it was introduced at the request of cuba back in  with a memorandum that accused america of pursuing an aggressive policy against cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political social and economic order which the united states authorities consider most fitting this policy has included direct military intervention the threat of nuclear annihilation the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
as obamas creepy toady ben rhodes tweeted no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
except the failed policy is that of the united states by we rhodes means that obama and the left arent going to defend the united states in international forums when they disagree with the us 
all this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country theyre a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the united states and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the united states 
at the un samantha power took the antiamerican positions to applause from a un united with obama against america 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you

Daniel Greenfield,2016-10-27T04:50:26.351+03:00,project veritas ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago,"realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer 
in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed 
on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america 
this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism 
and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  
gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas 
guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence 
predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community 
the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates 
but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection
