jetzt über die uswahl wissen müssen für die usa ist es ein schicksalstag heute entscheidet sich ob donald trump oder hillary clinton in das weiße haus einziehen wird doch wie genau funktioniert eigentlich die präsidentschaftswahl in den usa hier erfahren sie alles was sie jetzt wissen müssen warum wird in den usa an einem dienstag gewählt die amerikaner wählen nicht dienstags sondern  wie die meisten anderen länder auch  am sonntag durch die zeitverschiebung von rund zwei tagen zwischen den usa general motor time und deutschland mittelhochdeutsche winterzeit ist es nur für uns dienstag wann genau erfahre ich hier in deutschland wer die uswahl gewonnen hat voraussichtlich im herbst  spätestens dann sollte der auf die wahl folgende bürgerkrieg ausgefochten und einer der beiden kandidaten siegreich aus dem gemetzel hervorgegangen sein ich habe keine wahlbenachrichtigung erhalten was ist nun zu tun laut ihrer ipadresse und ihren facebookposts leben sie nicht in den usa die uswahlen sind  wie der name schon sagt  usbürgern vorbehalten ach so wer darf denn dann wählen wählen darf in den usa jeder mensch der folgende voraussetzungen erfüllt  über  jahre alt so hat jeder drei jahre zeit um das wahlsystem kennenzulernen bevor er seine frustration ab seinem  geburtstag mit alkohol betäuben darf  usbürger bürger der usa wird man entweder durch geburt oder durch ritterschlag der königin von amerika  patriot wer kein patriot ist darf nicht wählen um als patriot anerkannt zu werden muss man mindestens einmal nachweislich sex mit der usamerikanischen flagge gehabt haben  jemand anderes als sie wer sie ist darf nicht wählen also vergessen sies einfach achtung jeder usbürger hat nur eine stimme das heißt dass bürger die schon bei einer der letzten präsidentschaftswahlen abgestimmt haben automatisch disqualifiziert sind wird der uspräsident direkt gewählt nein der uspräsident wird nicht direkt vom volk gewählt das volk wählt lediglich sogenannte wahlmänner die wiederum innerhalb von  tagen einen ihrer freunde damit beauftragen müssen einen geeigneten nachbarn auszusuchen dessen tante väterlicherseits dann auf dem großen tantenkonvent in washington dc gemeinsam mit den anderen entsandten tanten den präsidenten bestimmt nachteil für den wähler dadurch kann es passieren dass jemand präsident wird den man selbst gar nicht gewählt hat was passiert bei gleichstand bei gleichstand der stimmen dürfen beide endkandidaten zusammen uspräsident sein in der geschichte der usa kam das lediglich einmal vor  trumancapote was hilft gegen schluckauf es gibt diverse hausmittel so soll es zum beispiel helfen dendie betroffenen zu erschre moment mal bitte nur fragen zur uswahl menno na gut welche bundesstaaten sind am  november entscheidend spannend wird es insbesondere in den sogenannten swingstates sie heißen so weil sie wie das pendel einer uhr unkontrolliert über dem gebiet der usa herumschwingen da die wähler denen es ohnehin von früh bis spät speiübel ist aufgrund der heftigen schwingbewegung ihres staates große schwierigkeiten haben ihr kreuz bei dem kandidaten zu machen den sie wählen wollen gelten sie als unkalkulierbar folgende staaten gelten als swingstates east virginia montezuma haribo ohiowa old baconshire guantanamo und new vada es war so viel von möglichem wahlbetrug die rede  ist das wahrscheinlich wahlbetrug im großen stil im sinne einer mehrfachen oder unberechtigten stimmabgabe ist nach meinung aller experten sehr unwahrscheinlich echte profis manipulieren die wahl indem buh ist der schluckauf weg äh weiter im text indem sie der bevölkerung etwa versprechen ihr land wieder großartig zu machen ohne näher darauf einzugehen wie das gelingen soll welche auswirkungen hat der ausgang der wahl auf deutschland egal wer die wahl gewinnt als deutscher dürfen sie sich grundsätzlich überlegen fühlen und die wähler in den usa für ihre dummheit verachten ob der atomkrieg mit russland am ende aus geostrategischen hardlinerpositionen entsteht clinton oder das ende einer twitterfehde mit wladimir putin ist trump spielt ohnehin keine große rolle ssi dan pfg

donald trump sofort nach amtsantritt durchsetzen wird er wird der mächtigste uspräsident seit jahren mit republikanischen mehrheiten im repräsentantenhaus und im senat kann donald trump die nächsten vier jahre praktisch durchregieren doch welche pläne will der sympathische milliardär eigentlich genau umsetzen hier erfahren sie was präsident trump in den ersten  tagen seiner amtszeit vorhat  weißes haus zu weißem hochhaus ausbauen make america great again  so lautete trumps wahlslogan anfangen mit der greatmakerei will der neue präsident direkt bei seinem amtssitz das weiße haus auf dem künftig in großen goldenen lettern trump white tower stehen wird soll direkt nach trumps amtsantritt im januar  um  etagen aufgestockt werden den lukrativen auftrag zur errichtung des weißen hochhauses soll trumps eigene baufirma erhalten  austritt aus der eu usaxit trump will die vereinigten staaten schnellstmöglich aus der eu austreten lassen es kann nicht sein dass irgendwelche bürokraten in brüssel dem kleinen mann diktieren welche krümmung sein gewehrlauf maximal aufweisen darf ich sage raus aus dieser eu so trump im wahlkampf  alles was obama je getan oder gesagt hat rückgängig machen darauf haben republikaner lange gewartet trump will alle gesetze und jede einzelne amtshandlung obamas so schnell wie möglich rückgängig machen doch nicht nur das auch barack obamas private leistungen sollen nachträglich revidiert werden darunter auch seine doktorarbeit aus dem jahr  zudem soll eine im jahr  von obama gerettete angefahrene katze ausfindig gemacht und getötet werden  rückzug aus krisengebieten donald trump will dass die vereinigten staaten aufhören weltpolizei zu spielen und sich mehr auf sich selbst konzentrieren hierzulande wird das zur folge haben dass unsere politiker behaupten deutschland müsse nun international mehr verantwortung übernehmen was zu mehr aufrüstung und kriegseinsätzen führen wird ganz anders sähe es aus hätte hillary gewonnen sie hätte deutschland zu mehr internationaler verantwortung gedrängt woraufhin deutsche politiker bereitwillig aufgerüstet hätten um mehr kriegseinsätze bewältigen zu können  burkapflicht für alle frauen die keine sieben oder höher sind diese maßnahme liegt donald trump besonders am herzen alle frauen die von dem milliardär visuell weniger als sieben von zehn möglichen punkten erhalten sollen dazu verpflichtet werden ihre unförmigen körper künftig unter einer burka zu verstecken wer der verhüllungspflicht entgehen will kann mit schönheitsoperationen auf der skala nach oben klettern

betriebsgeräusch bekannt und sorgen immer wieder für frust und nachbarschaftsstreit doch derartige probleme dürften bald der vergangenheit angehören ein hersteller aus bochum hat mit dem miles davis ein neuartiges modell vorgestellt bei dem eine trompete das gerät verbaut ist dass statt lästigem surren und rauschen fröhliche musik ertönt chefentwickler roger fähnrich erklärt wie es zu dieser erfindung kam alle versuche leisere laubbläser zu konstruieren scheiterten weil es technisch unmöglich ist den durch blasgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu stundenkilometern erzeugten lärm zu dämpfen daher habe man sich nach wegen umgesehen das geräusch umzuleiten ein kollege der privat einer jazzbigband spielt hatte dann die zündende idee fähnrich er brachte eine alte trompete mit und baute sie den blasschlauch ein der prototyp des miles davis war geschaffen statt nervtötendem laubbläserlärm erzeugt das gerät nun eine fröhliche melodie im einsatz klingt das dann erste kunden sind begeistert mein nachbar hat mich für meinen laubbläser gehasst wenn ich den miles davis anwerfe macht er das fenster auf und wippt fröhlich mit mittlerweile sind wir die besten freunde berichtet friedrich geffner die euphorie ist groß dass sich inzwischen bereits erste laubblasorchester bilden kein wunder dass den bochumer gartenmaschinenhersteller immer mehr anfragen erreichen ob es auch möglich wäre andere blasinstrumente wie saxophon tuba und blockflöte einzubauen ein australischer kunde habe gar den einbau eines didgeridoos angefragt wir arbeiten daran fähnrich auch wenn erste tests mit der tuba sich im alltagsbetrieb als wenig praktikabel erwiesen da aufgrund der erzeugten vibrationen mehr blätter von den umliegenden bäumen fielen als weggeblasen werden konnten ssi dan idee ari bildmaterial

professionellen kopfschutz nicht mehr besteigen durch die neuregelung soll die unfall und verletzungsgefahr deutlich reduziert werden die helmpflicht sei ein wichtiger baustein um die sicherheit in den studios weiter zu erhöhen so der verband deutscher fitness und gesundheitsunternehmen in einer mitteilung zwar sei die gefahr von einem entgegenkommenden pkw erfasst zu werden vergleichsweise gering doch seien schon mehrere sportler vor erschöpfung vom ergometer gefallen oder von einem unaufmerksamen bodybuilder angerempelt oder gar umgestoßen worden zudem erhöhe ein helm das sicherheitsgefühl gerade bei rasanten spinningeinheiten oder berg und talfahrtsimulationen indoorbikes haben keinerlei knautschzone weshalb der kopf besonders geschützt werden muss ebenfalls aus sicherheitsgründen ist es künftig nicht mehr gestattet während der fahrt über kopfhörer musik zu hören oder auf einen bildschirm zu starren wir bauen alle monitore ab so verena hardenberg betreiberin eines privaten fitnessstudios in würzburg es hat sich herausgestellt dass die fahrer dadurch sehr stark abgelenkt werden das risiko ist uns einfach zu groß und in der branche sind bereits weitere maßnahmen im gespräch sollte die helminitiative zu kurz greifen möglicherweise müssen beim spinning demnächst neonfarbene warnwesten übergestreift oder leuchtende katzenaugen mitgeführt werden diese

one thing i have yet to see anyone bring up is how this election could be bait and switch at the last minute in order to understand this however i need to explain the unique possibilities the nwo has created with these two candidates and how this is in fact a very old card from the s 
first we have trump everyone loves trump because trump is not hillary therefore he must be better it is an argument based on the following stalin killed  million and one while mao killed  million and two so stalin is better than mao trump is outright the lets go back to sleep candidate hillary is not already i have seen and heard more than enough about how if only trump goes in then at least four more years have been bought and the nation will survive juts four more years 
from the so called militia and patriots at awrm and the intelligence report they yammer that if only trump goes in then we can postpone the coming war or buy ourselves more time to prepare after all they claim time favors us not the enemy all this bearing in mind that trump has gone back on his word many times changed his mind flip flopped on illegals wants a bigger police state is the most hated in the media etc now lets compare the next runner up quickly 
hillary it is currently chic to hate hillary youre not in style if you like her she will end the nation doom the world and so on never mind that both trump and hillary were put up by the nwo you are not allowed to run otherwise this is old news she is going to cause more war she is a liar cheat she betrayed the nation etc yet both her and trump met with netanyahu behind closed doors and apparently received his blessing to proceed it is a trap and we should all know it and see it clearly she is also the darling of the media 
both of them have in common the s rise to power theme of lenin and hitler both take after these two for both nations germany and russia were in collapse or outright collapsed debauchery was the rule as well as corruption hillary is like lenin she is going in red banners flying and the cheka on her heels to remove any undesirables she is going to finish the job and push the agenda to the hilt even if it takes war to do it trump on the other hand is following hitlers script offering hope without promising anything except a bigger government more powerful police state etc trump will also see the plan to fruition but there is a subtle nuance between these two one is offering to do it with an iron fist in a velvet glove the other is simply the iron fist 
now comes the problem people are not seeing if they force hillary in despite all the public outrage then we know for a fact they have reached a level of preparation that is adequate to dealing with public backlash even insurrection should it be minor or full if they put trump in then they are taking the back street approach because they have not gathered the resources yet to put us down and need to put someone in who will quiet the public just like obama did for a time this election is about purchasing time nothing more nothing less 
if trump is put in then already we can see that most are going straight back to bed and not getting up for another four years at minimum maybe eight the militias and other patriot groups will declare a partial victory and that they can bury their guns again and whistle dixie they are mortified of having to take action so trump is their obvious choice hillary on the other hand represents that steamroller coming down the hill at full tilt they do not want that and seek to avoid it rather than fight it the reality is time does not favor us here time favors the enemy if time favored us then we would not be here diminished and in dire straits imagine how much could have been avoided had the militia stood up during waco again time favored the enemy ruby ridge time favored the enemy as they whittle away and build their power base up bit by bit they are not fools 
consider those two possibilities then consider this if trump goes in and goes along with the war with russia if indeed that is the plan for ww they laid out more than sixity years ago admittedly people are far more willing to join trumps army and go fight than they would hillary something else to consider is perhaps they want a second civil war put hillary in knowing it will cause an insurrection fake one which we know they can do have trump reluctantly take the reins and like davis lead the way in marching the fools single file into the enemy guns just like the first one causing mass casualties for nothing a second civil war of this sort would favor the enemy for it would absolutely end the nation but who would fight for hillary oh right thats why they are bringing in all those foreigners and foreign troops just change the uniform quickly and voila some would suggest this would favor the american nationals not really rather than fight intelligently for the bill of rights they would be fighting for trump they would be fighting to bleed us dry like the confederates did in the civil war fighting by the rules and it cost them dearly only by fighting by our own rules can we win trump would allow them to guide the slaughter one way or another all the while weakening us remember the end game is to destroy absolutely the last vestiges of americans and our culture whatever may be left of it which is not much if anything 
perhaps the above is where those warning about the coming breakup of america will occur perhaps perhaps not but they now have the option to do so i want you to think on all this and let your mind run wild with other possibilities but just remember that they are right now lining the ducks up you while the firing squad is forming up and loading their rifles no matter what you believe will be the outcome of this and no matter what happens one way or another know that this is all preplanned and they would never allow this situation unless they had a humdinger of a plan hidden just beneath the surface i hope i scratched that surface for you like you they have a plan a b c and d it is why they have succeeded for more than two centuries do not take them for the fool they have proven they are not 
so maybe we will get trump and the populace will quiet down while the communists march on with a different uniform cheka versus gestapo then again hillary might go in and just finish things and be done with it or prep the nation for the next phase no matter what happens be ready for it and do not let them sucker you into believing this honest or that trump is honest they are both in on it together they merely represent two different paths for them to reach their ultimate goal share this",german,der-postillon.com,https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KPp1fzVKeEc/U_XOjN6MAfI/AAAAAAAAbGI/l0EIgLScvmY/w1200-h630-p-nu/Fotolia_39329172_S.jpg,bs,facebook geht gegen fakenews vor alle meldungen von bildde und focusde gelöscht,notify followup comments email notify new posts email security question please leave two fields asis important able proceed need solve following simple math know human doom bloom,1,

The Funny Farmer,2016-10-28T15:53:01.191+03:00,plane carrying pence skids off runway at laguardia airport,yahoo news portland ore ap  a jury delivered an extraordinary blow to the government thursday in a longrunning battle over the use of public lands when it acquitted all seven defendants involved in the armed occupation of a national wildlife refuge in rural southeastern oregon tumult erupted in the courtroom after the verdicts were read when an attorney for group leader ammon bundy demanded his client be immediately released repeatedly yelling at the judge us marshals tackled attorney marcus mumford to the ground used a stun gun on him several times and arrested him us district judge anna brown said she could not release bundy because he still faces charges in nevada stemming from an armed standoff at his father cliven bundys ranch two years ago the portland jury acquitted bundy his brother ryan bundy and five others of conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the malheur national wildlife refuge  miles southeast of portland even attorneys for the defendants were surprised by the acquittals its stunning its a stunning victory for the defense said robert salisbury attorney for defendant jeff banta im speechless said defendant neil wampler this is a tremendous victory for rural america and it is a welldeserved overwhelming defeat for a corrupt and predatory federal government the us attorney in oregon billy j williams issued a statement defending the decision to bring charges against the seven defendants we strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a court publicly tried and decided by a jury a bundy daughter bailey logue said family members were savoring the victory and would begin friday to determine their next step first thing were going to get down on our knees and thank our heavenly father and were going to enjoy our families logue said tomorrow were going to figure out what were going to do next messages left for bundy family matriarch carol bundy in bunkerville nevada werent immediately returned the oregon case is a continuation of the tense standoff with federal officials at cliven bundys ranch in  cliven ammon and ryan bundy are among those who are to go on trial in nevada early next year for that standoff while the charges in oregon accused defendants of preventing federal workers from getting to their workplace the case in nevada revolves around allegations of a more direct threat an armed standoff involving dozens of bundy backers pointing weapons including assaultstyle rifles at federal bureau of land management agents and contract cowboys rounding up cattle near the bundy ranch outside bunkerville daniel hill attorney for ammon bundy in the nevada case said he believed the acquittal in oregon bodes well for his client and the other defendants facing felony weapon conspiracy and other charges when the jury here hears the whole story i expect the same result hill told the associated press in las vegas hill also said hell seek his clients release from federal custody pending trial in nevada ammon bundy and his followers took over the oregon bird sanctuary on jan  they objected to prison sentences handed down to dwight and steven hammond two local ranchers convicted of setting fires they demanded the government free the father and son and relinquish control of public lands to local officials the bundys and other key figures were arrested in a jan  traffic stop outside the refuge that ended with police fatally shooting robert lavoy finicum an occupation spokesman most occupiers left after his death but four holdouts remained until feb  when they surrendered following a lengthy negotiation federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case finishing with a display of more than  guns seized after the standoff an fbi agent testified that  live rounds and nearly  spent casings were found during trial bundy testified that the plan was to take ownership of the refuge by occupying it for a period of time and then turn it over to local officials to use as they saw fit bundy also testified that the occupiers carried guns because they would have been arrested immediately otherwise and to protect themselves against possible government attack the bird sanctuary takeover drew sympathizers from around the west it also drew a few protesters who were upset that the armed occupation was preventing others from using the land they included kieran suckling executive director of the center for biological diversity suckling on thursday called the acquittals extremely disturbing for anyone who cares about americas public lands the rights of native people and their heritage and a political system that refuses to be bullied by violence and racism the bundy clan and their followers peddle a dangerous brand of radicalism aimed at taking over lands owned by all of us i worry this verdict only emboldens the kind of intimidation and rightwing violence that underpins their movement suckling said one of ammon bundys attorneys morgan philpot had a different perspective after watching mumford get tackled by marshals his liberty was just assaulted by the very government that was supposed to protect it by the very government that just prosecuted his client  unjustly as the jury found theres another oregon trial coming up over the wildlife refuge authorities had charged  occupiers with conspiracy eleven pleaded guilty and another had the charge dropped seven defendants chose not to be tried at this time their trial is

for instance a nonindian garage owner is married to a sioux woman who sides with the opponents  while he finds the whole controversy a nuisance 
i think most of the people around here native and nonnative would like to see it end its a big inconvenience all the traffic the cops i am for the pipeline north dakota is an oilproducing state he said and its the safest way to transport it

a large map with the slogan pray for the redoubt hangs behind the till at warren campbells army surplus store located just outside coeur dalene idaho 
campbell moved his family from california about a year and a half ago in part because he believes the us economy is on the verge of collapse but also to get more god and less government in his life and to live around likeminded people 
the american redoubt is a stronghold its the last bastion for god country liberty constitution second amendment and home schooling he said warren campbell inside his army surplus store redoubt surplus and tactical near coeur dalene idaho erin collinscbc 
a redoubt is a littleused military term that refers to a temporary fortification the american redoubt is both a movement and an unofficial geographic zone that includes idaho wyoming montana and the eastern parts of washington and oregon 
the term was coined in  by survivalist james wesley rawles who identified the region as the best place to wait out a disaster in the us be it natural economic or political 
rawles sees the redoubt as a place where mostly conservative christian americans who are worried about the future should move and prepare for the worst the goal is to create a safe haven where likeminded americans many of whom refer to themselves as preppers can live off the land be more selfsufficient and wait out the calamities to come the holy cause of liberty 
past the tactical gear and through a hallway at the back of redoubt surplus and tactical  youll find pastor warren campbells other venture the lordship church  
adorned in military garb and sporting an abe lincolnstyle beard campbell sets out folding metal chairs to get ready for his weekend service where about three dozen people usually come to hear him preach 
we love to preach on liberty the holy cause of liberty  george washington called liberty a sacred fire and our liberties are very very dear to us especially the liberties we have in jesus christ pastor warren campbell inside his makeshift church connected to his army surplus store in northern idaho erin collinscbc 
campbell says hes met dozens of people who have recently moved to the area mostly from california and colorado because theyre frustrated with what they feel is government overreach including rising taxes stiffer gun regulations and the affordable care act or obamacare 
he says hell likely vote for republican presidential candidate donald trump on nov  primarily because he believes a hillary clinton administration would erode religious freedoms and the right to bear arms 
and despite the polls campbell believes trump will win if he doesnt he expects the redoubt will get a lot more crowded 
i think we will see a great influx of people more than we are seeing right now multiplying by thousands coming here for safety and refuge 
with all the mudslinging and scandal that has defined this us presidential campaign perhaps it shouldnt be surprising theres talk of political migration 
once again this election cycle some democrats including several celebrities  have threatened to move to canada should their candidate lose 
folks in the redoubt suspect plenty of trump supporters will consider a move of their own if their candidate loses although not quite as far north people want to feel safe 
a short drive away customers peruse the display cases at ed santoss busy post falls gun shop and shooting range theyre served by staff wearing side arms who show off everything from handguns to automatic weapons 
the american redoubt is a stronghold its the last bastion for god country liberty constitution second amendment and home schooling  warren campbell owner of redoubt surplus and tactical 
santos says many of the people coming through his shop these days are new arrivals looking for a fresh start and a quieter more peaceful life 
many of the things that attracted my wife and i to this area are the same things that are attracting people today  people want to live in a place that feels like a community people want to feel safe when they go out at night 
santos a former army officer cop and minor pro hockey referee says the facility is signing up new members every day and many of them the vast majority of them in fact are from out of this area ed santos fires a pistol inside the gun range attached to his port falls idaho gun shop 
more than  kilometres east that search for safety and community drew chuck leveque and his wife to a wooded property in the isolated foothills of flathead county mont 
the former las vegas vice cop says his biggest worry is that terrorists could knock out americas electrical grid 
leveque opens the creaky doors of a large shipping container in his yard to show how hes prepared for the threat 
this is our fuel storage container and we have a tank with  gallons of diesel and a tank with  gallons of nonethanol regular gasoline 
the fuel will run leveques generator in the event of a prolonged power outage he says hes stored enough food and water for him and his wife to survive for up to four years 
but leveque believes he will also need to protect what hes stored from those who are less prepared so like many people here in the redoubt he has stockpiled weapons and ammunition too chuck leveque opens up the sea lift container that holds two tanks of fuel to run his generator in case the power grid goes down erin collinscbc 
the us and montana in particular is a gun culture and in the event of a large catastrophe we would need the guns to defend ourselves against people who would want to take our property and our preparedness stores 
in the meantime he worries the countrys political and economic power is waning saddled with too much debt and a political system that has ground to a halt 
its a problem he expects will get worse after the presidential campaign 
no matter which way the election turns out there is going to be a lot of angst by either side canning bullion and bullets 
inside a nondescript industrial mall near kalispell mont dj lebaron puts the finishing touches on a can of dehydrated eggs inside his store big sky preppers  
lebaron who is originally from southern alberta provides survival products and training including how to can everything from gold bullion to bullets 
you want to pack them tight so that they dont sound like bullets if somebody shakes it he said 
for lebaron life in the redoubt is about hoping for the best and preparing for the worst its a mantra he adopted while working with fema americas disaster management agency during the earthquake that rocked the san francisco bay area in  
when bad things happen people that you have called your friends for years are no longer your friends he said when people are cold tired and hungry they forget all about friendships 
his biggest worry is that a natural disaster like an earthquake or flood will disrupt normal life in america but he says the growing uncertainty about americas political and economic future is a close second 
he says trump presents conservatives in the redoubt with a difficult choice this election 
people if they are voting are going to be voting for trump but people dont want trump because nobody can control him and they are worried about what he will do so i guess i will call that a manmade disaster 
he expects the divisions this presidential campaign has reinforced across the country will remain long after the election and will feed some americans desire to retreat to the redoubt

since the water crisis started in june the municipality has been able to supply water for only one hour twice a week taha told al jazeera i am checking the weather forecast every day they announced rain three weeks ago but it has not come yet the only thing i can do is to pray to god 
many west bank communities are facing similar problems amid an acute water shortage that has lasted for months in the salfit jenin and hebron governorates some villages have gone as long as  days in a row without running water 
in midjuly residents in the bethlehem area staged a sitin for days to protest against the shortages sparking clashes between palestinian youths and israeli forces 
it is a very stressful situation i have to consider and prioritise every single drop of water i use taha said we have barely enough to drink cook shower and use the bathroom sometimes i dont do the laundry or clean the house for weeks it is hot and dusty this is exhausting enas taha shows her garden which has turned brown due to the severe water shortages since june eloise bollackal jazeera 
some palestinians have joked that the water bill collector comes to their homes more often than water as demand rises the cost of drinking water has skyrocketed with some families spending up to  percent of their meagre incomes to purchase it 
israel implements a policy of water cuts each summer but this year it reached an unprecedented peak in early june israeli water company mekorot informed the palestinian water authority pwa of summertime supply cuts totalling more than  percent  and the cuts while not as dramatic remain in effect today more than a month after the official end of summer 
we are in regular contact with mekorot to find a solution but they constantly give us different excuses such as the increase in demand rising temperature etc deeb abdelghafour the pwas director of the water resources department told al jazeera 
the notion that the region is suffering from water scarcity is a myth he added 
we have been facing shortages for decades and the reason is not natural but manmade  meaning the israeli occupation and israeli control over water resources in the palestinian territories 
israeli officials have stated that water resources are shared equally in israel and the occupied palestinian territories israels coordinator of government activities in the territories a unit in the israeli army noted that israel provides  million cubic metres of water to the palestinians annually even though it is only obliged to provide  million under the oslo accords 
however disparity is evident in the lush gardens parks and swimming pools in illegal israeli settlements the key difference is that palestinian villages in the west bank are not connected to the national water grid relying instead on local underground supplies 
palestinians living in remote areas have been hit the hardest by the ongoing water crisis as access roads are often poor and the additional costs of delivery result in higher prices 
we need special  trucks to drive on the unpaved roads and it can take up to two hours to reach the communities said hafez hureini a resident of attuwani village and leader of the south hebron hills popular committee taha shows her empty beehives last year we had bees so we could produce our own honey but all the bees died due to lack of water there are not enough flowers eloise bollackal jazeera 
over the summer israeli media reported that illegal jewish settlements in the west bank were also suffering from daily disruptions to water supplies prompting the israeli government to establish a new drilling site ariel  which would provide  cubic metres of water per hour 
abdelrahman tamimi director of the palestinian hydrology group for water and environmental resources development said that this was not where water was needed the most 
the wells should be drilled where there is important demand such as north and south of jenin south of hebron or northwest of the jordan valley why in ariel i wonder as a hydrologist there is already a well there they can simply improve its capacity  this measure was definitely not designed to supply palestinian communities tamimi told al jazeera 
in the meantime israel has accused palestinians of tapping into pipes with the israeli water authority asserting that  cubic metres of water is stolen every day by palestinians 
we are aware there is water theft  however we should ask ourselves why are the people stealing water simply because they are thirsty abdelghafour said 
at the same time increased water demands owing to growing israeli and palestinian populations is stretching the limits of existing water infrastructure most of the water network was installed in  when israel occupied the west bank today the diameters of the pipes are inadequate and the system is reaching the end of its life cycle 
even to upgrade infrastructure in area a and b is a headache abdelghafour said they israel impose long and complicated procedures in order to issue permits to import the smallest pieces or equipment 
data released by the israeli water authority shows that a large expansion in agriculture in the settlements has led to an estimated rise of  to  percent in water consumption this year 
the palestinian authority has no solution for the water crisis in my opinion israel has used this summer to put more pressure on us to purchase desalinated water so they can allocate groundwater for the settlements and their future expansion tamimi said 
since  five desalination plants have been built in israel now producing approximately  percent of the countrys water supply 
we dont want to substitute water from desalination plants for our historical rights to all shared water resources abdelghafour said once we have our basic rights based on equitable allocation of resources and international law then we can think of other development options such as desalination or treatment of waste water the original source of this article is al

juror  vigorously defends the acrosstheboard acquittals of ammon bundy and his six codefendants calling the rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge 
the fulltime marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no  who the judge bounced from the jury a day later 
it should be known that all  jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself  and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror  wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonianoregonlive 
he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number 
the jury closely followed us district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the fiveweek trial he said 
the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the us fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation 
juror  noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict 
all  agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote 
but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout 
prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said 
they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov  when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan  and serve out a mandatory minimum fiveyear sentence for arson on federal land 
defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mixup the effect of the occupation  which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs  from the intent of the occupiers 
five of the seven defendants including ammon bundy testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change 
the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror  noted 
inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to  diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof 
juror  plainly stated that fellow juror  during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place 
juror  had worked for the us bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than  years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really 
juror  explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror  on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased 
it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror  sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror  for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror s alleged bias fell 
juror  said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself 
in his email to the oregonianoregonlive juror  for the first time also contended that juror  violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions 
juror  said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us 
the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals 
dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdicts might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us 
the jury he said met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the us marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford 
he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge such as criminal trespass wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty 
the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison 
we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option juror  said

the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation 
click here to read the letter 
comey did not detail those emails saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case 
he told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
he said the fbi could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete this additional work 
a senior law enforcement official separately told fox news the fbi decision is not linked to wikileaks messages or any hack and the newly discovered emails did not come from the clinton server  but from another device from another government official 
the move comes after comey and the justice department decided in july not to pursue charges over clintons email practices saying at the time that the investigation was finished 
comey has since come under criticism from donald trump lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during clintons tenure 
trump speaking to cheering supporters friday afternoon in manchester nh praised the fbi for having the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made  saying he hopes that is corrected 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before trump said we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office 
in a nod to the significance of the fbis announcement trump quipped the rest of my speech is going to be so boring 
other gop lawmakers also weighed in urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe 
the fbis decision to reopen its investigation into secretary clinton reinforces what the house judiciary committee has been saying for months the more we learn about secretary clintons use of a private email server the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte rva said in a statement 
republican national committee chairman reince priebus said the discovery must be serious for the bureau to investigate this close to the election 
clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in cedar rapids iowa and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city 
the development comes  days before the general election and is the latest shockwave to hit the race clinton had been gaining in the polls over trump in the wake of the release of footage showing trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him 
however daily revelations from hacked clinton campaign emails obtained by wikileaks have become a headache for the democrats campaign the resumption of the fbi probe poses a potentially bigger problem 
ron hosko former assistant director of the fbi told fox news in a telephone interview that retired fbi officials were livid at comey over the fact that charges were not brought against clinton in round one of the investigation 
he lit her on fire and then walked away hosko said of comey holding a news conference laying out clintons mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges 
hosko said he still defends comey for not pressing charges because the fbi always has to make a decision based on what they have at the time hosko said he thinks agents were probing a separate matter and found emails that made them say oh my god look at what we have

the de blasio administration is trying to limit the number of food trucks in the city by claiming that each hotdog and kabob cart causes more pollution than a truck ride to los angeles 
deputy health commissioner corinne schiff made the claim at a city council hearing wednesday in an apparent effort to sink a bill that would nearly double the number of foodvendor permits in the city by  
meat grilling is a significant source of air pollution in the city schiff said one additional vendor grilling meat emits an amount of particle pollution in one day equivalent to what a diesel truck emits driving  miles 
the new bill would boost the number of permits to  by  and also create an enforcement team to sniff out violations 
since  the number of streetfood vending permits has remained steady at  but there are likely more carts than that on the streets as some vendors simply open shop without a license and work until they are caught 
schiff argued any increase in the number of food carts needs to come with regulations stipulating that the carts operate in a more environmentally friendly manner 
city councilman mark levine dmanhattan who is sponsoring the bill to increase the permits wondered if this was already the case we have laws in the city about air quality that currently stipulate that any food establishment has got to have a hood over a grill levine said is that not currently the law 
schiff however said there are no such laws regulating the carts as she suggested the proposals be delayed to ensure better pollution safeguards 
we really see this as an opportunity to work with the council to think through how we might use this modernization act to improve air quality she said the current laws dont actually control the emissions that were concerned about 
businessimprovement districts and residents throughout the city also pushed for delays on increasing vendor permits saying there are too many already in some neighborhoods but welcomed increased enforcement 
the enforcement idea is a great idea said ellen baer cochair of the nyc bid association lets see if this works lets see how it works lets see if its sufficiently funded lets see how many resources they need  before we start adding to the chaos 
but street vendors argued theyve waited too long for reforms that would allow them to transition from operating illegally to legally 
sean basinski director of the street vendor project described the bills as far from our dream but said he supports most of what they call for 
it is a reasonable compromise he said vendors have been waiting  years for this change    we certainly welcome a study being done but we dont think that should delay the progress that needs to be made the time for reform is now 
before the hearing some vendors rallied outside demanding that city officials and police stop harassing them and treating them like criminals 
the bill will remain before the committee while members discuss possible changes",english,fromthetrenchesworldreport.com,http://www.fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/images/default-user-image.png,bs,fbi reopens clinton email investigation new messages found,notify followup comments email notify new posts email security question please leave two fields asis important able proceed need solve following simple math know human doom bloom,1,

this election remains more heated than any other in modern history  and for many it has become a call to arms even if only metaphorically 
despite the fact that dnc operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies  robert creamer and scott foval for example  and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote  the media is going out of its way to paint trump supporters and grassroots americans as the ones plotting violence 
most recently they are latching onto comments made by former congressman joe walsh now a conservative radio host who suggested he would pick up a musket if trump loses the election on november th im voting for trump 
on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket 
you in 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
did walsh mean to imply violence that is certainly how the media is portraying it as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election 
the irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of foundingera patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left who see opponents to hillary in black and white terms  racist xenophobic utterly deplorable and inherently violent 
cnn followed up asking walsh what he meant by statement 
via cnn  
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president  
walsh  did respond to cnns jake tapper via twitter when he asked what exactly does that mean 
it means protesting participating in acts of civil disobedience doing what it takes to get our country back he responded to tapper jaketapper it means protesting participating in acts of civil disobedience doing what it takes to get our country back 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
after a firestorm on social media walsh doubled down stating on twitter im serious i dont think a musket would do much good these days but its time for civil disobedience on the right httpstcothjpebalwz 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
his heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud dirty trick and foul play by the hillary campaign as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female potus  just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about 
 erupted in response to a long train of abuses  acts of oppression and hostility listed in the declaration of independence that is being largely repeated in modern day america 
could hillarys reported election victory  or donald trumps defeat  signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or rigged trump for one has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election 
the scenario is plausible enough that the pentagon and homeland security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest 
as shtf detailed in an exclusive report a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep andor restore order if the populace revolt against the establishments selection for president 
if there is any truth to it the  election could be a kickoff for total tyranny 
according to an unnamed source  who has provided accurate intel in the past  an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after 
date october th   days after the election suspected region northeast specifically new york

nd phase lrol limited rule of law  militaryfema consolidating resources controlling water supply handing out to public as needed 
rd phase arol authoritarian rule of law  possible new acronym or term for martial law curfew restricted movements basically martial law scenario 
source said exercise involves femadhsmilitary 
at this point no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of november  but it is clear that millions and millions of americans are dissatisfied with the status quo troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the fed and angry that hillary may be put in the oval office rather than a jail cell despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end

a public school official in florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated  including homeschool families 
it is all part of an antitruancy initiative called operation round up in which residents of jackson county florida are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police 
a truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriffs deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents tv station wjhg reported 
the policy of the jackson county school district is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants 
sometimes if these citizens dont call me i have no way of knowing shirl williams director of student services for the school system told the tv station so if its a nosy neighbor be a nosy neighbor just call me and let me check out the situation 
williams acknowledged that homeschool children can be mistaken for truants but urged citizens to report them so school authorities can investigate 
sometimes the community will see them around town and they think hey theyre not being educated sometimes the community is right williams said 
home school legal defense association attorney tj schmidt wrote williams and the jackson county superintendent saying that while truancy is a problem homeschoolers should not be targeted 
your statements suggest that everyone should report children they think arent being educated the letter read in our opinion this is a threatening practice and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community

the ohio resident spoke to koin  news before stepping onto the streets of downtown portland for the first time in  months 
fry said he was excited to reunite with family and friends to celebrate the victory adding that his plight to end corruption is far from overits a wonderful feeling to be acquitted by the highest authority in this country fry said i definitely feel this was divine intervention playing in this

he said guards at multnomah county jail treated him as if he were guilty and that inmates are not often dealt with fairly or under the presumption of innocence 
i guess this is the greatest example of why you dont treat people as guilty because they can be acquitted fry said 
fry was one of the last  holdouts at the refuge and helped broadcast the final days of the standoff through youtube livestreams he allegedly threatened to commit suicide while on the phone with fbi crisis negotiators before he surrendered 
defense attorneys called his father william fry to the witness stand to discuss his motives for joining the occupation william said his son was frustrated with corruption and wanted to support dwight and steve hammond who he believed were falsely characterized as terrorists

do the committees that oversee the vast us spying apparatus take intelligence community whistleblowers seriously do they earnestly investigate reports of waste fraud abuse professional negligence or crimes against the constitution reported by employees or contractors working for agencies like the cia or nsa for the last  years the answer has been a resounding no 
my own experience in  is illustrative over a twoyear period working with my wife robin who was a cia detailee to a senate committee at the time we discovered that contrary to the public statements by thenchairman of the joint chiefs colin powell and other senior george h w bush administration officials including cia director john deutch american troops had in fact been exposed to chemical agents during and after the  war with saddam hussein while the senate banking committee under thenchairman don riegle dmich was trying to uncover the truth of this officials at the pentagon and cia were working to bury it 
at the cia i objected internally  and was immediately placed under investigation by the cias office of security that became clear just days after we delivered the first of our several internal briefings to increasingly senior officials at the cia and other intelligence agencies in february  i received a phone call from cia security asking whether id had any contacts with the media i had not but i had mentioned to cia officials wed met with that i knew that the cbs newsmagazine  minutes was working on a piece about the gulf war chemical coverup this call would not be the last id receive from cia security about the matter nor the only action the agency would take against us

new york city new york  donald j trump the republican nominee for president has closed the gap with his democratic opponent hillary rodham clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election the latest national breitbart news networkgravis marketing poll shows 
clinton at  percent leads trump at  percent by just one pointinside the surveys  percent margin of error libertarian gary johnson gets just  percent and the green partys dr jill stein just  percent while  percent are unsure the survey was conducted from oct  to oct  sampling  registered voters across the united states the poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users 
something has happened since the third debate doug kaplan the managing partner of gravis marketing said of the poll conventional wisdom was after trump said he wouldnt promise to accept the results of the election and made the nasty woman comment many thought hillary would gainbut trump seems to be closing the gap in every election in the last  years this happens where the person behind closes the gap hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory however trump is not out of it but hillary is still the favorite 
this is a big story because it shows trump really closing importantly as the other close polls are showing democratic pollster pat caddell who worked for president jimmy carter and is working with breitbart news and gravis marketing on these polls added he is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well 
caddell said he thinks obamacares failures where premiums are skyrocketing is one of many reasons why trump is surging among other things that is contributing to trumps rise in the polls caddell said when we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issuethat thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees which is another big issue but more importantly at the end of the survey we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead theyre basically about the same which i consider a real improvement for trump now that hes that close",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-27-16-merica.jpg,conspiracy,vote hillary vote world war,putin mocks clinton claim russia election meddling us banana republic us banana republic america great power im wrong correct american mirror october comments hillary clinton claims shes candidate stand vladimir putin shes also candidate apparently believes united states vulnerable enough prevent russia meddling november presidential election russian president putin mocked notion thursday vladimir putin anyone really think russia could influence american peoples choice way whatis us banana republic pictwittercomngqhjratp anyone seriously think russia influence choice american people putin told group academics sochi us banana republic america great power im wrong correct hillary clinton repeatedly blamed russia disclosures campaign operative emails wikileaks never history country situation adversary foreign power working hard influence outcome election clinton said second presidential debate believe theyre get elected theyre try influence election donald trump anything goes wrong blame russia trump told crowd ocala florida days later hacked people dont know always blame russia say donald trump friends putin dont know putin folks trump added hell putin newsletter sign get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles,1,

several schools across the nation have decided to close on election day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail 
the fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways endangering students 
if anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election then they arent paying much attention ed tolan the falmouth maine police chief said tuesday his community has already called off classes on nov  and an increased police presence will be felt around town 
and without a doubt voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security we have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past but we also need to realize that times have changed i believe that there is wisdom in what georgia secretary of state brian kemp told reporters  
there is a concern just like at a concert sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have  or  years ago said georgia secretary of state brian kemp cochairman of the national association of secretaries of state election committee  what if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something if that happens at a school then thats certainly concerning 
all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything 
let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that 
another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud this is something that donald trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail for instance just consider what he told a rally in pennsylvania  
we dont want to lose an election because you know what im talking about trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in manheim pa earlier this month because you know what thats a big big problem and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places  
and of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines in illinois this week one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from republicans to democrats 
early voting in illinois got off to a rocky start monday as votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats 
republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library 
i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat 
in addition if you keep up with my work on the economic collapse blog  then you already know that a number of voters down in texas have reported that their votes were switched from donald trump to hillary clinton  
well it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the clinton foundation  
according to opensecrets the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of the mccarthy group 
the mccarthy group is a major donor to the clinton foundation  apparently donating  dollars in   when it was the largest owner of united states voting machines or perhaps the  dollars went to paying bill clinton for speeches 
either way it doesnt look good 
after everything that we saw in   i am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines 
but democrats dont like poll observers because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters 
its unamerican but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that  ari berman author of the  book  give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in america  previously told the christian science monitor voting was very very dangerous i dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today i just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic 
without a doubt this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades and i have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier 
but will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  
if that is the outcome after all that we have been through it will be exceedingly depressing indeed newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/281016nuke.jpg,conspiracy,statistical tie latest breitbartgravis poll shows donald trump closes gap less two weeks left,watch cnn called clinton news network air fiery british conservative implosion followed something see image credits wiki commons cnn anchor hala gorani wasnt expecting network called clinton news network british firebrand conservative columnist katie hopkins daily mail watching ensuing implosion mustsee hopkins first offense daring believe donald trump going win election never good way start cnn think hes going win think guys big surprise im quite excited think weve seen similar think uk brexit saw lot liberal press kind sneering brexiteers saw lot sneering see clinton news network thats cnn youre calling us clinton news network gorani said shock youre exactly correct hopkins said two argued media obsessed polls especially ones showing hillary clinton lead hopkins destroyed gorani saying sat republican national convention cleveland watched news network entirely biased think coverage gorani refused believe said year career cnn shes seen nothing balance network oddly enough sparring match continued gorani repeatedly cut hopkins criticized clintons goes theory newsletter sign get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles,1,

islamic indoctrination is now mandatory in german schools 
from the daily express  
pupils at a primary school were forced to chant allahu akhbar and there is no god but allah an appalled father has claimed 
the father of the pupil at the girls primary school in german ski resort garmischpartenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given 
he claimed she had been forced by teachers to memorise the islamic chants and forwarded the handout to austrian news service unsertirol 
the handout read oh allah how perfect you are and praise be to you blessed is your name and exalted is your majesty there is no god but you 
it had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the bavarian school 
what are they going to teach the ethics of conquest and slavery 
heres another story from yesterday in rt  
parents of a german teenager may face a trial and fine for truancy after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his indoctrination by islamic radicals 
the story broke in midjune when parents of a yearold student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern german town of rendsburg reportedly organized as part of a geography class 
in a letter to the class teacher quoted by the ndr the teens father argued that his son would be indoctrinated in the mosque he went on to say that for years we have been hearing reports about religiouslymotivated violence connected with islamic people 
a local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of   referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy 
 alexandra witt alexiastellar october   
when the parents opposed the fine their case was forwarded to peter muellerrakow a local prosecutor who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial spiegel reported on wednesday 
the parents lawyer alexander heumann argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their sons bodily safety 
denying any faithbased motives he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group and are of the opinion that nobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will 
school principal renate fritzsche  told ndr that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity 
we also have muslim children with us and muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions she said adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for muslim children as well it is not the responsibility of the parents to say my child will attend such or such class fritzsche asserted

hillary clinton and the democrats have begun stealing the election using every underhanded tactic because its the only way she can win says clinton insider larry nichols 
shes going to lose and she knows it nichols said on the alex jones show thursday unless she can amass and pull off the biggest amount of voter fraud in the history of this country 
nichols explained that the establishment is already doing what it can to prevent an open and transparent election 
the dnc filed a lawsuit to try to force the removal of poll watchers at the polls he said why would they do that if they know theres no cheating going on why would they fight the voter id if they dont plan to have massive voter fraud 
the mainstream media and the clinton campaign are also doing everything they can up until election day to make everybody believe that the election is already over in hillarys favor nichols said 
folks do not believe it he said the polling is a part of this game plan to destroy your confidence in your ability to win 
i believe donald trump is winning nichols added youre winning youve just got to stay the course

The Alex Jones Show,2016-10-28T21:12:27.535+03:00,trump votes are being flipped to clinton,"big pharma targets profits in rare diseases all of the worlds most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions image credits stocksnappixabay  
one might think big pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more wellknown diseases but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next big thing in rare diseases 
big pharmas profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments 
the search for the next moneymaker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments which may explain why they still havent discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the worlds population 
in  the orphan drug act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs werent as profitable 
because of the incentives which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees over  new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced 
for common illnesses big pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug for example liptior atorvastatin which is used to regulate cholesterol generates a sales profit of  billion with the prescription only costing patients around  per day 
but with rare diseases prices must be kept high in order to keep big pharma in business this means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures their pocketbooks are in for a hit 
for example the cystic fibrosis drug kalydeco by vertex costs individual patients  
gileads sovaldi used to treat hepatitis c cashes in at  for a paltry week course of medication 
and soliris used to treat rare blood conditions costs the patient a whopping  per year

the fbi on friday announced it is reopening their investigation into hillary clintons private email server another shocking october surprise for the democrat candidate days from the presidential election 
in a letter to committees and lawmakers relevant to the matter fbi director james comey cited recent developments for the bureaus decision to look into new emails which may contain classified information and how they may relate to its previous investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote in the letter obtained by cnbc  
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be signifcant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey stated 
republican congressman jason chaffetz who led an oversight committee effort to pursue perjury charges against hillary  tweeted about the fbis announcement fbi dir just informed me the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation case reopened 
 jason chaffetz jasoninthehouse october   
back in july comey announced the fbis investigation into clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state would not result in a recommendation to the justice department to pursue charges 
although the department of justice makes final decisions on matters like this we are expressing to justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case the fbi director stated in a speech at the time trump i have great respect that the fbi and department of justice have the courage to right their horrible mistake pictwittercomledngwvqa

the fbi has just sent a letter to congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former secretary of state hillary clintons investigation and they are reopening their case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the united states of america 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office

Fiona Miller,2016-10-28T21:12:37.671+03:00,big pharma targets profits in rare diseases,"is deindustrialization a natural phenomenon of developed economies increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices jörg guido hülsmann  misesorg   
let me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up 
economic growth typically entails a reallocation of labor away from industrial production but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output the decline of industrial production in the us and france in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor business and financial regulations education policies social security funding and taxation this decline cannot be stopped through more interventions even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country 
now let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions 
the reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the workingage population further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods preparing industrial activity coordinating and monitoring supply chains lowquality bluecollar labor diminishes whereas there is some increase in highquality bluecollars but especially an increase in whitecollars working in and around the supply chains 
increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards thus the blossoming of artistic intellectual and scientific activities in developed countries at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits 
as a natural consequence of economic growth therefore industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people but this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment germany provides an example 
in the past thirty years western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the east and far east this reallocation of capital though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy has been detrimental in the shortrun to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used 
but capital investments in countries such as france and the us have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept lowpaying and nongratifying industrial jobs massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling reduce the supply of qualified manual labor and create an artificial bias among the workingage population for scientific intellectual and artistic activities panoply of regulations have on the one hand increased the costs of doing business and on the other hand stimulated rentseeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers accountants auditors and financial advisors all at the expense of ordinary business 
these tendencies cannot be stopped through socalled reindustrialization policies which boil down to even more government spending premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible and often also inexperienced politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources such policies have utterly failed in the past airbus included and will fail in the future genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry it requires nothing less than a rollback of the artificial obstacles for industrial development that government interventions have created in past generations",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-21-16-shadow-1.jpg,conspiracy,breaking fbi reopens investigation clinton emails,email got john podesta hacked latest wikileaks dump reveals phishing email compromised podesta mikael thalen october comments email lead hack clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account published online friday wikileaks malicious march email claims google asked podesta change password due unauthorized access ip address ukraine clinton campaign staff members viewed email convinced genuine clinton insider sara latham argued gmail one real even clinton campaign specialist charles delavan said legitimate email first suspicious aspect email unnoticed clinton camp bitly password reset link bitly website shortens long web addresses would found official email google first reported motherboard earlier month examination bitly link redirected podesta fake google webpage also contained several red flags bitly link helped hide fact landing page ended tk instead com web page failed use https encryption links also likely used fool googles spam filters prior analysis phishing link cybersecurity group secureworks revealed hackers also made significant operation security mistake failed make two bitly accounts private public accounts revealed hackers created similar links use gmail accounts october may secureworks notes targets included individuals russia former soviet states current former military government personnel us europe individuals working defense government supply chain authors journalists accounts linked election also hackers sights specific targets include staff working associated hillary clintons presidential campaign democratic national committee dnc including individuals managing clintons communications travel campaign finances advising policy thomas rid professor kings college displayed twitter decoding phishing links could reveal specific emails targeted click enlarge interestingly former secretary state colin powell whose emails released website dcleaks september also targeted hackers click enlarge connection suggests hackers provided wikileaks podesta emails dcleaks powell emails likely one bitly accounts also behind malicious email sent retired fourstar general philip mark breedlove whose emails appeared dcleaks april numerous cybersecurity groups accused russian government responsible election season hacks creating dcleaks guccifer disseminate data us government also publicly blamed russia october one week cia tasked preparing possible retaliatory cyber strike russian president vladimir putin denied involvement arguing contents hacks far important responsible listen even matter hacked data putin said september important thing content given public putin dismissed us hysteria concerning hacks thursday annual speech valdai discussion club sochi hysteria whipped united states influence russia us presidential election said much simpler distract people socalled russian hackers spies agents influence anyone really think russia could influence american peoples choice way america banana republic america great power newsletter sign get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles,1,

Adan Salazar,2016-10-28T22:17:05.766+03:00,breaking fbi reopens investigation into clinton emails,"the email that got john podesta hacked latest wikileaks dump reveals phishing email that compromised podesta mikael thalen  october   comments 
the email that lead to the hack of clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account was published online friday by wikileaks 
the malicious march  email which claims to be from google asked podesta to change his password due to unauthorized access from an ip address in the ukraine 
clinton campaign staff members who viewed the email were convinced it was genuine clinton insider sara latham argued the gmail one is real while even clinton campaign it specialist charles delavan said this is a legitimate email 
the first suspicious aspect of the email unnoticed by the clinton camp was the bitly password reset link bitly a website that shortens long web addresses would not be found in an official email from google 
as first reported by motherboard earlier this month examination of the bitly link that redirected podesta to a fake google webpage also contained several red flags 
the bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in tk instead of com but that the web page itself failed to use https encryption such links were also likely used to fool googles spam filters 
prior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group secureworks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake  they failed to make their two bitly accounts private 
the public accounts revealed the hackers had created  similar links to use against  gmail accounts between october  and may  
secureworks notes that the targets included individuals in russia and the former soviet states current and former military and government personnel in the us and europe individuals working in the defense and government supply chain and authors and journalists 
accounts linked to the  election were also in the hackers sights 
specific targets include staff working for or associated with hillary clintons presidential campaign and the democratic national committee dnc including individuals managing clintons communications travel campaign finances and advising her on policy 
thomas rid a professor at kings college displayed on twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted 
click to enlarge interestingly former secretary of state colin powell whose emails were released by the website dcleaks in september was also targeted by the same hackers 
click to enlarge this connection suggests the hackers who provided wikileaks with the podesta emails and dcleaks with the powell emails are likely one in the same the bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired fourstar general philip mark breedlove  whose emails appeared on dcleaks in april 
numerous cybersecurity groups have accused the russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating dcleaks and guccifer  to disseminate the data the us government also publicly blamed russia on october  just one week before the cia was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory  cyber strike  
russian president vladimir putin has denied involvement arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible 
listen does it even matter who hacked this data putin said on september  the important thing is the content that was given to the public 
putin again dismissed us hysteria concerning the hacks on thursday during an annual speech at the valdai discussion club in sochi 
hysteria has been whipped up in the united states about the influence of russia over the us presidential election he said its much simpler to distract people with socalled russian hackers spies and agents of influence does anyone really think that russia could influence the american peoples choice in any way is america a banana republic or what america is a great power newsletter sign up get the

Infowars Nightly News,2016-10-28T22:37:02.718+03:00,clinton camp desperate russia trains for wwiii,"britain should embrace unilateral free trade right now unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal louis rouanet  misesorg   image credits iker merodio  flickr  
if we read the newspapers or listen to the experts britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the european union without succumbing to the protectionists sirens 
the first is a deal à la norway not only with full access to the common market but also with full implementation of eu law and a contribution to the eu budget as is the case for every member state the second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the eu and canada however a viable third opportunity exists unilateral freetrade 
contrary to what is often assumed unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in todays world unilateral free trade is genuine freetrade it is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace theresa may seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles french planning as it existed in the s and s but the freemarket policy paradigm is more likely to transform postbrexit britain into a flourishing economy 
unilateral free trade the british tradition 
the tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the uk with the victory of the liberals in the s britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from  to at least  free trade was politically unassailable trade treaties however were seen as inherently suspicious sir robert peel when announcing the repeal of the corn laws in the house of commons in  brilliantly warned 
i trust the government  will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests  let us trust that our example with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted  let therefore our commerce be as free as our institutions let us proclaim commerce free and nation after nation will follow our example this repeal of the corn laws was the result of an intense political effort especially by cobden and the anticorn law league who made the case for unilateral free trade cobden in his later years explained 
we came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles the better for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of england that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the freetraders  to take away this pretense we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became freetraders or not but we should abolish protection for our own selves and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best some will argue that the uk soon departed from unilateral free trade with the cobdenchevalier treaty of  which cobden himself supported and negotiated it is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict after orsinis attempt to murder napoléon iii in  the emperor was convinced by this same orsini to support the cause of italian independence this italian question brought england to the edge of war with france being strongly antimilitarists both cobden and chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade but as a way to establish friendship between france and england gladstone himself an ardent unilateralist in retrospect held that there were only two alternatives one of them the french treaty  the other war with france and cobden felt that the treaty was gods own method to produce an entente cordiale 
commercially the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats  as is the case today with trade treaties  but by two prominent free traders as cobden was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties he proceeded very carefully cobden wrote in a letter to the great british free trader john bright i will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of free trade nonetheless bright remained a skeptic and remarked 
governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people and why should that of louis napoleon be an exception the more i see of the rulers of the world the less of wisdom or greatness do i find necessary for the government of mankind to convince cobden of the benefits brought about by a treaty michel chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that bright asked for could constitute the british side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations thus avoiding a clear violation of british unilateralism 
free trade with or without you 
the unilateral free trade program is very simple the british parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs to avoid a race in nontariff barriers the parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the eu norms and regulations can be sold freely in the uk this should not be a problem since the uk still is a member of the eu by parliaments act most of the nontariff barrier problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization if the eu legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables so be it but although eu producers will be free to sell their product in the uk the british legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way 
the advantages of this approach are many first the uk can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations no need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with 
the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta for example between the eu and canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations negotiations about ceta were started in october  and finished in august  but for the treaty to be effective each eu member state still has to ratify it worse in some european federal member states the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated states this is why wallonia recently vetoed ceta thus threatening the work of a sixyearlong negotiation in the case of the uk  and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade  the british economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade 
the second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to brussels you are signifying to the eu apparatus that with or without you we will have free trade at this point the eu will have no leverage left with the uk the negotiation of a trade treaty on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the  eu member states but also because the eu has a vested interest in making sure brexit fails eurocrats starting from the contestable assumption that the uk has much more to lose than the eu will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow anglosaxon neighbors 
free trade first negotiations later 
still it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally the eu will decide to restrict the access of british corporations to the single market this is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the eu member states the concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it it will remove any leverage the british government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners without a treaty commercial partners it is thought will soon erect protectionist barriers 
unilateral free trade however does not mean the uk producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond first by declaring unilateral free trade the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the eu to antagonize a good client would be foolish lets not forget that this past decade british exports to the eu grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world at the same time the uk is a major consumer of eu products and its balance of commerce with the eu was negative by about  billion in  
but how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a selfdefeating strategy sir robert peel whom we mentioned earlier said in  that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty because he hoped that they might employ these duties as instruments of negotiation with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country such a strategy was selfdefeating tariffs in view of a negotiation by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the british market were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade peel finally admitted in  during a debate in the house of commons i am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap whether other countries will buy cheap or no 
there certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade partners to keep their markets open indeed the british government can make it clear that if the eu unfairly penalizes british interests in some sectors eg finance then the british government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes imagine that the eu wants to damage britains car manufacturers then the british government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers corporate taxes  even to zero in an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today the uk would have good chances of prevailing over the eu interests 
perhaps the eu will consider making trading conditions with the uk harder but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultraattractive market just next door in the short run unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges in the long run unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot genuine free trade",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/b2611eb9-601f-42b8-92ff-125799a26b65.jpg,conspiracy,clinton inc watch pains msm report clinton corruption,hillary indicted election trump responds fbi investigation clinton scrambles following fbi announcement new email evidence infowarscom october comments alex jones breaks fbis friday announcement reopening investigation hillary clintons private email server new evidence surfaces new data reportedly uncovered separate investigation anthony weiner husband clinton ally huma abedin fbi director james comey cited recent developments bureaus decision letter committees lawmakers today previous congressional testimony referred fact federal bureau investigation fbi completed investigation former secretary clintons personal email server due recent developments writing supplement previous testimony comey wrote connection unrelated case fbi learned existence emails appear pertinent investigation writing inform investigative team briefed yesterday agreed fbi take appropriate investigative steps designed allow investigators review emails determine whether contain classified information well assess importance investigation new revelations could undoubtedly spell trouble clinton trump vowed fully investigate actions upon winning election newsletter sign get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles,1,
Mikael Thalen,2016-10-29T00:54:59.074+03:00,the email that got john podesta hacked,"image credits flickr n  
the following excerpt is adapted from mendenhalls review of deirdre mccloskeys book bourgeois equality the original review which appeared in the quarterly journal of austrian economics is available here 
if its true that wayne booth inspired deirdre mccloskeys interest in the study of rhetoric then its also true  happily in my view  that mccloskey has refused to mimic booths programmatic formulaic methods and boorish insistence on prosaic succinctness bourgeois equality is mccloskeys third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with the bourgeois virtues  and bourgeois dignity  each published by the university of chicago press this latest volume is a big book alike in kind but not in theme to jacques barzuns from dawn to decadence  camille paglias sexual personae  or herald bermans law and revolution  and law and revolution ii  its meandering and personal blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls montaigne or emerson 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
writing with an air of confidence mccloskey submits contra thomas piketty that ideas and ideology  not capital accumulation or material resources  have caused widespread economic development since  worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated the quality of life in poor countries has risen  even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food goods services medicine and healthcare that in earlier centuries were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe the transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus the rhetoricalethical change involved peoples attitudes toward other humans p xxiii namely the recognition of shared experience and sympathy as adam smith stated in the theory of moral sentiments attributing human progress to ideas enables mccloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement eg class mobility and fluidity while generating extensive prosperity thus her project is at once scholarly and tendentious a study of the conditions and principles that in turn she promotes 
she argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas  such as human equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem p xxix  that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics not matter mainly but ideas caused the great enrichment p  in other words the original and sustaining causes of the modern world  were ethical not material and they included the new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them p xxxi this thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive mccloskey has a habit of reminding readersin case you missed her point the first second or fiftyseventh time aroundthat the causes of the industrial revolution and the great enrichment were ideas not narrowly economic or political or legal changes p  she maintains to this end that the scottish enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equalitynot equality of outcomes of course but of opportunity and treatment under the law and the scottish model to her mind stands in contradistinction to the french example of centralized topdown codification command planning and design 
a perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history the clerisy which is an appendage of the bourgeoisie p  and often dubbed the elite in regular parlance mccloskey calls the clerisy the sons of bourgeois fathers p xvii and neoaristocratic p  the clerisy includes those artists intellectuals journalists professionals and bureaucrats who resent the commercial and bettering bourgeoisie p xvi the clerisy seeks in different ways at different times to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive illiberal irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers early on says mccloskey referring to the period in europe after the revolutionary year  the clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading and so require expert protection and supervision p  the clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority 
because the clerisy is shapeshifting assuming various forms from time to time and place to place its a tough concept to pin down the word clerisy does not appear in the books index to permit further scrutiny by contrast mccloskeys general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions 
in a massive tour de force such as this readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims historians will find mccloskeys summaries to be too breezy even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys my complaints are few but severe for instance mccloskey is i believe either careless or mistaken to announce that during the nineteenth and early twentieth century under the influence of a version of science in a territory thats never specifically identified the right seized upon social darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people and to elevate the nations mission above the mere individual person recommending for example colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war p xviii 
lets hope that its innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd unqualified categorical assertion adam cohens imbeciles  and thomas c leonards illiberal reformers  describe how in the united states social darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily though not exclusively by the left not the right these recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject thomas m shapiros population control politics  philip r reillys the surgical solution  joel braslows mental ills and bodily cures  wendy klines building a better race  stefan kuhls the nazi connection  nancy ordovers american eugenics  christine rosens preaching eugenics  christina cogdells eugenic design  gregory michael dorrs segregations science  paul a lombardos edition a century of eugenics in america  and alexander minna sterns eugenic nation  these represent only a small sampling 
is mccloskey unware of these texts probably not she reviewed leonards book for reason although she did so after her own book reached press at any rate would she have us believe that emma goldman george bernard shaw eugene debs marie stopes margaret sanger john maynard keynes lester ward and w e b du bois were eugenicist agitators for the political right if so she should supply her definition of right since it would go against commonly accepted meanings on the matter of colonialism and war selfidentified members of the old right such as albert jay nock john flynn and senator robert taft advocated precisely the opposite of what mccloskey characterizes as right these men opposed among other things military interventionism and adventurism the trouble is that mccloskeys muddying of the signifiers left and right comes so early in the bookin the exordium that readers may lose trust in her question her credibility and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters 
other undefined terms only make matters worse ensuring that mccloskey will alienate many academics who as a class are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises she throws around the term romanticism as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested a conservative and romantic vision p xviii science fiction and horror fiction are  offshoots of romanticism p  jane austen is not a romantic novelist  because she does not take art as a model for life and does not elevate the artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism or worship of the middle ages or adopt any of the other antibourgeois themes of novalis franz brentano sir walter scott and later romantics p  romanticism around  revived talk of hope and faith and a love for art or nature or the revolution as a necessary transcendent in peoples lives p  romantic candor p  the late eighteenthcentury romantic literary critics in england had no idea what john milton was on about sic because they had set aside the rigorously calvinist theology that structured his poetry p  the nationalist tradition of romantic writing of history p  romantic  hostilities to  democratic rhetoric p  in the eighteenth century  the idea of autonomy triumphed at any rate among the progressive clerisy and then became a leading romantic idea á la victor hugo p  and the romantic conservative thomas carlyle p  
to allege that the clerisy was thrilled by the romantic radicalism of books like mein kampf or what is to be done p xviii is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of say keats or coleridge or wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of hitler and lenin mccloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing german idealism or contextualizing hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition her loose language will leave some experts i do not profess to be one scratching or shaking their heads and more problematic some nonexperts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity one imagines the overeager and wellmeaning undergraduate having read bourgeois equality setting out to demonize william blake or destroy the reputation of percy shelly about whom paul cantor has written judiciously wouldnt originality imagination creativity and individualismwidely accepted markers of romanticismappeal to mccloskey yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of romanticismwhich she portrays as a fixed monolithic selfevident thingundermines aspects of that fluctuating movement period style culture and attitude that are or seem to be consistent with her weltanschauung 
but i protest too much these complaints should not diminish what mccloskey has accomplished would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures communities and eras mccloskey takes the long view as we all should her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if given the technological advances we have made the work we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree changing minds and less and less about implementation by hand p  equally significant is her embrace of humanomicsdefined as the story of a complete human being with her ethics and language and upbringing p xxwhich materializes in casual references to henrik ibsens plays challenges to the depiction of john milton as a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens p  analyses of jane austens novels and portrayals of elizabethan england her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment with all of its troubles and possibilities 
best of all her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action let us then she says at one point not reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the french enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the german romantic movement fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy as rational optimists let us celebrate the great enrichment and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it p  at another point she encourages her audience to guard against both cynicism and utopianism p  and elsewhere to heed tradetested cooperation competition and conservation in the right mix p  these little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors as it were and demonstrate that she is not attemptingas is the academic wontto hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities 
poverty is relative and hence permanent and ineradicable despite mccloskeys claim that we can end poverty p  if tomorrow we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfoldeven fiftyfoldthere would still be people at the bottom the quality of life at the bottom however would be vastly improved the current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries mccloskey is right we should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments hence we should welcome and produce more books like mccloskeys that undertake a rhetoricalethical revaluation to both examine and celebrate a society of open inquiry one which not only depends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom p  in mccloskeys approach economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive rather they are mutually illuminating and in fact indispensably and inextricably tied an economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace all economics is at its core humanomics we could do without the latter term if we understood the former newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and

Allen Mendenhall,2016-10-29T02:08:58.551+03:00,ideas make us rich," competing theories on why the fbi reopened the hillary email server investigation the fbi normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation american thinker   
there is no question that reopening the fbi investigation into hillary clintons email server is a big deal the fbi normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation nbc reports 
the fbi is reviewing a new batch of hillary clinton emails bureau director james comey said in a letter to the senate judiciary committee on friday 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he wrote 
the very first thing to note is that comey made no mention of a grand jury the emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation if that is the case further subpoenas are quite possible a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date 
there are  competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind he might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the fbi is substantial three days ago american thinker published an open letter from a retired fbi agent hugh galyean that laid out some of the damage comey has inflicted on the institution he leads there is little doubt that this reached many in the fbi family putting in print what people have only whispered about if those silenced voices start speaking out comey could face a serious loss of face in this scenario he is heading off a staff rebellion possibly including mass resignations rush limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory that by announcing an fbi investigation resuming comey is putting a lid on further attention to wikileaks i guess this means that clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete after the election before speaking about what the evil russians are planting into our politics it is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election in this scenario comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed and that he would be held accountable after it comes out this scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis involving the possible indictment of a presidentelect before an election or the evidence being turned over to the house of representatives for impeachment hearings 
well know more in the coming days and i am sure there are other possible theories and motives it is shame that we have to speculate and that the oncerespected fbi director is now subject to analysis of his political gamesmanship newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/29522773515_a74189ad4e_k.jpg,conspiracy,world community fears hillary kill list,votes switched multiple states clinton electronic voting machines switching votes across country owen shroyer infowarscom reports multiple states vote donald trump switched hillary clinton reported infowars friday woman hollywood maryland came forward week claim ballot switched hillary clinton tried vote donald trump get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles download mobile device free today show get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew store featured videos featured videos victim hillary chicago violence speaks see rest alex jones youtube channel trump responds new fbi investigation hillary see rest alex jones youtube channel illustration much healthcare premiums rise infowarscom free speech systems llc company rights reserved digital millennium copyright act notice flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce,1,

Steve Watson,2016-10-29T13:10:16.575+03:00,competing theories on why the fbi reopened the hillary email server investigation,"eight ways to strengthen our democracy beyond voting the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections by chuck collins   chuck collins 
throughout this trying election season weve been told how much is at stake with our vote but the success of any democracy depends on continuing to pay attention long after we cast our ballots 
so lets pledge to strengthen our democracy with a few resolutions to focus our intentions and keep us moving forward over the next four years 
 change your media diet  
way too much ink airtime and mental real estate has been consumed by the horserace reporting on electionsits all about whos winning and losing so unplug from the talk shows that interview pollsters and engage in partisan bickering all day find the commentators and independent media outlets that strengthen our civic life 
 turn off corporate media 
this election has been very profitable for big media corporations but bad for our democracy as cbs chairman les moonves remarked  man who would have expected the ride were all having right now the moneys rolling in and this is fun 
our differences have been compounded by media reports that amplify the loudest and most partisan utterances election coverage this year has encouraged us to view one another as cartoon caricatures not neighbors 
 reject the consumer mentality in elections  
were encouraged to view national elections like consumers buying a car but presidential elections can make most of us feel like spectators not participants election day is a small part of our real democracythink of voting as a tiny fraction of your civic life 
 make your voice heard  
pledge to communicate with your elected officials all year round not just when they want your vote call write email and attend community forums when a politician hears from a dozen constituents with the same concern it matters 
a few resolutions must address our polarized political atmosphere the only way to break through this is by connecting with people we dont always agree with 
for instance the liberal california sociologist arlie hochschild spent five years interviewing conservative tea party activists in louisiana making friends and asking deep questions she urges us all to scale the empathy wall and learn each others stories 
heres a few easy ways to get started 
try a social media fast 
social media is amazing but it mostly serves as an echo chamber to reinforce our existing views its not a substitute for talking to people asking questions and learning why people support certain policies 
 practice the art of civil discourse  
find ways to meet others facetoface to engage in conversations not soapbox speeches and debates look at the  living room conversation  movement that brings people together across political divisions their goal is to encourage authentic respectful conversations to strengthen relationships and advance understanding of the challenges opportunities and solutions before us 
finally other resolutions should focus on changing our polarizing election system 
 eliminate the wealth primary  
long before voters cast their ballots in a primary big money donors have winnowed the field and selected who will stand for election people all across the political spectrum agree that we need fundamental campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of big money including the repeal of citizens united  
 break the twoparty duopoly  
a growing number of voters have declared independence from the two major parties so why do we allow other voices and perspectives to be excluded from presidential debates our democracy would benefit if we had real choices outside the two major parties as they do in most other countries in the world 
the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections and especially after the deeply toxic experience of  we all need to step up to protect our real democracy from those who profit from division

Steve Watson,2016-10-29T13:10:17.353+03:00,audio emerges of hillary clinton proposing rigging palestine election,"share this 
there are so many reasons americans should not vote for hillary clinton but one of those reasons is this womans tyrannical plans to strip us of our second amendment rights what many people do not realize is that if she becomes president hillary would ban many of our favorite guns as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked 
in a recent wikileaks dump we got an inside glimpse into hillarys diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president if you thought obamas tyranny with bypassing congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious it wont hold a candle to this womans plans she blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner more aggressive than obama while chipping away at our second amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws 
while hillary likes to pump us full of crap claiming that lawabiding americans wouldnt be targeted with her tyranny her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect americans with no criminal records while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals 
one example is hillary calling for the reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on highcapacity magazines however the result of her assault weapons ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms including the popular ar while making high capacity magazines illegal to even possess 
we all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because hillary decides to pass a law 
her other constitutionsubverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for victims of gun violence to sue gun manufacturers which would quickly bankrupt these companies however hillarys ultimate goal is to ban all guns in america completely by utilizing the supreme court with her handpicked justice filling antonin scalias vacancy she would have the scotus revisit the district of columbia v heller  ruling if successful the court would eliminate its previous affirmation that it is an individuals constitutional right to keep and bear arms 
when you put all the pieces together hillarys plans for america is nothing short of chilling history taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed  images of corpses from nazi concentration camps come to mind add hillarys gungrabbing plan to her dream of turning america into a borderless society and flooding our country with muslim refugees and you have the perfect recipe for disaster

Mikael Thalen,2016-10-29T13:10:20.545+03:00,votes being switched in multiple states to clinton,"california becomes second state to raise legal smoking age to  
  ethan a huff staff writer tags smoking age  california  prohibition naturalnews if youre between the ages of  and  live in california and are a smoker expect to be denied your favorite pack at the convenience store beginning in june the new minimum age for officially jumped from  to  a prohibition move that lawmakers claim will curb the number of smokers in the golden state and ultimately help save livesjoining both hawaii and the city of needham in massachusetts california is the third locale in the us to raise the legal smoking age to  officials there hope that like in these other places age restrictions on smoking will help reduce the number of smokers and minimize the number of individuals who develop smokingrelated health conditions like emphysema and lung cancerciting statistics from needham that show a nearly  percent reduction in the number of smokers in the fiveyear period following the change that was made in  april roeseler head of the california public health departments tobacco control program told the los angeles times that she expects similar reductions in her statein needham the number of high schoolers smoking cigarettes fell by nearly half according to a study published last year and adult smoking rates in the town also fell from about  percent to a mere  percent  statistics that experts say can be replicated all across the countryif we can push that age up where fewer and fewer people start smoking as a teen its likely that we will start to have some tobaccofree generations  the times quotes her as saying prohibition never works people who want contraband will find a way at this point though very little if any evidence exists to show that the rule change is working as intended university of california san francisco ucsf professor dr stanton glantz for instance admitted to the times that the policy still needs time to settle in the california smokers helpline also says it hasnt noticed any increases in the number of callers in the prohibited age range trying to quit which suggests that not much has changedtheres also the contraband factor  older kids still buying cigarettes for younger kids for example including those younger than the former threshold age of  illegal buying has always been an issue law or no law which is something that the government never really seems to understand when it comes to issues of prohibition theyre hanging out and partying together so theyll just get someone else to buy says leonard charles the owner of a liquor store in oakland charles says he strictly enforces the new cigarette age law but believes that if somebody wants cigarettes he or she is going to find a way regardless of the lawin the internet age cigarettes are also freely available to anybody with a wifi connection people can order cigarettes off the web and have them delivered right to their doorstep which means that statelevel restrictions are basically mootand what about ecigarettes the state of california classifies ecigs as a tobacco product just like cigarettes and they are subject to the same laws however everybody has them these days theyre very discreet and they dont produce that typical tobacco smell thats so hard to get out of a room  so trying to enforce restrictions against their use is next to impossible say experts familiar with the reality of how easy it is to obtain tobacco regardless of what the law sayswhen asked how the new law will realistically work in light of the fact that smoking laws often arent effective glantz responded the short answer is i dont know sources for this

  daniel barker tags parental obesity  children  health risks naturalnews the growing number of babies born to obese mothers throughout the world face a higher risk of developing serious health problems in adulthood according to several recent studies children of obese mothers are prone to brain damage heart disease stroke and asthma in adulthood warn health expertsobese parents pass on the tendency towards obesity to their children creating a vicious cycle that warrants urgent action on the part of health officials said the researchers of the new studiesthe list of health risks is surprisingly long including diseases like cancer and conditions such as adhd and autism from the guardian four studies published in the lancet diabetes and endocrinology make clear that the risks of maternal obesity include stillbirth dangerously high blood pressure in pregnant women diabetes in the mother or child and complications during childbirththe scale of obesity in women of childbearing age and the consequent dangers to health were so great that urgent action was needed to ensure women were a normal weight before they conceived the authors saymothers being very heavily overweight could lead to their children having autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or developing cancer in later life the researchers saybetween  and  in the united states  nearly a third of women at peak childbearing age  to  were obese and  percent of american mothers were either overweight or obese at the time they conceivedin britain where obesity rates among women are the highest in europe  percent of mothers were already obese when they became pregnant in   percent of women in england between the ages of  and  were obese as were  percent of  to yearolds global obesity has reached pandemic proportions obesity has reached pandemic proportions globally and its origins start in the womb said professor lesley regan the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologistsregan pointed to the fact that more than  percent of men and women in the uk are obese and that the one in five pregnant women who are obese face an increased risk of miscarriage stillbirth and neonatal death as well as gestational diabetes blood clots preeclampsia more complicated labours and severe bleeding after the birththe researchers involved in the studies are concerned that the global obesity problem will only worsen particularly in the developing world it is estimated that more than  percent of women throughout the world will be dangerously overweight by one research paper warned of longterm profound public health implications while another called for governments to begin treating obesity as a global public health prioritythere is increasing evidence indicating that obesity during pregnancy can lead to a child being predisposed not only to developing diseases like type  diabetes and asthma but also neurodevelopmental disorders like cerebral palsythe complex interaction of neuroendocrine metabolic immune and inflammatory factors in obese women are believed to affect hormonal exposure and nutrient supply to fetuses leading to possible brain damage in unborn children searching for solutions in a world dominated by fast food and sedentary lifestyles the experts all agree that something should be done but there are no simple solutions increased education and guidance may be part of the answer but a number of aspects of modern daytoday life are increasing the tendency towards becoming obeseamong these are an increasingly commercialised food supply ie junk food reliance on cars and public transport dangerous and overpopulated urban environments and the tendency to sit in front of tv and computer screens for unhealthy periods of timeultimately it is the responsibility of parents to lose weight before giving birth to children and to set a healthy example for children as they grow and develop but in a world of fast food and smartphones this may not prove to be so easily accomplished sources",english,legorafi.fr,No Image URL,satire,live soirée présidentielle us le gorafi,meet journalist facing years jail filming

that companies are beginning to realize that consumers want options no one wants to be forced to buy gmo productsit is easy to want to applaud nestle for their decision to continue to expand their line of nongmo products however it is also clear that this company is doing so out of their own financial interests  not because they care about what people are eating organic gmofree foods are the

what they found was horrifyingthe study which was conducted by public health england and cancer research uk found that the average day mortality rate across england was about  percent for lung cancer and  percent for breast cancer but in some hospitals those numbers were much higher for example at lancashire teaching hospitals the  day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was  percent in milton keynes the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to  percentthe research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several areas including blackpool coventry derby south tyneside surrey and sussexthe data also revealed that about in people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at cambridge university hospitals died because of chemotherapy treatmentof course the industry was quick to defend their practices with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data problems noting that even a few deaths could skew statisticshowever no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin it doesnt discriminate it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells  and therein lies the rub it may kill the cancer but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the futurea  study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survivors year survival rates the research which was led by scientists from the department of radiation oncology at the northern sydney cancer centre of the royal north shore hospital located in sydney australia raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and adjuvant chemotherapieswhat they found was that in australia chemo only contributed  percent to the year survival rate in adults and in the us that number dropped to  percent these findings suggest that overall chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patients survival in their conclusion the study authors wrote as the year relative survival rate for cancer in australia is now over  it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival to justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy a rigorous evaluation of the costeffectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently requiredthe amrc urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary after all unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine  sources",english,legorafi.fr,No Image

politicians are telling trump to knock off such talk but as usual trumps shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum  in which the opposition party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of democratic pressure  is winning the daynone other than billionaire investor and longtime democratic supporter george soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election in favor of clinton  no matter how much of the popular vote and from which battleground states trump capturesas reported by top right news and other outlets during a recent interview with bloomberg news  soros  a democrat megadonor  openly admitted that trump will win the popular vote in a landslidehowever he said that none of that would matter because a president hillary clinton is already a done dealin the interview which is now going viral soros says with certainty that trump will take the popular vote despite what the polls say now which are completely rigged to oversample democrats  but not the electoral college which will go to clintonwhen the reporter asks if that is already a done deal  that clinton will be our next president no matter what  soros says yes and nods his headis soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence or does he truly know something most of us dont knowin a recent column  natural news founder and editor mike adams the health ranger says that soros and democrats have bribed electoral college representatives in a bid to fix the election outcome in favor of clinton in truth that would be the only way it could be done short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting as some reports have already claimed adams further pointed out that soros was one of the main money men behind the black lives matter movement which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country  some of which has led to the deaths of several officers alreadysoros also funds leftwing websites and groups that locate pay and deploy volunteer agitators at trump rallies to start fights and engage in physical violence against trump supporters acts that the establishment media then blames on trump but arent electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that electors district no theyre not ninenine percent of electors have done what theyre supposed to do throughout our history but this is no ordinary election per archivesgov  there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote rather these pledges fall into two categories state law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political partiesin the past the us supreme court has ruled that the constitution doesnt require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and therefore respective political parties may extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties nominees archivesgov notes some state laws hold that faithless electors could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot and could then be replaced by a substitute electorthe supreme court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the constitution no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged said archivesgovthe site notes that throughout our history  percent of electors have voted as required but this is no ordinary time and its no ordinary election  and democrats and the establishment media have already proven that they will do anything to stop a trump presidency plus establishment republicans dont want trump either so you can bet they wouldnt balk at or challenge the

patients are even worse off part of the problem is that hospitals in most states can legally charge whatever they want for medical services because they know that a bulk of their patients insurance

hospital costs are still prohibitively and unnecessarily expensive in many cases  especially for patients who dont have insurance and who thus have nobody to advocate on their behalf for fairer

thursday october   by isabelle z tags stds  infection rates  disease pandemics naturalnews the news keeps getting worse for a nation that is already known for embracing unhealthy habits as the cdc reveals that the us saw more reported cases of sexually transmitted diseases stds last year than in any year in the countrys historyaccording to the cdcs annual report the nations three most common stds  gonorrhea chlamydia and syphilis  rose between  and  to reach an alltime highthe number of primary and secondary syphilis cases that were reported increased by an alarming  percent while gonorrhea rose by  percent and cases of chlamydia climbed by  percent while all three of these diseases can be cured by antibiotics the cdc says that most of these infections end up going undiagnosed and therefore untreatedmore than  million new cases of chlamydia were reported last year and two thirds of these were young people aged between  and  this disease can harm a womans reproductive system and if left untreated can adversely affect her fertilitymeanwhile  new cases of gonorrhea were reported last year this number might be lower than that of chlamydia but this std is particularly concerning as its becoming increasingly difficult to treat this summer cdc scientists warned that the bacteria responsible for gonorrhea is developing resistance to the antibiotics that are normally used to treat itsyphilis cases which noted the biggest rise of the three main stds numbered  last year with men who have sex with other men making up the majority of the new cases syphilis can have devastating effects including blindness stroke and stillbirth there has also been a surge in newborns being born with syphilis after being infected by their mothers concerning lack of testing the director of the cdcs division of std prevention dr gail bolan expressed concern that americans are simply not getting the preventive services that they need she believes that every pregnant woman needs to be routinely tested for syphilis and bisexual and gay men who are sexually active should also get annual testsdr jonathan mermin director of the cdcs national center for hivaids viral hepatitis std and tb prevention pointed out that half of all stds are occurring in young people under the age of  part of the problem among young people could be the mistaken belief that the better hiv treatment that is now available means condoms arent necessarywhile socalled hookup apps have been shouldering a lot of blame for facilitating casual sex experts believe that the surge in stds is largely down to budget cuts to std prevention and care programs at the local and state levels more than half of such programs have been subjected to budget cuts in recent years with a number of health departments closing std clinics altogetherdr bolan pointed out that more than  percent of health departments have reduced their clinic hours screening and tracing of people who might have been infected with stds this means people could be living with stds for a longer period during which time they could potentially transmit them to even more people these diseases all tend to have no obvious symptoms in their early stages which means testing is vital to prevent their spread the cdc reports that the economic burden this is causing the american healthcare system is almost  billion per year

thursday october   by isabelle z tags reheating  toxic food  foodborne illness naturalnews nothing beats a homecooked meal not only does food taste better when you prepare it yourself but its also a lot healthier unfortunately this can also be very timeconsuming depending on the dish in question and todays hectic lifestyle means that a lot of us cant cook something special from scratch every day if you dont want your family to have to resort to toxic fast food on your busy days what can you domaking enough homecooked food to last a few days sounds like a great idea on the surface because you can quickly microwave it but the truth is that reheating certain foods can actually make you and your family quite ill  here is a look at some of the foods that you need to be really careful about reheating rice according to the nhs eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning they explain that the reheating itself is not the culprit it actually has to do with how the rice was stored prior to reheating rice can sometimes contain spores of bacteria known as bacillus cereus  which can cause food poisoning and these spores can survive cooking if rice is then left to sit at room temperature the spores can grow into bacteria which will multiply and could produce toxins that can cause vomiting and diarrheathe nhs says that the likelihood of this happening increases with the amount of time the rice sat outside at room temperature they advise serving rice right away after it has been cooked or else cooling it as quickly as possible  within no more than an hour they also suggest reheating rice to the point where it is steaming and avoiding storing it in the refrigerator for longer than one day potatoes potatoes that have sat out at room temperature for several hours can not only lose their nutritional value but they could also create the perfect conditions for botulism to grow uneaten potatoes should go directly to the fridge after cooking to help reduce the chances of this occurring chicken when you reheat cold chicken the structure of its proteins is changed which can cause digestive upset if you have leftovers you cant bear to toss reheat them slowly at a lower temperature on the stove or in the oven to help keep the chickens proteins intact it must be steaming all the way through before you can serve it so be sure to stir it every once in a while spinach spinach is best eaten raw but its okay to cook it if you plan to eat all of it immediately afterward however when cooked spinach is reheated the nitrates in it break down into nitrites turning one of the healthiest foods into something that is potentially toxic and can negatively impact the uptake of oxygen in the blood eggs it is not a good idea to repeatedly expose eggs to heat reheating them after theyve been fried or boiled using high temperatures can cause them to become toxic and upset your digestive tract moreover their protein is destroyed when they are repeatedly exposed to heat according to the fda  cooked egg dishes should never be left outside of the fridge for more than two hours this drops to just one hour if the temperature is higher than  degrees f warm temperatures between  and  degrees provide the perfect environment for bacteria to growwhile most of us have reheated these foods and have not noticed any adverse effects it is important to exercise caution if you plan to continue doing so in order to avoid poisoning yourself and your family or causing digestive issues tina hanes of the usda meat and poultry hotline suggests making sure your leftovers reach  degrees fahrenheit when you reheat them and you should use a food thermometer to verify this covering the food helps it retain moisture and boosts its chances of heating all the way through which is vital for avoiding cooler pockets where bacteria can thrive finally keep in mind that microwaves are particularly risky because they do not heat food evenly sources include",english,legorafi.fr,No

breathing  a process that goes almost unnoticed and happens on such a deep subconscious level yet it is vital for our being nowadays there are more and more cases of people breathing incorrectly 
living in a big city surrounded by constant stress pollution and technology can sometimes bring the body out of sync with the natures flow young children know how to breathe correctly on an intuitive level their body follows the rhythm of nature 
with time as the stress increases and obstacles come into our lives we quickly forget our calm manner of breathing and switch to a frantic one instead without even realizing it cancer prevention 
in  dr otto warburg received a nobel prize when he proved that cancer cells are anaerobic  this means that they cannot survive in high levels of oxygen when a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar a normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation cardiovascular health 
hypertension is all too common quite often as a result of stress in order to lower the blood pressure its important to decrease the stress levels  one of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep slow breathing not only does it calm your heart beat but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace 
research was conducted over a  year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan  as well as increase general health the framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath and the lifespan of that person an increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan cure for depression 
brain needs oxygen to work just like any other organ in the body stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result one of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke this is an extreme example but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions symptoms such brain fog forgetfulness lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected increased energy levels 
have you ever told someone youre tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise this is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration  when you inhale the air correctly more of it gets to your body thus increasing the energy levels through conversion it is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles different breathing techniques 
there is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure improve sleep help with anxiety and much more 
yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called pranayama as an essential part of the process coming from the east its uncertain when exactly yoga originated but there is evidence that it has been around for at least  years  yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years making them timeproof i will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that i personally use in different situations best body detoxifier 
kapalbhati is a breathing technique that detoxifies your body opens up your nasal passages and allows your mind to concentrate after doing the exercise you will feel a rush of energy that will immediately wake you up

its a simple slow breathing  exercise that helps you fall asleep faster or calm down during an anxiety attack all you have to do is fully exhale through your mouth with a sound whoosh with a closed mouth slowly inhale with your nose on a count of four hold your breath for seven seconds exhale fully through your mouth on a count of eight  making a whoosh sound repeat until you feel sleepy or calm",english,legorafi.fr,No Image URL,satire,la corée du nord annonce avoir envoyé un missile balistique de félicitation à donald trump le gorafi,cups carrots roughly chopped tbsp fresh lemon juice tsp fresh ginger peeled cup ice cubes directions add ingredients blend enjoy health benefits drinking carrot juice prevents cancer eating antioxidantrich foods helps fighting free radicals thereby preventing possibilities development cancerous cells studies reveal carrots juice great sources vitamin vitamin c vitamin b collectively help fight free radicals protects brain health carrots carrot juice benefits brain health helping prevent alzheimers disease improving memory defending types cognitive decline due carrots ability lower oxidative stress brain weaken nerve signaling capacity increases metabolism phosphorous carrot juice boosts bodys metabolic rate ensures optimal use energy body decreases pain workout carrot juice contains large amount vitamin b complex helps breaking glucose fat protein helps building muscle increasing metabolism thus helping weight loss cleanses liver carrot juice cleanse detoxifies liver regular consumption tasty juice help releasing toxins liver bloodstream cannot rid body toxins bile kidneys ejected skin carrot juice aids process ensures harmful bile removed body prevents aging betacarotenoid carrots instantly turns vitamin enters body therefore drinking carrot juice help reducing cell degeneration also slow aging process control cholesterol blood sugar carrot juice works like miracle maintaining cholesterol blood sugar levels thanks potassium content low calories sugar content essential vitamins minerals present collectively work prevent diabetes treats macular degeneration drinking carrot juice regularly help elderly people avoid risks macular degeneration carrots rich betacarotene splits via enzymatic reaction leads formation provitamin strengthens bones vitamin k present carrot juice contributes protein building process body aside also supports binding calcium result faster healing especially broken bones sources,1,

sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease when it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry we need to take them with a grain of salt 
researchers at the university of california san francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the s revealing that the srf sugar research foundation now known as the sugar association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar 
at the time heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease the biased research focused everyones attention on fat 
ucsfs finding published in jama internal medicine shows researchers at leading universities including harvard were paid by the srf in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease in the process sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored singing the praises of lowfat foods 
as a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications life in the second half of the th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines 
warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant eating fat especially the saturated variety was equivalent to clogging your arteries even eating an egg containing  grams of the forbidden macronutrient was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week 
lowfat diets became the craze in fact lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options 
yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded to add flavour to lowfat foods sugar was the usual substitute and the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer it contributes not only to obesity and diabetes but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease cvd a time for change 
recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously and falsely attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis 
jama internal medicine has published a study by a team of ucsf researchers showing that sugar aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease in this study the diets of  children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein fat complex carbohydrates and total caloric intake the results showed beneficial effects on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure 
another study undertaken by researchers from saint lukes mid america heart institute and albert einstein college of medicine and published in progress in cardiovascular diseases showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in ldl bad cholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides while lowering hdl good cholesterol 
the new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines from governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity 
the us dietary guidelines for  to  recommend that added sugars make up less than  percent of a persons daily calorie consumption while the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet the guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of cvd in adults 
the american heart association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease it recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of  teaspoons and  teaspoons for women and men respectively how can something sweet be so bad 
according to one cardiologist dr stephen sinatra sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin high levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings an inflammatory response ensues causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged in this way the stage is set for heart disease 
add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes which raises the risk of heart disease and the overall danger is compounded addictive properties exacerbate the problem 
it seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did this notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar like nicotine is an addictive substance 
in medical circles addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine 
when our bodies digest sugar they release dopamine and opioids these neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit so what do we do now 
we need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods including foods 
food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item 
every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than  percent of its total calories from added sugars 
widespread education regarding sugars toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors offices 
everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction

  daniel barker tags antigmo  crop circles  our little rebellion naturalnews an american company has hit on a novel way to promote its nongmo corn snacks while raising awareness concerning the dominance of gm agriculture in the country  by using crop circles as an advertising mediumour little rebellion  a company that sells a line of nongmo corn snack products called popcorners  has joined up with nebraska farmer jim mcgowan to create a giant message in his cornfield urging people to join the corn revolutionthe acre crop artwork also features a largescale version of the popcorners website address and the logo of the nongmo project an organization that verifies our little rebellions productscourtney pineau associate director of the nongmo project saidits super creative  were really excited about it ive never really seen a brand undertake an endeavor like this so thats one of the things that we really loved about itthe project involved some hightech gps mapping a crop circle artist and a week of handcutting corn by a team of  peoplea drone camera captured the creation of the artwork as seen in the video belowfifthgeneration farmer mcgowan saidwere really excited to be able to see the whole circle here come into effect most of the time in production agriculture its treated as a regular raw commodity and you dont even know what happens to it to see the actual chain complete with this product from that field is really specialfrom eco salon the project seeks to draw attention to the baffling  percent of american corn acreage currently being grown with genetically modified seeds  and to our little rebellions efforts to source the  million pounds of corn it uses annually from the other eight percent meeting a growing demand for nongmo foods to manufacture its products our little rebellion has had to take a creative approach partnering with dozens of small farmers like mcgowan to restructure supply chains so that they can obtain enough nongmo corn to keep production steadythe nongmo project says that the growing demand for nongmo corn soybean and canola is encouraging more farmers to plant nongmo cropsdespite massive lobbying and propaganda campaigns on the part of the gm agriculture industry americans have consistently spoken out in favor of gmo labeling and the right to have a choice between purchasing gmo and nongmo foodsthere is a market for natural organic gmofree foods  and those who are willing to put the time and effort into developing these products and the supply chains to support them are likely to be rewarded in the long run gmo industry lies exposed public now facing the truth public awareness of the issues surrounding gmos is growing more people than ever now realize that the industry has failed to live up to its promise to feed a hungry worldgmo crop yields are not bigger the gm agricultural model hurts small farmers and poisons the planet with glyphosate and gm crosscontamination and the development of herbicideresistant superweeds are threatening the entire agricultural spectrum  and the public is finding out about itthe gmo deception is no longer sustainable just as gm crops are not a part of a truly sustainable agricultural system the sooner food producers realize that and begin giving the public what it wants  ie healthy organicallyraised  sustainable food products  the more chance they will have to survive and thrive in an evolving and highly competitive marketplacesmaller companies like our little rebellion and established food giants like dannon which recently made a pledge towards gmolabeling transparency and introducing nongmo products are likely to benefit over the long haul for having joined the nongmo rebellion early onthe demand for healthy food is real and the market will eventually be forced to meet that demand sources",english,legorafi.fr,No Image URL,satire,trop essoufflé après avoir cherché ses affaires de sports dans toute la maison il renonce à

  vicki batts tags eminent domain  dakota access pipeline  civil liberties naturalnews there have been countless stories across the web that have documented those struggling to fight against the dakota access pipeline native americans farmers ranchers landowners and environmental activists have joined together to oppose the pipeline and bring the project to a grinding haltjust recently  native american activists were arrested at a construction site near the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota despite the corporate medias attempts to suppress information surrounding the controversial pipeline concerns about the dakota access project have become increasingly visiblehowever one issue has remained in the dark the governments abuse of eminent domaineminent domain is what gives the government the right to seize private lawabiding citizens properties for public use normally this means a road a school or another public structure that will be used by the citizens of a town or which in some way serves them however the government can also seize private land if they can prove that it will provide some sort of public good this loophole  and yes it is a loophole  has allowed our government to steal land from taxpayers for years and then give it to a private citizen or company such is the case with the dakota access pipelinethis pipeline is not a public project it is being conducted by a private company that will profit off their endeavors and yet in spite of all the land that will be destroyed and the people whose lives will be disrupted by this project the government has still seen fit to steal land and give it to the pipelines creators under the guise of public goodin iowa a major conflict between farmers and the government has broken out you see the state government is trying to take their land and consequently their livelihoods to make way for the pipeline the states decision to hand over land owned by farmers to the dakota access llc has been

  vicki batts tags scary movies  immune system  weight loss naturalnews who doesnt love a good horror flick right there may actually be some health benefits to be found in watching scary movies too experts say that when you watch something frightening it engages your fight or flight response this in turn raises the amount of adrenaline pumping through your veins which can be pretty good for your bodypsychologist mark griffiths a professor of behavioral addiction at nottingham trent university says that there are a number of reasons why people typically seek out fearinducing films while the desire to experience something unusual isnt totally health related griffiths also commented on the potential healthy release some people may experience watching such films may also be cathartic providing an emotional release for pentup frustrations he told the uks daily mail but there could be more to it than just that at least according to some new research evidence indicates that the fear you experience while watching a scary movie could help to temporarily bolster your immune system scientists from coventry university took blood samples from a group of test subjects before during and after they either watched a scary movie or spent time in a quiet room their findings which were published in the journal stress  revealed that white blood cell counts were increased in those who saw the horror film  normally white blood cells respond in this way when there is a sign of infectionaccording to natalie riddell an immunologist at university college london this is all part of our evolutionary process which has been geared to promote the survival of the individual getting scared can engage the fight or flight response which in turn causes the release of adrenalinethe surge of adrenaline then launches the immune system into action  leading to an increased white blood cell countthats not all adrenaline can do either the survival hormone also elevates your heart rate and boosts your metabolic rate  the speed at which your body burns calories you may think that the number of calories you could burn by watching horror movies is negligible but studies have shown that you can actually burn a surprising amount of energy just by being scared thats right watching horror movies could help support your weight loss effortsin  researchers from the university of westminster conducted an experiment to see how many calories volunteers could burn off while watching  classic scary films on average each film scared the participants into torching about  calories  which is equivalent to walking for about  minutes the researchers found that the best horror movie for burning calories was none other than a classic steven king film thats right when people watched the shining directed by stanley kubrick they burned away a whopping  caloriesthe classic films jaws and the exorcist came in second and third place respectively for total calorie burning dr richard mackenzie senior lecturer and specialist in cell metabolism and physiology at the university commented that each of the  films sent hearts beating and pulses racing he explained as the pulse quickens and blood pumps around the body faster the body experiences a surge in adrenaline it is this release of fastacting adrenaline produced during short bursts of intense stress or in this case brought on by fear which is known to lower the appetite increase the basal metabolic rate and ultimately burn a higher level of caloriesoverall calorie burning increased by about onethird while the study

  daniel barker tags children  screen time  limits naturalnews in an effort to steer away from its previous onesizefitsall policy the american association of pediatrics aap has issued a new set of guidelines regarding how much time children should spend in front of television and computer screensuntil now the aap had recommended no more than two hours of screen time for children  regardless of their age the type of content viewed or which medium was being usedrecognizing that such a blanket approach could not effectively address the issues at hand the aap has recently taken steps to broaden its policiesfrom gizmodocomin a series of papers published today in the science journal pediatrics its clear that the aap has significantly revised its thinking on the matter breaking down media use according to all these criteria and to support parents with these new recommendations the aap has published an interactive online tool that families can use to create a personalized family media use plan aaps new screen time guidelines the new recommendations are aimed at the unique circumstances of various age groups for example the aap recommends that children under  months should avoid screens altogether except for limited occasions such as social media sessions with grandparentschildren between the ages of  and  months may be introduced to digital media but the content should be highquality programming and watched together with parentskids between the ages of  and  should be limited to one hour of highquality programming which also should be watched in the presence of parentsparents should impose consistent limits on the time spent in front of a screen by children  and older especially for entertainment purposes children should not be allowed to sleep with their smartphones tablets etc and should have one mediafree hour before bedtimemediafree times such as during meals should be established and mediafree zones in the household should be definedmaking sure kids get an hour of daily exercise and enough sleep at night is also part of the equation according to the aap parenting in the digital age aint easy as logical as these recommendations may sound implementing them may not always be easy most parents know that limiting their kids online time isnt always easy and many would be forced to admit that digital media can be a helpful tool in managing children parents obviously want to raise healthy children who arent constantly glued to computer screens but these devices are a godsend for those moments when a parent needs to make dinner or when they simply need to go to the bathroom when it comes to limiting screen time  theres a tradeoff between parental health and the needs of a childand that needs to be acknowledgedlets face it smartphones play a big part in our childrens lives now for better or for worse there is also an age when a parent can no longer police a childs online activity without invading his or her privacythe best thing a parent can do is to set consistent rules for younger childrens screen time and to try to help them learn to use the technology without becoming hopelessly addicted to itone way to accomplish that is by setting an example how much time do you spend in front of a tv computer or smartphone screen yourself in the presence of your childrenmany adults are as hopelessly addicted to digital media as their teens or children are if you expect a child to limit their time online you must be willing to do the sameyou might even try doing something completely out of the ordinary like

  by vicki batts tags weight lifting  dementia  brain health naturalnews there are many reasons to partake in strength training weightbaring exercises are known for their health benefits but could lifting weights also boost your brain recent research indicates that may just be the caseto begin the study researchers asked a group of people aged  to  to engage in a mix of weight lifting and brain training exercises all of the people who partook in the study had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment which is a precursor to alzheimers disease  and is an early sign of dementiawhile this particular study did not examine whether the benefits of exercise could be extended to the general population the results were quite impressive published in the journal of the american geriatrics society  the study found that weightbaring exercises could indeed provide some brain benefits the researchers found a casual relationship between an increase in muscle strength and an increase in brain function on that basis the team recommended that more people begin a strength training regime so that the worlds aging population can hopefully be a little healthier it is currently projected that about  million people will have dementia by the year the same team behind this most recent research also published a paper in  that revealed that weight training provided cognitive benefits to just about every area of the brain  something cognitive training failed to dowhile discussing their most recent data one of the studys researchers dr yorgi mavros of sydney university commented what we found in this followup study is that the improvement in cognition function was related to their muscle strength gains the stronger people became the greater the benefit for their brainfor the strength training study participants were asked to lift weights that were equivalent to about  percent of their maximum capacity twice a week for six months  similar to the way in which many athletes train and as the participants got stronger the amount of weight they lifted went up as well in order to maintain the desired  percent of their maximum effortbrain scans revealed that certain regions of the brain actually increased in size for those who took part in the exercise regime dr mavros says that the benefits were profound enough to warrant recommending weight training for everyonethe more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting  the more likely we are to have a healthier ageing population he told the independent  dr mavros also added that the best way to ensure that you get the most benefit from exercise is by maintaining a regular routine exercising frequently and with some intensity is key to getting the most out of what youre doingthis new research is not the first to suggest that exercise can provide benefits to brain health  the body of research linking physical exercise to better cognitive function has only continued to grow over the last several years science has indicated that in addition to better mental health exercise can also promote both better memory and concentrationdr james pickett head of research at the alzheimers society also had a few things to say about this new study he noted new research is beginning to unravel how physical exercise may have benefits for the brain as people get older this study suggests that people with minor memory and thinking problems known as mild cognitive impairment may benefit from weight training to improve their brain healthpickett also noted that while it is not yet clear if exercise can reverse dementia they do know that it is one of the most important factors in its prevention along with being active he says that not smoking and eating a healthy balanced diet are all

food waste and hunger are enormous global environmental and public health problems as overwhelming as these issues are community groups volunteers local businesses and organizations are working on trying to find a solution 
what started as a social action project in  a few members of a small community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste 
and theyre succeeding 
the project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than  volunteer drivers a network of more than  donors and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis 
amazingly the entire group has rescued more than  million pounds of food  enough to provide  million meals heres more of this motivating againstallodds story food waste and hunger 
about a third of the planets food goes to waste thats enough to feed two billion people 
the united nations environment programme unep and the world resources institute wri report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around  trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems 
furthermore the natural resources defense council nrdc cites the following 
forty percent of the food in the united states is never eaten but at the same time one in eight americans struggles to put enough food on the table 
nearly  million people worldwide suffer from hunger  but according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations we squander enough food  globally  trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over 
in developing nations much of the food is lost after harvest because of the lack of refrigeration good roads and adequate storage facilities on the other hand developed nations waste more food when retailers order display or serve too much 
additionally consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires more alarming statistics of wasted food 
much of the wasted food in the us ends up in landfills the us environmental protection agency epa reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the united states 
and it accounts for about  percent of the waste stream thats more than  million tons of food waste that the us sends to the landfills each year 
additionally according to nrdc on average people dining out leave  percent of meals uneaten and  percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home 
in spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers in metroatlanta georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need people are fed perishable food not wasted 
more than ten years ago a few members of a community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste they wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need 
since the first delivery was made in  the group has rescued more than  million pounds of food and the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than  million meals 
as success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called second helpings atlanta  now second helpings atlanta has  donors  partner agencies and a team of more than  volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day 
executive director joe labriola says the challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it and thats what we do we play a very specific role we do  scheduled pickups and deliveries a week weve gotten pretty good at this fresh food versus nonperishable 
fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income one of second helpings atlantas goals is to change that standard offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits 
this year the group has delivered  pounds of food and labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than  million pounds by the end of the year 
the reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in 
according to labriola he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere he adds that  percent of the food produced in the us is never consumed and the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is  
twenty percent of people in georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next its a pretty grim story labriola says but if we rescue just  percent of that food we can feed  million americans how its working 
when people sign up to volunteer theyre shown the available routes then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule 
most pickups are regularly scheduled however the group often gets calls from people holding weddings bar mitzvahs or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night then a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food 
volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year except christmas food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan that way volunteering is within the reach of everyone 
from the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than  minutes for he or she to return home families volunteer 
quite often entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste 
for example around thanksgiving a family with two young children met labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store the children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck and into the agency that would distribute them to families labriola told the kids they just helped feed  families the children soon realized what they did one of the children said thats as many kids that are in my school

one of the major reasons why lots of people choose organic foods is to avoid exposure to chemicals however most of these organic foods such as beans  often come in packaging which if not done well there are lots of chemicals present that can greatly interfere with the normal physiology especially if there is a wrong choice of packaging company 
various types of food packaging can possibly leach compounds into your food investigate your packaging kitchen and youll observe a lot of materials to be concerned about regardless of the possibility that youre for the most part a real food type of individual you presumably have canned merchandise oats pastas and granola bars packaged in plastic bags plastic wrap and plastic storage in your washroom 
most by far of food and refreshment cans which seem by all accounts to be made of metals like steel and aluminum in reality are lined with bpa bps or deplorable substitutes like polyvinyl chloride pvc which contains the known cancercausing agent vinyl chloride your canned soup soda significantly seltzer or juices are likely exposing you to bpa and different compounds youre in an ideal situation not ingesting 
even packaging made of evidently amiable paper might be lined with chemicals of concern like pfass which can be found in pizza boxes and the wrapping of slick takeout food extra chemicals from flame retardants to bpa have worked their way into our paper packaging as laudable efforts to recycle paper have presented a variety of different contaminants 
the environmental working group ewg has added yet another database to its arsenal of chemical data for consumers permitting the individuals who need to avoid exposure to toxins to check for bpa in their food packaging they built up the database since they contend that consumers have a right to recognize whats in their food  particularly with regards to an ingredient for example bpa that has been linked to cancer infertility mind nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities diabetes obesity and different genuine disorders theres no simple route for your average consumer to discover what their food is stuffed in and little research demonstrating the amount of these chemicals migrate into our food 
a wholefood unpackaged eating regimen is your best safeguard against the chemicals in packaging also it is very important to check the reputation of the packaging company and if they are positively or negatively rated since there are such a large number of unknowns with regards to packaging your most solid option is to avoid it when conceivable proper packaging is can go a long way in ensuring that you retain the health of your body 
one of the key things in making the packaging safe is by entrusting a packaging company that knows the importance of eliminating all chemicals in the food stuffs there are packaging companies that are more careful when dealing with food packaging your foods wrongly and without proper care can not only pose a risk in your health but it can ruin your name as the packaging company below are some of the ways that you can drastically reduce the harm that may arise during the food packaging at the point when conceivable avoid canned foods and beverages plastic wrap and plastic bottles instead pick a glass when you can and cook beans yourself but if you must buy look out for the reputable packaging companies accomplish your very own greater amount food preservation to lessen your exposure to packaging chemicals have a go at dehydrating some of your gardens harvest and storing it in glass containers avoid putting hot food in plastic storage containers or heating foods packaged in plastic in the microwave plastics are significantly more inclined to leach chemicals when heated experts recommend keeping plastics out of the dishwasher too 
by following the above measures it can go a very long way in ensuring that you do not consume chemicals that are risky to your health

keywords fallout  nuclear  nuclear attack  nuclear attack survival  nuclear bomb  nuclear bomb survival  nuclear power  nuclear radiation  nuclear war  nuke  radiation  survival  tactical nuke with the ongoing tensions between the united states and russia fears of a nuclear world war  breaking out are running at an alltime high 
with that in mind i thought it needful to write an article on how to survive the aftermath of a nuclear fallout obviously we could discuss the likelihood of such an event occurring but that isnt within the scope of this article personally i believe that at this point in time such a scenario is not at all far fetched however the situation is very fluid and thus things could change at any time 
basically theres two main types of nuclear weapons out there first youve got what is known as the tactical nukes and then the intercontinental sort  the stuff that would basically flatten the earth in that case theres no point even trying to survive that im going to be talking about how to survive a tactical nuke incident  dont be anywhere near ground zero 
obviously the first step to surviving the initial explosion is to not be there in the first place of course theres not a ton that you can do if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time youve just got to hope that you exit this world pretty quick  which would most certainly happen if youre anywhere close to ground zero 
the tremendous heat and sheer force of the explosion is enough to kill anyone and flatten anything within an  km radius of the detonation site the intense thermal radiation emitted by the flash of light at detonation is enough to blind you burn your flesh and start fires in the impact zone 
if youre outside when this happens and you happen to survive you should take immediate cover in a building if you get any debris on you you should wash it off with soap and water as soon as possible 
as a survivor of the initial explosion you now have around  to  minutes to bail out of the area before a lethal amount of radiation fallout comes down from the mushroom cloud in those  minutes you need to get at least  km  mile from the blast zone to survive the fallout however within  hours lethal radiation will spread with prevailing winds so keep moving to safety you should feel for the wind and begin running perpendicular to it  not upwind or downwind  getting to shelter 
if you cant get out of ground zero for whatever reason then you need to get to shelter as soon as possible get into the deepest underground basement that you can find or the highest story above the th level if possible 
if you are in the fallout zone but safely sheltered you need to remain there for at least  days during this time food and water should be carefully rationed and clothing layered up to prevent radiation 
really the best way to survive a nuclear event is to prepare for one 
remember the nuclear fallout shelters of the cold war era well thats what you need to be inside to survive but not just any shelter its got to meet a number of different specifications which i am not going to go into because you can find plenty of information on that if you google how to build a nuclear fallout shelter etc  personal protection measures 
protecting your body from harmful radiation and fallout particles is your number one priority after getting to shelter 
like i said before being prepared prior to such an event is very important which is why its a good idea to carry the gear im going to talk about shortly inside a go bag that you can keep in your car house or workplace 
some quick first aid tips it is necessary that all wounds should be covered to prevent contamination and the entry of radioactive particles any burns caused by radiation must first be washed and then normal burn first aid procedure should be followed 
now lets look at the gear you should have ready before a nuclear attack happens 
gas mask youll need a gas mask to protect your face and respiratory system from airborne pathogens and chemical particles israeli military surplus m gas masks fitted with nato  mm cbrn filters are some of the best and cheapest around yet are getting harder and harder to find these days with huge supplies flying off the shelves in the relatively recent ebola scar i have the m civilian version of this gas mask and its extremely comfortable has a port for a hydration tube and best of all its been tested in real life conditions in the middle east 
military chemical suit these suits provide optimal protection from chemical and biological attacks and are used by the british army these are surprisingly cheap yet are proven to work by soldiers whose lives depend on them in everyday combat situations you can get these for around  from amazoncom 
gloves youre going to need gloves to protect your hands from contact with chemical pathogens and biological particles long chemical resistant gloves can be found online at some supermarkets and hardware stores you can get these at around    depending on the brand etc 
boots in order to have full protection from chemical and biological hazards it is important to have a good pair of rubber overboots to protect your feet and legs from chemical and biological particles from coming into contact with your body ensure that you blouse your trousers inside your boots for maximum protection once again these boots that i recommend are used by the uk military and you can get them on amazoncom for around  
nuclear protection there is a way to reduce the effects of nuclear radiation in your body its called potassium iodide and its available on amazon for less than  for a pack of  tablets what this basically does is it reduces the chances of harmful radioactive iodine from entering your thyroid glands 
if you dont have any of these when a nuclear attack happens you can improvise as i mentioned before clothing should be layered up to prevent radiation contact with the skin cover your eyes with closefitting sunglasses or improvised goggles 
 decontaminating food and water 
water and food will be contaminated by debris from the nuclear fallout making procurement and consumption difficult however it is not impossible to make them safe to consume 
whenever possible try to use water that has been sealed in a container or bottle as you can safely assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated wash the container thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least  minutes before breaking the seal if water in sealed containers is not available your next choice only under emergency conditions is water from springs again boil the water for at least  minutes before drinking keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contamination by airborne pathogens 
your last choice only in an extreme emergency where sealed water and spring water are unavailable is to use standing water that found in small pools ponds and basically any water that does not flow contaminants microorganisms and germs can survive easily in stagnant water first boil this water as long as practical to kill all organisms next filter it through a cloth to remove the nasties 
in all cases mentioned above use water purification tablets following all directions on the bottlepackaging after boiling and initial filtration prior to consumption 
like water you can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe to ensure safety decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for  minutes this is where it helps to have a decent supply of sealed buckets and containers of militarystyle mres and freezedried foods such as wise foods and mountain house 
you should consider supplementing your sealed rations with local plants animals and produce only in extreme emergencies unfortunately no matter what you do to prepare or decontaminate the food there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents 
remember you can survive for a long time without food at least  weeks but can be longer especially if the food you eat may potentially kill you 
if you must use local food select only healthylooking plants animals fruit and vegetables do not select known carriers of organisms such as rats or other vermin always use gloves and protective clothing when handling and dressing animals plants etc cook all plant and animal food by boiling only boil all food for at least  minutes to kill all pathogens do not try to fry bake or roast local food as there is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperature to kill all pathogens do not eat raw food at all costs

the himalayan salt lamps are made from natural himalayan crystal salt rock formed millions of years ago in the foothills of himalaya salt lamps are blocks of pure himalayan salt so they come from the same region of the world also known as the vitamins of the air they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans and serve as a perfect air ionizer how himalayan salt lamps work 
himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body the ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic therefore the himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet especially in an environment with high humidity as the bulb heats the salt lamp the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air the negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens molds and bacteria and neutralize the environment in the house improve blood flow 
particular studies have suggested that negative ions such as those emitted by himalayan salt lamps can accelerate blood flow this boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs purify air 
dust pollen cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use himalayan salt lamp on your room it acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after they attract water molecules in the air which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh clean air this is known as hygroscopy good vibrations 
salt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people you can use salt to clear crystals clear your body and clear your home because salt crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance boost energy levels 
positive ions deplete the body of energy and it is believed that himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite the negative ions increase energy levels which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature improve your breathing 
asthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted corrupted air salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs other benefits of using himalayan salt lamp

when i was a kid if i were told that id be writing a book about diet and nutrition when i was older i wouldve thought that whoever told me that was out of their mind 
living in newark new jersey my parents and i consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead rotting pig bodies although we did eat bacon as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean going through high school and college it was no different in fact my dietary change did not come until i was in my s 
just to put things in perspective after i graduated from weequahic high school and before going to seton hall university i had a parttime job working for a butcher i was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store needless to say i had no consciousness nor awareness as change never came then despite the horrors i witnessed on an almost daily basis 
after graduating with a degree in accounting from seton hall i eventually got married and moved to a town called livingston livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income to say it was a plastic community would be an understatement 
livingston and the shallowness finally got to me i told my wife i was fed up and wanted to move she made it clear she had to be near her friends and new york city i finally got my act together and split for colorado 
i was living with a lady in aspen at the end of  when one day she said  lets become vegetarians i have no idea what possessed me to say it but i said okay 
at that point i went to the freezer and took out about  worth of frozen dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us 
well everything was great for about a week or so and then the chick split with another guy 
so here i was a vegetarian for a couple weeks not really knowing what to do how to cook or basically how to prepare anything for about a month i was getting by on carrot sticks celery sticks and yogurt fortunately when i went vegan in  it was a simple and natural progression anyway as i walked around aspen town i noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called the little kitchen 
let me back up just a little bit it was april of  the snow was melting and the runoff of ajax mountain filled the streets full of kneedeep mud now aspen was great to ski in but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting 
i was ready to call it quits and i needed a warmer place ill elaborate on that in a minute 
but right now back to the little kitchen knowing that i was going to leave aspen and basically a new vegetarian i needed help so i cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook i told them in return i would wash dishes and empty their trash they then asked me what i did for a living and i told them i was an accountant 
the owner said to me lets make a deal you do our tax return and well feed you as well so for the next couple of weeks i was doing their tax return washing their dishes emptying the trash eating three squares a day and learning as much as i could 
but like i said the mud was getting to me so i picked up a travel book written by a guy named foder the name of the book was hawaii looking through the book i noticed that in lahaina on maui there was a little vegetarian restaurant called mr naturals i decided right then and there that i would go to lahaina and work at mr naturals to make a long story short thats exactly what happened 
so im working at mr naturals and learning everything i can about my new dietary lifestyle  it was great every afternoon we would close for lunch at about  pm and go to the sheraton hotel in kaanapali and play volleyball while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner 
since i was the new guy and didnt really know how to cook i never thought that i would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner well one afternoon thats exactly what happened it was my turn that posed a problem for me because i was at the point where i finally knew how to boil water 
i was desperate clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle fortunately there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and i asked him if he knew how to cook he said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas he said that his enchiladas were beanless and dairyless i told him that i had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about but i needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal 
well the guys came back from playing volleyball and im asked what was for dinner i told them enchiladas the owner wasnt thrilled i told him that mine were beanless and dairyless when he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible being the humble guy that i was i smiled and said you expected anything less it apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week in fact after about a week we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around lahaina broadcasting enchiladas at naturals tonight i never had to cook anything else 
a year later the restaurant closed and somehow i gravitated to a little health food store in wailuku i never told anyone i was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver 
the guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands i told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the state thats when they found out i was an accountant and down to earth was born down to earth became the largest natural food store chain in the islands and i was their chief financial officer and comanager of their biggest store for  years 
in  i started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures i still do that show today i pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty one bit of a hassle was the fact that i was forced to get a masters degree in nutrition to shut up all the mds that would call in asking for my credentials 
my doing this radio show enabled me through endless research to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries the big pharmaceutical companies the biotech industries and the government agencies 
this information unconscionable as it is enabled me to realize how broken our health system is 
i left down to earth in  got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie after doing that for about four years i finally made it back to honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the honolulu club one of hawaiis premier fitness clubs 
it was there i met the love of my life who i have been with since  she made me an offer i couldnt refuse she said if you want to be with me youve got to stop working on naked women so i went back into accounting and was the chief financial officer of a large construction company for many years 
going back to my newark days when i was an infant i had no idea what a chicken or egg or fish or pig or cow was my dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents it was by the grace of god that i was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness 
the road that i started walking down in  has finally led me to the point of writing my book a sane diet for an insane world hopefully the information contained therein will be enlightening motivating and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices 
doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow i am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities i have encountered along my path you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on not only for your health but your consciousness as well

saturday october   by j d heyes tags ammon bundy  oregon ranchers  court decision naturalnews in what freedom fighters across the country are calling a stunning victory against a tyrannical government agency a jury in oregon has acquitted all seven defendants involved in the armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in januarycheers broke out in the portland ore federal courtroom when the jury announced the acquittals of ammon bundy along with brother ryan bundy and five others the chicago tribune reported the seven were charged with conspiracy to impede federal workers from their jobs at the malheur national wildlife refuge which is located about  miles southeast of portland also the jury could not reach a verdict on even one count of theft for ryan bundy shocked by the acquittals the announcement by the jury did not come without additional drama however upon hearing the jurys decision marcus mumford one of ammon bundys attorneys demanded his client be released even shouting at the judge that prompted us marshals to tackle mumford to the ground and use a stun gun on him a number of times before arresting him the tribune reportedus district judge anna brown said she was not able to release bundy because he faces federal charges in nevada his home state related to an armed standoff with federal bureau of land management agents at his father cliven bundys ranch in  as reported by katu  the armed standoff began jan  and lasted nearly six weeks the incident brought new attention to the longrunning issue of too much federal ownership of lands in the american west the confrontations at the refuge earlier this year and on cliven bundys ranch in  essentially reignited arguments between private citizens  mostly ranchers  and the federal government that stem from the socalled sagebrush rebellion in the late s when western states like nevada attempted to wrestle more control of their own territory from the federal government as noted by the new york times the federal government owns nearly half of the land   percent  in the westthe tribune noted that even the defendants attorneys were shocked by the acquittalsits stunning said robert salisbury an attorney for defendant jeff banta its a stunning victory for the defense im speechlessthe us attorney in oregon  billy j williams said in a statement that his office stood by its decision to prosecute the seven defendantswe strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a court publicly tried and decided by a jury the statement said when the jury hears the story i expect the same result the oregon case was in a sense an extension the tense standoff between federal officials with the blm and other authorities and the bundys two years ago in nevada cliven ammon and ryan bundy are all scheduled to go on trial for that standoff early next yearits not clear what the outcome of the nevada trial will be federal attorneys have said they dont feel like the outcome in oregon will have any effect whatsoever on the nevada trialbut defense attorneys involved in the nevada trial arent so sure daniel hill an attorney for ammon bundy  says the oregon acquittal bodes well for his client and the other defendants all of whom are facing felony weapon conspiracy and other charges the tribune reportedwhen the jury hears the whole story he told the associated press  i expect the same result

nutritionist amanda hamiltonyoull get multiple benefits from the different herbs as well as creating lovely flavours teas for digestion everyone gets indigestion sometimes so it can be helpful to have a handful of herbal remedies on hand to provide fast relief according to caley her favorite herbs for gut upsets include chamomile cardamom ginger and peppermintchamomile functions as both an antispasmodic relaxing the gut and antiinflammatory thus providing broadspectrum digestive relief ginger is particularly good for nausea a benefit that has been proven in scientific studies peppermint is also an antispasmodic and is so effective that it is sometimes prescribed by doctors as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome cardamom pods should be crushed before steeping for relief of indigestion and flatulenceanother digestionpromoting herbal tea  not mentioned by caley is rooibos rooibos calms the digestive system perhaps due to its high content of the antiinflammatory quercetin

body and the mind as well caley particularly recommends it as a bedtime drink for anxious people as well as for children who tend to like its mildly sweet flavor she recommends skullcap for people who tend to be kept awake by a mind thats racinguse of valerian root as a sleep promoter has a long history in herbal medicine and the practice now has some scientific backing as well a  metaanalysis of  studies found that valerian root is an effective sleep promoter hypnotic with few side effects it is now sold overthecounter in norway as a sleep aidless well known are lime flowers which caley describes as very calming she notes that some of the volatile oils in lime flowers are believed to bind to the same receptors in the brain as pharmaceutical tranquilizers in the benzodiazepine familyanother remedy not mentioned by caley is the popular beer ingredient hops hops is known to promote sleep and to ease stress and anxiety other medicinal benefits of hops include easing

saturday october   by amy goodrich tags running  brain repair  longevity naturalnews we dont have to be scientists to know that exercise is good for us however researchers at the ottawa hospital and the university of ottawa in canada have added another item to the long list of potential health benefits of regular exercise they found that running triggers a particular molecule called vgf a nerve growth factor that can help repair brain and nerve damage in mice with an unusually small cerebellum and a shorter lifespan the cerebellum is the part of the brain important for balance and coordinationalthough more research will be needed to determine how the healing process would work in a human brain the canadian researchers are hopeful that their groundbreaking discovery may open new doors in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases put on those running shoes and extend your life in the study published in the scientific journal cell reports  the researchers reported that vgf production induced by running in a wheel extended the life of mice with smaller cerebellums and difficulties in walking typically these mice only lived for  to  days but when they were allowed to run they lived for over a year  which is the normal lifespan for a mousefurthermore they discovered that the running mice had a better sense of balance and showed increased levels of myelin production myelin plays a key role in a healthy brain  it is the insulating material of our nerves and is best compared to the plastic material around electrical cables lose that protective layer and nerves will have difficulty carrying their messages as quickly or efficiently resulting in a host of neurological issueswhile running improved the quality and quantity of life for the mice they had to maintain their healthy running habit once the opportunity to exercise was taken away they began to degenerate again and their lifespans shortened once more the positive effects of regular exercise dr picketts a senior scientist at the ottawa hospital and professor at the university of ottawa said that these findings shine a new light on the effect exercise might have on people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis ms that involve a loss of myelin or insulation of the nerve fiberswith multiple sclerosis you get a lot of degeneration of the neuron insulation and patients with ms go through these relapses and remissions picketts said were really hoping that maybe if we could use vgf to limit the number of degenerations it would really allow remissions to be more prevalent and longer he addedlast month another study published in the journal neurorehabilitation and neural repair  showed that exercise helped gerbils who had a stroke to recover their memory partly though myelin repair around the neuronshowever when dr picketts and his colleagues analyzed myelin levels in healthy mice running didnt seem to produce any significant change these findings suggest that vgftriggered myelin repair probably only kicks in when our brain or nerves are under attackgenerally healthy people already have normal levels of myelin noted dr matias alvarezsaavedra

saturday october   by isabelle z tags fast food  obesity  children naturalnews fast food chains know how to squeeze every last dollar out of their customers from decorating their establishments with appetitestimulating colors to pricing their meals to encourage people to get bigger sizes their every move is perfectly calculated to maximize profits unfortunately these practices are hurting a lot more than just your wallet  they are also affecting the health of your childrena study led by researchers from the nyu langone medical center found that children who ate at any of five fast food chains consumed an average of  more calories when their meals came with soda juice sweetened tea or flavored milk when compared to those who drank unsweetened beverages with their mealsthe researchers also discovered that the children consumed an average of  more drink calories when the drinks were part of bundled meals than when the drinks were bought separately moreover parents who bought a combo meal were  percent more likely to buy a highcalorie drink sweetened with sugarthe study looked at almost  children aged  and younger who ate food from mcdonalds kfc burger king subway or wendys in new york and new jersey between january  and june  seventyfour percent of the combo meals purchased were kids meals half of the drinks were sodas  and  percent of them were juice with flavored milk making up  percent a further  percent was made up of lemonade sweetened tea and hot chocolate nonsugary drinks proved to be quite unpopular with regular milk accounting for just  percent and water a measly  percentdr brian elbel of nyu langone the studys senior investigator said our study strongly suggests that uncoupling sugary drinks from combo meal deals might reduce highcalorie beverage consumption and help to curb childhood obesity rates fueled by these kinds of liquid calories parents need to take responsibility combo meals tend to appeal to big families which can find their bills quickly adding up at fast food restaurants wellmeaning parents who might not normally allow their children to drink sugary beverages sometimes find themselves giving in when the drink is includedalthough the practice on the part of fast food chains of bundling unhealthy foods together to create perceived value encourage unhealthy habits it is ultimately up to the parents to decide which meals to buy for their children parents have the final say and just because that supersized coke comes with your childs meal does not mean that you should let them drink it fast track to diabetes fast food meals are already high in calories which means that the last thing you should be doing is pairing them with highcalorie beverages research published in the journal diabetes care showed that drinking even just one sugary beverage each day raised a persons risk of developing type  diabetes by as much as  percent it also upped the risk of developing metabolic syndrome by  percentwith around  percent of our nations youth believed to be obese there is an urgent need for poor eating habits to be curbed until people start giving up the convenience of the local drivethrough and start making a concerted effort to feed their children clean food  the situation is only likely to get worse and more and more children will end up obese or diabeticso the next time youre thinking of ordering that combo meal keep in mind that any money that you might save on a meal deal is likely to end up costing far more in medical bills down the road sources include",english,legorafi.fr,No Image URL,bs,leaked hillary

saturday october   by natural news editors tags zika  mind control  propaganda naturalnews its been nearly nine months since the word zika flashed like a lightning bolt in the headlines of mainstream news before january   zika was just one of many viruses that public health officials monitored but suddenly in january of this year everything changed as a nearly harmless virus was transformed into a worldwide threatarticle by john p thomas republished from healthimpactnewscom as we will see the zika propaganda machine was turned on in october of  and it has been running wild ever since this is a classic example of a mind control program a public brainwashing project or a high powered marketing campaignregardless of what you call it it is clear that the mainstream news media the world health organization who the pan american health organization paho the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc big pharma big chem and both republicans and democrats have joined forces to sell a zika eradication program to the people of the united states and to the rest of the worldthis has been and continues to be one of the best orchestrated programs of propaganda in recent history this article will discuss how the program started how it has been developed and where it is going zika is not a threat to the babies of the world just to be absolutely clear from the beginning there is no solid evidence that zika is a threat to humanity it is a minimally dangerous viral infection which does not cause microcephalyin the almost  years since the zika virus was patented by the rockefeller foundation  no one ever noticed any association between zika infection of pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads or with defects in brain development but in  we were suddenly made aware of this supposed problem this claim based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence was the beginning point for the propaganda campaign a propaganda claim doesnt need to be true it just needs to be repeated over and over again until people believe it is trueafter half a year of fear and hysteria in the mainstream media even officials in brazil admit that zika is an unlikely cause of their microcephaly as reported in nature news  comment on july   an official from brazils ministry of health raises doubts to suggest zika is not the only factor in the reported microcephaly surge in his country the report stated zika virus has spread throughout brazil but extremely high rates of microcephaly have been reported only in the countrys northeast although evidence suggests that zika can cause microcephaly the clustering pattern hints that other environmental socioeconomic or biological factors could be at play we suspect that something more than zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases says fatima marinho director of information and health analysis at brazils ministry of health if that turns out to be true it could change researchers assessment of the risk that zika poses to pregnant women and their children  despite this admission from brazil the zika propaganda campaign is moving ahead without interruption the campaign will not be stopped by contrary evidence about zika and microcephaly zika is a mild viral infection most people who get zika will be completely unaware of being infected for those who do get sick it is similar in many ways to having a cold or a mild case of the flu people experience fever rash joint pain and conjunctivitis the illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week infection is thought to provide lifelong immunity severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon deaths are rare the fact that almost no one dies from zika infection made it a very unlikely candidate for the development of a vaccine for those who actually feel sick from a zika infection they can receive comfort care and rest while their immune systems overcome the viral illness zika press releases set the stage for a propaganda campaign however if zika could be connected to some other horrible consequence such as microcephaly or paralysis guillainbarre syndrome for example then people would insist that we create a zika vaccine and would insist that every person on planet earth take it they would be willing to give up basic individual freedoms for the benefit of society which is always the goal of mind control programsin  a number of press releases and reports were released by the pan american health organization  world health organization pahowho and the cdc to set the stage for the unfolding of a grand mind control projectthe documents they published raised the red flag of alarm that a zika epidemic was unfolding throughout south america and mexico the conventional media got excited about the epidemic when they saw the word microcephaly the prospect of large numbers of babies being born with abnormally small heads and brains was a story that would really grab the attention of their audiencethe media used pictures of deformed babies to build fear in the hearts of people and to create the perception that we better watch out or zika is going to get us and our babies they worked really hard to instill public panic about zika in january and february of  in the timeline that follows you will see the word autochthonous public health agencies use the word autochthonous to say that an infection was locally generated an autochthonous case of zika is one that was acquired in the local area where a person lives this is in contrast with a zika infection that was acquired while visiting another region or countryi will list a few of the key points from some press releases to show how a foundation for the zika campaign was built and how momentum was established to project the campaign into mainstream media may  brazil confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  columbia confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  brazil reports unusually high number of babies with microcephaly  november  el salvador guatemala mexico paraguay suriname and venezuela report autochthonous zika infection  november   who calls upon member states to watch for the occurrence of microcephaly  december   pahowho issued the first of dozens of reports which chronicled the history of the growing zika epidemic and warned of microcephaly   december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in honduras  december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in panama  december   us cdc reports autochthonous zika infections in puerto rico and makes note of microcephaly in brazil  counting babies with microcephaly the mainstream media suddenly picked up on the zikamicrocephaly story in january of  and began sensationalizing it general concern was quickly transformed into alarm as officials in brazil reported a steady increase in the number of microcephaly cases as of january   they reported  cases of microcephaly andor central nervous system cns malformation suggestive of congenital infection they compared this with    data where there was an average of  microcephaly cases the brazil data about the babies was poor we didnt know their definition of microcephaly we didnt know how many of the mothers actually tested positive for zika we didnt know how the data was collected we also didnt know why there was a strong level of insistence that the only thing that could cause these birth defects was infection with the zika virus propaganda campaigns always dismissed other viewpoints other than the one being promoted they dont want an investigation of truth or a debate about the facts  they just want belief and submission the us propaganda machine goes public in january  cdc officials begin to ponder the situation first they say there might be an association between zika and microcephaly but they are far from asserting any kind of causative relationship good for them i thought when i heard that report but their apparent wisdom took a nosedive a minute later when the same cdc official went on to issue a travel warning to women to avoid traveling to brazil and other south american countries if they are pregnant think they might be pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant in the next couple yearswhat did the cdc just say there is no evidence of causation and we dont even know there is even a problem but women should stay home any way strange i thought as i began to remember how the conventional media the cdc and the who hyped up the african ebola epidemic in a similar kind of propaganda campaign just  months earlier the worldwide threat of ebola zaire completely died out long before a vaccine could be developed which must have been a major disappointment to big pharmabut this time they have a virus that is not going to die out this time their propaganda campaign will be much more sophisticated and it will make major steps toward the acceptance of universal mandatory vaccination for diseases such as zika a false international crisis involving deformed babies justifies action all through january and early february of  the news media provided us with a nonstop litany of stories about zika and deformed babies in a previous article i examined some of the headlines in the propaganda campaignthe cdc was still using the word possible association while the news media insisted on using the word cause despite the initial reserve of the cdc the news media began to shout the message across america zika is going to deform the heads of our babies while they are in the womb and theres no vaccine to protect usit seems like every zika story i saw included at least one photo of a baby with microcephaly and always stated that there is no vaccine yet we were reminded over and over again that zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads mental retardation and blindness we were warned that some babies were dying at birth because of the severity of their brain deformation we were told that each baby born with microcephaly will cost ten million dollars or more in medical expenses during the childs life  these stories created ever increasing levels of apprehension and fear as they were intended to doas the mainstream media struggled to keep the fear level high and keep the story line flowing from week to week they began to focus in on government efforts to save us from zika it didnt take long for them to find people to interview who would ask the question they wanted asked what is the government going to do to protect our babies this question was asked over and over again even though there was no proof that zika infection and microcephaly were related the question was asked so many times by the media that no politician could dare to say i am not going to do anything because as far as we know zika doesnt cause microcephaly president obama responds to the question on february   president obama requested  billion dollars to study the situation and to develop a zika vaccine lets look at this more carefully we are going to spend  billion dollars to develop a vaccine for a virus that almost never kills anyone and has not been proven to cause birth defects  just to be safe or is something else going on hereperhaps the real story is that big pharma wants another cash cow vaccine and the zika threat has been promoted in such a way that people will insist that big pharma develop a zika vaccine for us suddenly big pharma companies will be able to put on their white hats and rescue all the babies of the world this would be such sweet deception if they could pull it off cdc declaration zika causes microcephaly the cdc announced in april of  that zika causes microcephaly this decision was based on a cdc analysis of available data they did not conduct comprehensive research they used a quacking duck kind of analysis if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck they couldnt tell if it had feathers like a duck or has a bill like a duck but they still insisted on calling it a duck named zika in doing this they ignored some of the most important criteria in their analysiscdc researchers stated the seventh of shepards criterion proof in an experimental system that the agent acts in an unaltered state is aimed at medications or chemical exposures and does not apply to infectious agents thus given shepards criteria as a framework criteria   and  have been satisfied  evidence that is considered sufficient to identify an agent as a teratogen  in other words they used a set of seven criteria to determine whether zika could be considered to be a cause of microcephaly they determined that the association between zika infection and microcephaly was causative for  of the  criteria they suggested that additional study was needed before  of the other criteria could be met they excluded the seventh criteria altogether because it examined whether medications or chemicals might have caused microcephalyi couldnt believe that they excluded the seventh criteria when it is clear that microcephaly is known to be caused by pesticide exposure and could just as easily be caused by vaccinations during pregnancy as it was likely to be caused by zika infectionthese cdc scientists were only looking for causation from infectious agents nothing else seemed to matter this exclusionary mindset was present since the very beginning of the zika propaganda campaignthey ignored the effect of the tdap vaccine given to pregnant women in brazil in  they ignored the side effects of medications they ignored the consumption of gmo food glyphosate and pyriproxyfen that were widely used in brazil they ignored chemical exposure from brazils large chemical manufacturing facilities they ignored alcohol and drug use they ignored the effects of extreme multigenerational nutritional deficiencies and extreme poverty they ignored the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes that were released in brazil they ignored exposure to rubella toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus they ignored the combined effects of all these factors as well as multigenerational modifications to the local gene pool from these potential causesi discussed these potential causes of microcephaly in my first article on zika published in january of there is one key point that i want to bring forward from the previous article concerning the number of babies born with microcephaly first we heard that there were some  cases of microcephaly in brazil after the initial shock and panic was produced we learned that further investigation showed that the number of confirmed cases was only the mainstream media also didnt mention that the number of babies born in the united states with microcephaly in a typical year is  when adjusting for population differences between the us and brazil we find that the rate of microcephaly in the us is actually  times higher than the rate in brazilin other words the us microcephaly incidence is much higher than brazil and our babies didnt get it from zika maybe our babies got it from the various potential causes i discussed in my previous articlei should also state that the researchers who put their names on this article are all employees of the cdc  i must question whether their analysis was truly objective and whether their findings were influenced by cdc ties to big pharma the zika vaccine is in the pipeline based on this single poor quality analysis its full speed ahead for developing a zika vaccine there are at least four companies plus the cdc working on a zika vaccine we are told that it will still take several years before a zika vaccine can be properly tested and made available in large quantities for the population of the worldzika vaccine trials have already begun and they are already recruiting volunteers in the us the us national institutes of health hopes to start phase ii trials of its vaccine in early   congress tries to protect our babies with zika funding now that the cdc has settled the zikamicrocephaly question it was time to get congress to fund the presidents request for a zika vaccine development program the house and the senate passed zika funding bills however they have different ideas of how much money should be spent and how the funds should be generated the funding process stalled at the end of june when the senate and house could not reconcile their differences congress went on a seven week summer vacation and 
wasnt available to try to resolve their differences this created a problem for the zika mind control campaign because it might mean there would be no new zika news to report during the summer keeping the propaganda campaign going by killing mosquitoes the mainstream media switched their focus from vaccine development to eradication of the aedes aegypti mosquito which is known to carry the zika virus if an infected mosquito bites a person then the person might develop the infection this is a fact that no one is disputing the great mosquito chase of  the cdc continues to count the number of zika cases in the us and puerto rico the numbers continue to rise through the spring and early summer they were looking for autochthonous cases of zika in the us but they could only find infected people who had traveled to zika infected countries or who had sex with people who traveled to those countriesfinally at the very end of july  people in the wynnewood section of miami florida were found to have zika even though they had not traveled to a zika infected country or had sex with a zika infected person public health officials at the state and federal level interpreted the presence of these cases to mean that zika must have been transmitted to these people by mosquito bites they ignored the possibility that the infected people might have been lying about their exposure for example having sexual contact with an infected person nevertheless officials concluded that they must implement a strong mosquito control program to prevent zika from spreading any furthernow that the zika epidemic was on us home soil the media had another fear inducing story to add to their propaganda campaign there are mosquitoes that are out to get you and our babies the governor of florida goes door to door to find more people with zika on august st the governor of florida contacted the us public health system and asked them to send a specially trained squad of federal public health agents to help with the zika emergency in miami these agents and florida officials went door to door in the wynwood neighborhood of miami and collected urine samples to identify additional cases of zika more cases were found but all were asymptomatic  the people didnt even know they were infected  problem  they cant find a zika infected mosquito  mosquitoes were tested for the presence of zika but all tests were negative officials dismiss the negative infection results by saying that finding a zika infected mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack  aerial mosquito spraying program initiated the governor of florida in conjunction with federal public health agents decided that they needed to do aerial spraying of pesticide even though the aedes aegypti mosquito wouldnt travel more than  feet from its birth place in the wynwood neighborhood where the autochthonous zika cases were located the officials decided to spray a ten square mile area just to be safe a spraying program that covers ten square miles would make a sensational story in the media it would be much more alarming than a story about a neighborhood aerial spray zone it also would expose many more people to a toxic pesticide more about that laterthe first aerial spraying took place on august    toxic pesticide used in aerial spraying causes microcephaly officials told the public not to worry about the pesticide that was being sprayed because it naled is harmless they pointed to epa reports which supported their claim they didnt mention that naled was banned in europe in  they didnt mention that officials in puerto rico recently refused to allow the spraying of naled over their citizens they didnt mention that naled kills many other types of insects and aquatic creatures in addition to mosquitoes  most importantly official didnt mention that naled and the chemicals that are created when it breaks down in the environment have the potential for causing human birth defects  could pesticide naled cause microcephaly and other life threatening diseases officials didnt mention that the pesticide that they were spraying over the densely populated minority neighborhood of wynwood  was particularly dangerous for babies in the wombthis is what the journal of pesticide reform has to say about naled like all organophosphates naled dibrom is toxic to the nervous system symptoms of exposure include headaches nausea and diarrhea naled is more toxic when exposure occurs by breathing contaminated air than through other kinds of exposure in laboratory tests naled exposure caused increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning naleds breakdown product dichlorvos another organophosphate insecticide interferes with prenatal brain development in laboratory animals exposure for just  days during pregnancy when the brain is growing quickly reduced brain size  percent dichlorvos also causes cancer according to the international agency for research on carcinogens in laboratory tests it caused leukemia and pancreatic cancer two independent studies have shown that children exposed to household nopest strips containing dichlorvos have a higher incidence of brain cancer than unexposed children  emphasis added naled exposure causes increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning these are some of the symptoms that are also found in children on the autism spectrumone of the most toxic break down products in naled is dichlorvos this chemical caused a  reduction in brain size in pregnant lab animals after  days of exposure another word for reduced brain size is microcephalyso the pesticide they are spraying could increase the rate of autism among children in the spray zone and could cause microcephaly to occur in the babies of pregnant womenquestion if there are babies born in miami with microcephaly in the next nine months or if the autism rate in the spray zone increases will we blame zika or naled i am sure that no one from the cdc or from a public health agency will ever point a finger at naled they will use the children to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that zika is to blame naled is also harmful to adults dr naresh kumar a professor of public health at the university of miami commented about the risks of using pesticides in aerial spraying his statement came from cbs miami all are a neurotoxin meaning it will directly affect our nervous system it will affect not only the pregnant woman  it is also equally for children who have asthma and airway disease because when you are spraying in the air these aerosols stay in the air for at least five days  the miami herald provided this advice to people in the pesticide spray zone they stated the agency epa says the insecticide poses no risk for the majority of people but those sensitive to chemicals may want to stay inside during spraying close windows and turn off window air conditioners fruits and vegetables should also be washed before eating and outdoor furniture and grills covered  so if you are concerned about being exposed to the chemicals they are spraying then you should stay inside for  days until the pesticide falls out of the air you should keep your windows closed and turn off window air conditioners i wonder how many people were able to follow this advice in the subtropical urban climate of miami in augustmind control programs always try to make life difficult for those who live outside the box of normality they want us to follow their instructions which in this case would be to just not worry about the spraying if you are concerned then you can take their ridiculous suggestions which wont really protect you from the spray does zika also cause guillainbarre syndrome apparently the cdc suspects that zika causes the paralytic syndrome called guillainbarre if you look at the data collection forms for monitoring zika in the us you will see another masterful stroke of mind control in the making they are counting cases of guillainbarre syndrome on the same form with cases of zika why would the cdc try to make this connection the cdc indicates on their guillainbarre syndrome page that they are not sure what causes this syndrome they do mention that there were some cases of guillainbarre syndrome associated with the swine flu vaccine in  but otherwise the condition is rare with unknown etiology if they can make a case for the zika virus being the cause of guillainbarre syndrome then they will shift attention away from the fact that many vaccines and pesticides have a harmful effect on the human nervous system and are able to produce this type of paralysisi anticipate seeing a guillainbarre syndrome research paper just like the one produced by the cdc on microcephaly their new paper will just substitute the phrase guillainbarre syndrome for the word microcephaly they will show through statistical smoke and mirrors that the zika virus is causative for guillainbarre syndrome as well as microcephalyif they can pull this off then the zika virus will be blamed for all cases of vaccine damage in which microcephaly or paralysis results if they can pull this off and i suspect they will then pesticide manufacturers will also be able to blame the zika virus for microcephaly neurological malformation and paralysis that results from the use of their products the zika virus will be the perfect scapegoat the list of birth defects being blamed on zika with no evidence is increasing propaganda campaigns always seek to worsen the devastating effects of whatever they want us to fear first we heard that zika causes microcephaly then we heard that it might also cause guillainbarre syndrome now we are hearing that zika causes a whole host of other birth defects some of which might not appear until months or even years after birththe new york times stated the images of babies with microcephaly published tuesday in the journal radiology also suggest a grim possibility because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms the result of another common symptom zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes muscles arent developing normally because they dont have the nerve impulses to move normally she dr levine said with such a vicious and unpredictable virus its key to realize that zika is more than microcephaly that theres a number of other abnormalities as theyve shown in this paper and its effects are going to be even more broad said dr spong whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be  babies born in zika epidemic areas including brazil and puerto rico its going to be essential to follow them to look at their development to look at their ability to learn to look at hearing problems balance problems behavior problems all those issues to make sure that we dont miss anyone  zika the new scapegoat for all childhood diseases can you tell where this is going it seems to me that they are planning to put together a catalog of major injuries that results from zika infectionit will include most if not all injuries that result from vaccines pesticides gmo food pharmaceutical drugs the highcarbohydrate lowfat standard american diet and anything else that might lead to a successful lawsuit against big pharma or big chem zika might just become the standard defense for suit against corporations it wasnt our product that harmed this little baby it was zika conclusion another government tool for the greater good to strip away freedoms it wont be long before the mainstream media will be showing us pictures of us babies from florida who were born with microcephaly the mainstream media will tug at our heartstrings and will remind us that this horror will soon become preventable when the zika vaccine is developedwe will hear about more and more connections between zika and other terrible health conditions experienced by children we will be told that all this suffering and all this expense will be avoided when all the mosquitoes are killed and everyone receives the zika vaccinemind control programs always talk about the greater good and how individuals must give up their individual freedoms their rights and even their preferences for the sake of the collective benefit zika will be one of the tools used by mind controllers and the ruling elite to move us toward mass vaccination and total government control over our

Prissy Holly,2016-10-26T21:21:57.313+03:00,leaked hillary would completely ban the most popular guns in america,"surgeons admit that mammography is outdated and harmful to women 
friday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags breast cancer  mammography  harming women naturalnews every year millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors but surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice  which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive itthe public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure found that mammography is neither effective nor safe after looking at data on more than  women between the ages of  and  who underwent the procedure on a routine basis researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy  resulting in their rapid demiseas published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews  the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good  because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer thus the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments and not at the forefront of womens medicineif we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by  and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at  it means that for every  women invited for screening throughout  years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and  healthy women  who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily the authors concluded group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good one year after this review was published a second one published in the new england journal of medicine nejm came to a similar conclusion a team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist a clinical epidemiologist a pharmacologist an oncologic surgeon a nurse scientist a lawyer and a health economist decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunkthey found that for every  women screened in the us over a year annual screening period beginning at age  one breast cancer death would be prevented while a shocking  to  women would have a false positive while  to  would undergo an unnecessary biopsy between three and  of these women the study found would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparentthis study out of switzerland corroborates another out of canada  the  canadian national breast screening study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination in other words the procedure is completely unnecessary and in many cases exceptionally harmful and on and on the list goes with data out of norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be us data spanning the course of nearly  years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization this represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt worki

sunday october   by j d heyes tags shrimp imports  chemical injections  food fraud naturalnews it seems that the more advanced human civilization becomes the less we learn about what is and isnt good for our bodies thats the only way to explain why many commercial food operations are so toxic and hazardous to our healththe uks daily mail is reporting on a commercial shrimp operation in vietnam where workers have been videotaped injecting them with disgusting gellike substances in order to make them appear bigger and fresher before they are sold and exportedthe video shows factory workers injecting tiger prawns shrimp in the head tail and midsection with a gel substance to make them heavier before they are soldvietnam is the largest source of imported shrimp for many countriesthe video footage was shot by a vietnamese television station earlier this year since surfacing it has gone viral online on social media sites like facebook with many people expressing disgust and outragethe substance is often used in food as a thickening agent in particular for icing but many people who have watched the video are labeling the vietnamese factory and its workers as shameless and dishonest in their attempt to make the shrimp appear bigger and more meaty in addition the practice makes one wonder what else is being done to shrimp or other food products not just in vietnam but throughout the region all local shrimp suppliers do this environmental protection organization greenpeace recently released a report titled dodgy prawns as an aid for importers of shrimp to find sources that are harvested without using slave labor methods that are destructive or harmful to ocean ecosystems or that utilize toxic chemicalsthe guide recommended shrimp harvested in and around australia but also ecologically certified black tiger prawns from vietnam the organization also warned against all imported vannamei which very often is sourced from vietnam because of concern about mangrove destruction pollution and the use of invasive species natural blaze  in reporting on the story  noted that workers at the vietnam shrimp preparation factory in question said they injected the shrimp there because all local shrimp suppliers do thisthe site noted further that the largest suppliers of shrimp products in vietnam import more than half of their raw materials for processing from other countries including china which has a welldeserved reputation for unclean unsanitary food productionin the us about  million pounds of shrimp  or about  percent of the amount of shrimp americans consume annually  comes from vietnam which in turn gets most of its shrimp from china where food regulation is a cruel joke added weight means additional profits natural blaze reported that after about  million worth of shrimp was imported into the us from china between january and october  the us food and drug administration issued an import alert in december of that year the alert warned importers of the presence of new animals drugs andor unsafe food additives in seafood originating in china and that included shrimpthe daily mail said that workers were injecting the shrimp with a substance

sunday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags superbugs  antibiotics abuse  big pharma naturalnews as new guidelines set forth by the us food and drug administration fda to curb antibiotic overuse and abuse on factory farms slowly come into effect the drug industry is apparently setting its greedy sights elsewhere  towards countries where restrictions on antibiotic use are looser or simply where anything goeslivestock are the single biggest consumers of antibiotic drugs in the us  not by choice of course but because farmers have long been sold a bill of goods by big pharma when it comes to using them to bulk up their cattle more quickly and get them to market as fast as possible its a common practice that generates a lot of money in the shortterm but a whole lot of problems in the longtermthe use of antibiotics on farms is arguably the biggest contributor to antibiotic resistance among humans where drugs that used to treat deadly bugs no longer do the result is the emergence of socalled superbugs that are capable of outsmarting even the most potent antibiotics a phenomenon thats killing people by the hundreds of thousandssome of the latest reports indicate that the superbug epidemic is claiming the lives of some  people annually all around the world and if nothing is done now to stop the drug industry from continuing to poison the well so to speak then this number is expected to balloon more than fold to  million lives lost by the year according to the world health organization who there are very few countries in the world with any sort of formidable

such purposes is disastrous for public health comparatively speaking only  people die from opiate overdoses globally which translates to  times more people dying from superbugs than from the most deadly pharmaceuticals on the marketantibiotics are also overused in the realm of human medicine with some onethird of all prescriptions according to the us centers for disease control and prevention

sunday october   by david gutierrez staff writer tags cancer prevention  onions  quercetin naturalnews a chemical naturally occurring in onions may be able to suppress the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and perhaps even initiate cancer cell death according to a study conducted by researchers from kumamoto university in japan and published in the journal scientific reports these particular anticancer effects come from a chemical called onionin a ona the study focused on the effects of ona on the most common form of ovarian cancer epithelial ovarian cancer eoc this type of cancer has a fiveyear survival rate of only  percent it is the th most common female cancer in the united states and the fifth most lethal form of cancer in women as many as  percent of eoc patients relapse after their first course of chemotherapy kills cancer cells suppresses tumor growth in a prior study the researchers found that ona suppressed the tumorpromoting activity of a type of white blood cells known as myeloid cellsin the new study researchers further examined cellbased models of eocs firstly they found that the introduction of ona caused eoc tumor growth to slow further examination showed that ona was inhibiting the tumorboosting activities of myeloidderived suppressor cells mdscs thereby confirming the findings of the prior studyprevious research has suggested that in the presence of cancer mdscs may function to suppress antitumor activity by the rest of the immune systemthe researchers also found that when combined with anticancer drugs ona boosted the ability of the drugs to block cancer proliferationwe found that ona reduced the extent of ovarian cancer cell proliferation induced by coculture with human macrophages the researchers wrote in addition we found that ona directly suppressed cancer cell proliferationthe researchers then performed an additional experiment giving mice with eoc oral treatment with ona and comparing them with a control group they found that the mice given ona lived longer and their tumors did not grow as aggressively no side effects were observed from the treatmentthe researchers concluded that with some additional testing ona could be used as an oral cancer treatmentona is considered useful for the additional treatment of patients with ovarian cancer owing to its suppression of the protumor activation of tumorassociated macrophages and direct cytotoxicity against cancer cells they wrotestudies have also linked onions to a lower risk of stomach and colorectal cancers the overlooked superfood scientists continue to uncover remarkable health benefits of the humble onion which is a staple food in every culture in which it is foundthe benefits of onions start simply with their nutrient profile these vegetables are highly nutrient dense delivering high levels of vitamins minerals and antioxidants with relatively few calories a single cup of chopped onions contains  percent or more of the daily

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",2016-10-27T11:36:20.197+03:00,tasmanian devil milk is capable of killing the most deadly superbugs,"why hydrogen peroxide should be in every home 
sunday october   by david gutierrez staff writer naturalnews inexpensive nontoxic versatile and potent hydrogen peroxide is a wonder product that belongs in every homehydrogen peroxide is widely known as a disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes but many people dont understand that it works simply by oxidizing microbes to death hydrogen peroxide is simply water with an extra oxygen atom attached in this unstable form the oxygen breaks off from the water and forms a free radical solution that is highly reactive but once it has reacted the only byproducts are nonreactive oxygen and water this is why when used properly hydrogen peroxide is so safehydrogen peroxide is so safe and effective that our own immune systems actually generate it as the first line of defense against microbes as diverse as bacteria viruses yeast and parasites in this context it also appears to act as an antiinflammatory natural remedies so how can you make hydrogen peroxide work for you unsurprisingly many of this products greatest uses are as natural cures or for some other healthpromoting function for example a nasal spray made from one tablespoon of  percent hydrogen peroxide in a cup of nonchlorinated water can be an effective treatment for sinus infections toothaches caused by minor infection can be treated with a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash the same mouthwash can also remove bad breathif you think youre coming down with a cold stave it off by placing a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in your ears each morninghydrogen peroxide is also a potent antifungal a  mix of hydrogen peroxide and water sprayed on the feet every night and allowed to dry is a good way to get rid of athletes foot and other fungal infections a similar but much more diluted cure can be used on plants suffering from fungus in this case dissolve half a cup of hydrogen peroxide in a gallon of water and spray on the affected plant replace your cosmetics you can also get lots of use from hydrogen peroxide around the home mixed with baking soda it makes a great toothpaste it can also be used to protect water that you expect to be standing for a while such as that in a humidifier or steamer  a pint of hydrogen peroxide mixed in will prevent microbial growth similarly you can use hydrogen peroxide as a toilet bowl cleaner let it sit for  minutes and then scrubwhen properly diluted hydrogen peroxide can detox your skin by stripping away harmful environmental toxins just mix  quarts of hydrogen peroxide into a full bathtub and soak for half an hour or moreother cosmetic uses of hydrogen peroxide include cleaning your contact lenses  it denatures proteins that build up on the lenses  or helping to remove ear wax buildup a few drops in the ears followed by a few drops of olive oil will cause earwax to break up and drain outhydrogen peroxide can also be used as a safer gentler alternative to bleach for lightening your hair household uses hydrogen peroxide isnt just for your body it can also be for your dogs hydrogen peroxide can induce rapid vomiting in dogs that have swallowed dangerous objects vomiting should only be induced upon a vets recommendation howeverfinally hydrogen peroxide can be great for your clothing use it instead of bleach to whiten your laundry more carefully applied it can take out organic stains by breaking apart the proteins causing the discoloration this is particularly effective with blooduse caution when applying hydrogen peroxide directly to clothing as it may bleach or discolor some fabrics but if you have a fresh organic stain you should be fine if you pour on just a small amount of hydrogen peroxide wait a few minutes it should foam and then rinse it off with cold water and soap sources for this article

Vicki Batts,2016-10-27T11:36:23.054+03:00,top doctors chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to give no benefit,"did you know that cinnamon can boost intelligence 
saturday october   by amy goodrich tags cinnamon  intelligence  parkinsons disease naturalnews cinnamon is one of the worlds most consumed spices for thousands of years it has been prized for its medicinal properties and sweet warming taste aside from sprinkling cinnamon on top of your lattes or adding magic to grandmas apple pie researchers have found that consuming this tasty household spice also might enhance learning skillsscientists at rush university medical center in chicago found that increased ingestion of cinnamon significantly improved the memory of poor learning mice recently their findings were published in the journal of neuroimmune pharmacology in an article entitled cinnamon converts poor learning mice to good learners implications for memory improvementthe study was supported by grants from the national institutes of health the us department of veterans affairs and the alzheimers association how cinnamon affects the brain for the study lead researcher kalipada pahan a neurology professor at rush university medical center and his team zoomed in on two key proteins gabra and creb located in the hippocampus region of the brain the hippocampus is a small part of the brain that generates organizes and stores memory previous research has shown that lower levels of creb and higher levels of gabra occur in the brain of poor learnersto see if ground cinnamon could improve the memory of slow learners the researchers took a group of mice and placed them in a maze with  holes the experiment was focused on watching the mice learn how to locate their target holewhen they tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding the researchers found that the mice determined to be poor learners had significantly improved their memory and learning skills they could find their target hole twice as fastpahan and his team explained that when cinnamon is ingested the body converts it into sodium benzoate a chemical compound used to treat brain damage furthermore they discovered that when benzoate entered the mices brains it increased creb decreased gabra and stimulated hippocampal neurons which led to improved memory and learning skillswe have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning pahan saidhowever no significant improvements were seen in the mice that were considered good learners but pahan added that if these results could be replicated in slow learning students cinnamon could become one of the safest and easiest approaches to convert weaker students to good learners cinnamon may halt the progression of parkinsons disease pahan and his colleagues previously found that cinnamon had a positive effect on the brains of mice with parkinsons disease when cinnamon transforms into sodium benzoate it works to protect the neurons normalize brain cells and improve communication within the brain which slows down the progression of the diseasegiven their promising results pahan and his team  supported by grants from the national institutes of health  plan on moving forward with testing in human patients with parkinsons diseasethis could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in parkinsons patients pahan said it would be a remarkable advance in the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disease he addedbefore starting to add cinnamon to all your dishes know that not all cinnamon is created equal pahan explained that there are two major types of cinnamon available in the united states  chinese or cassia cinnamon and ceylon cinnamon while both metabolize into sodium benzoate ceylon cinnamon is much better than chinese cinnamon chinese cinnamon contains coumarin a

executive to put her into the white house see the email here hillary clinton known as the bride of frankenfood  is a longtime supporter of monsanto a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the clinton regime which even a former fbi official now describes as a criminal operation the monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than charles w burson monsantos former executive vp secretary and general counsel burson who retired from monsanto in  but still maintained an active monsantocom email address all the way through  was praised by monsanto ceo hugh grant for pushing the corporations international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations its sickening via pr newswire  on behalf of the monsanto board of directors and the employees of monsanto i thank charles for his service to our company said hugh grant chairman president and chief executive officer of monsanto during his tenure monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses charles has played an important role in building the companys legal organization to better serve our growing business not only in the united states but also in latin america and asiapacific where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant monsanto seeds and technologies clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind in other words charles burson was instrumental in monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified monsanto seeds  this legal action by monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil antihuman rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world yet the hillary clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put hillary clinton into the white house where no doubt she would return the favor to monsanto through government policy decisions at the usda and fdafully consistent with the criminal conduct of the clinton crime mafia charles burson also took part in excusing monsantos illegal bribery of over  indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmersafter caught committing massive bribery and collusion in indonesia monsantos then general counsel charles burson explained that no monsanto isnt a bad company theyre super honest and transparent and ethical toothe company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in indonesia at every stage of this process  beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process  monsanto has been fully cooperative and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company we are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest wrote burson surprise the justice department then defers prosecution of monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened whaddaya know with the corrupt lawless justice department calling the shots monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in washingtonfrom the same link above the justice department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years saying it would dismiss it after the period if monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement so wait you mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing  foreign officials in indonesia  a felony crime under us law  was able to get away with it by claiming they will be honest from now on and the justice department says oh yes youre fine now there will be no prosecution for your serious crimes and then the clinton fundraiser people specifically reach out to the monsanto attorney who orchestrated all this and said hey this guy would be awesome to help support a

against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the clintonsthis racket must end the clintons and all their coconspirators must be sent to prison donald trump is right when he says this is bigger than watergate theres no comparison the crimes of the clintons are a thousand times larger and more damning to democracy than anything richard nixon ever attempted corrupt leftist media still lying every hour in a desperate attempt to defeat trump while all this is happening the corrupt leftist media  washington post new york times msnbc cnn google news yahoo news etc  has long since abandoned any pretense of engaging in journalism and is now allin for the clinton criminal mafiathey have thrown their reputations to the wind betting everything on the most corrupt criminal to ever seek the office of the presidency theyre bleeding readers and viewers by the millions as fedup americans change the channels or turn off their cable tv altogether who needs politicized espn anyway to seek out more accurate news online from sites like natural news and breitbartcom even the mass censorship of political trends by facebook and twitter cant stop the avalanche of awakening now sweeping across america across every sector of society the american people are saying enough is enough we will not allow the criminal democrats to steal this election and install a totalitarian dictator into the white housewe will vote against the establishment in record numbers we will overwhelm the fraud outvote the braindead leftists and achieve a landslide victory for donald trumpand if the corrupt criminal democrats still fake the numbers bribe the electoral voters or commit massive fraud to steal the election we the people will take to the streets and take our democracy back  we the people will not accept a clinton presidency under these conditions of massive fraud collusion and extreme media bias based on everything we are seeing right now there is no scenario under which hillary clinton will be accepted as the legitimate victor of this election in no way has this been an open fair and free election it has been a warped onesided exercise in media collusion that isnt fooling anyonein the minds of the real american people hillary clinton is done for  the people will not stand for more corruption collusion and criminals running our system the revolt has begun  and it will sweep through the voting booths the electorate and if necessary the very streets of america to demand an end to the failed corrupt political establishment run by sinister criminals who belong behind barsget ready my friends to take this country back first vote for donald trump as a vote against corruption and collusion of the leftist establishmentsecondly demand the arrest of all clintonlinked operatives  including those in the leftist lying mediathirdly do not tolerate the theft of your democracy by corrupt clinton operatives who are trying to steal this election if they steal the votes or steal the electoral college outcome prepare to march in the streets to take your country back yes im calling for peaceful mass protests everywhere across america if the criminal democrats and corrupt leftist media steal this election through fraud bring plenty of rope because you may have to swing across moats and scale the walls of the castle to finally reach the inner layers of corruption and criminality in washington dc thats a metaphor for the dumbasdirt leftwing media journalists who are too stupid to parse a sentence defeat clinton now or lose america to a totalitarian regime that will never let go of absolute power this is your last chance to take america back if you allow the clintons and the corrupt democrats to seize power through widespread fraud and theft there will never be an open fair and free election in america ever again  all opponents of clinton will be imprisoned or executed all conservative media outlets will be taken offline or silenced the borders will be opened to a massive wave of illegal aliens from all across the world and they will overrun and occupy america destroying it from within while the bigoted intolerant democrats turn the entire nation into a sanctuary nation where illegals have absolute immunity while patriots are executed or imprisoned

monday october   by j d heyes tags flint  water crisis  epa coverup naturalnews the federal bureaucracy and corresponding state agencies have never been much good at responding to crises in a timely fashion and that tradition was alive and well during the recent toxic water crisis in flint michiganin fact according to a newly released watchdog report americans now know that the federal environmental protection agency epa could have intervened in the crisis a full seven months before it finally did meaning thousands of residents in flint would have had to drink far less water tainted with leadas reported by the associated press  the epas inspector general said that the agency had the authority and enough information to issue emergency orders to protect flint residents from the leadcontaminated water they were drinking as early as june  seven months before officials finally declared an emergencyinspector general arthur elkins said in an interim report that the water crisis should have created a greater sense of urgency for the epa to intervene when the safety of drinking water is compromised everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else the drinking water in flint became tainted with unsafe levels of lead after city officials decided to begin drawing from the flint river in april  in a bid to save money the broke city of about  residents north of detroit was under state control at the timeregulators did not make sure that the water was properly treated so lead from aging pipes leached into the supply the ap reportedsince the discovery of high levels of lead federal state and local officials have traded accusations about who is most to blame for the crisis  even as residents are still forced to drink bottled or filtered waterdoctors have detected higher than normal levels of lead in hundreds of children around the city and many taps remain offlimitsgov rick snyder a republican appointed a panel to look into the matter it concluded that the state is fundamentally accountable for the lead crisis due to decisions made by state environmental regulators as well as stateappointed emergency managers who were in charge of running the citybut that said once the epa discovered that water being consumed by city residents was tainted with unsafe levels of lead snyder believes the agency should have acted  and he is rightas gov snyder has stated all along what happened in flint was the result of failure of government at all levels his spokeswoman anna heaton said recentlysince the crisis began officials have tried to reshuffle the deck so to speak and call it reform they say some state agencies have undergone culture changes that will supposedly prevent future recurrences of epic failure according to heaton who called such changes encouraging people should be held accountable  but wont be its unclear how many people actually believe that considering that state agencies had mandates already to protect the public from polluted and contaminated water as did the epa by culture changes does heaton mean that people were fired and actually replaced by others who will do what taxpayers are paying them to doflint mayor karen weaver a democrat who took office after the crisis emerged said agencies like the epa and the michigan department of environmental quality are there to help ensure the wellbeing and safety of men women and children yet they failed in their core mission to do so she also called for those who are responsible for the crisis to be held accountable though we advise her not to hold her breathas for the epas inspector general report it said that the agencys midwest region did not issue an emergency order because officials concluded actions taken by the state prevented the epa from doing so the report says that their interpretation was not correct and that according to federal law when state actions are deemed to be unacceptable the epa can and should proceed with an emergency order designed to protect the public in a timely mannerwithout epa intervention the conditions in flint persisted and the state continued to delay taking action to require corrosion control or provide alternative

monday october   tags james comey  fbi mutiny  clinton investigation naturalnews as america inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media  another kind of revolt is taking place inside the fbi according to multiple sources in the independent media  now the only remaining free press in america  fbi director james comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into hillary clintons private email server by livid fbi agents who threatened to go public if comey didnt actjames comey long since suspected to be a clinton operative who deliberately allowed hillary clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations now finds himself with his back against the wall if he releases the evidence against hillary clinton already possessed by the fbi he will face the wrath of obama the clintons the corrupt loretta lynch doj and the entire leftist media if he once again gives hillary clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes he then faces a mutiny inside the fbi which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media fbi agents under comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames agents inside the fbi in other words refuse to allow james comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the clinton crime family via the daily mail uk  james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director this dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through james comeys reputation as he is the fbi official who reportedly ordered the execution of robert lavoy finicum whose suspected execution by fbi agents was caught on tape because the oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury it means fbi head james comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man under comey  and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the fbi  comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free for many fbi agents who have spent their entire careers serving the fbi as honest dedicated federal agents the thought of allowing james comey to singlehandedly commit political arson and burn down the fbis hardwon reputation is just too much to bearresignations are beginning to pile up on comeys desk as livid fbi agents head for the exitsvia the daily mail the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades comey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom and while the decision to reopen the case may appease fbi agents and republicans in the shortterm we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence as such we continue to question just how long comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post adds zero hedge  at a bare minimum in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation we fail to understand how an independent investigation into hillarys email server isnt warranted james comey is an arsonist and hes going to burn the fbi to the ground unless his agents mutiny the upshot of all this is that james comey is an arsonist if his own agents dont force him to apply the law to the clinton investigations comey will burn the agency to the ground leaving its reputation in ashes and that sadly will make the world a very dangerous place for all the fbi agents in the field because everyday americans would begin to see them all as corrupt lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kindthe truth is that most fbi agents are hard working professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists financial fraudsters kidnappers murderers and other dangerous criminals yet if james comey doesnt defend the fbis reputation by indicting hillary clinton  he will likely be placing fbi field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in dccomey in other words is more dangerous to the entire fbi than any other single person in washington right now if he doesnt find his moral compass and guide the fbi through this crisis with law and order intact hes going to go down in history and in flames as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the fbi and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populaceno doubt hell get an extra bonus from loretta lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in america and announce that hillary wont be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else remember if comey gives hillary clinton a free pass he demonstrates to all americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in washington  and if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes then practically speaking why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all james comey if you want to salvage the fbis reputation announce a recommendation for the indictment of both hillary clinton and loretta lynch if theres one thing abundantly clear in all this its that both hillary clinton and loretta lynch should be behind bars  clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss lynch is a thirdrate attorney who was tossed into the doj solely because of her gender and skin color not her credentials and neither one respects the laws of america of course both are deeply corruptif the fbi hopes to have any reputation remaining after the hillary clinton campaign implodes either before or on november th comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows hillary clinton had clear intent to violate national security laws  among other serious crimesall comey would have to say is something like in the view of the fbi hillary clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as commander in chief and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security and so on with a single sentence comey could reinvigorate the fbi and position himself as an historic american heroright now id imagine the clinton

assume they consider it justified hyperboleteam clinton has succeeded in perpetuating one of the greatest evils i have seen in my lifetime her side has branded trump supporters  of voters as nazis sexists homophobes racists and a few other fighting words their argument is built on confirmation bias and persuasion but facts dont matter because facts never matter in politics what matters is that clintons framing of trump provides moral cover for any bullying behavior online or in person no one can be a bad person for opposing hitler rightsome trump supporters online have suggested that people who intend to vote for trump should wear their trump hats on election day that is a dangerous idea and i strongly discourage it there would be riots in the streets because we already know the bullies

message is about uniting all americans under one flag the clinton message is that some americans are good people and the other  are some form of deplorables deserving of shame vandalism punishing taxation and violence she has literally turned americans on each other it is hard for me to imagine a worse thing for a presidential candidate to doill say that againas far as i can tell the worst

we all know about the popular and ancient practice of oil pulling but many of us dont understand how this practice works or how exactly it benefits our teeth oil pulling began in ayurvedic medicine thousands of years ago and has achieved widespread popularity in modern society today 
but the question remainsdoes it help your smile and how 
the claims of oil pulling 
lets take a look at each of these popular claims of oil pulling 
it makes your mouth healthier by pulling out bad bacteria that can cause cavities and gum disease oil pulling can actually make your mouth healthier and even stop chronic bad breath 
it whitens teeth research has not proved this but some people claim they get whiter teeth with oil pulling this should be considered a side effect of oil pulling albeit a great one rather than its main purpose 
it heals cavities oil pulling can remove the bacteria and plaque that cause tooth decay but typically oil pulling alone is not enough to heal cavities you need to stop eating so much sugar get more vitamins and minerals such as k d and calcium and switch your toothpaste to help heal cavities with oil pulling 
it cures disease ancient cultures used oil pulling as a way to draw out toxins from the mouth to prevent them from affecting the body research doesnt show whether or not oil pulling can help any type of disease but research does link oral health to body healthso a healthy mouth could help you prevent heart disease  respiratory illnesses and even cognitive decline 
what the research says 
now that weve seen the popular claims of oil pulling lets find out what modern research actually says about this ageold practice 
research shows that oil pulling can actually the stop inflammation bacteria plaque and bad breath associated with gum disease therefore it may be an effective treatment for gum disease combined with a healthy diet and great oral health practices 
it can decrease the likelihood of tooth decay and reduce overall plaque content in the mouth oil pulling can also help prevent tooth loss and oral diseases such as oral cancer periodontal disease and oral thrush oil pulling may be able to reverse tooth decay but only when combined with other healthy practices 
although research hasnt proved that oil pulling helps decrease your chances for developing chronic disease keeping your mouth healthy and free of toxins can benefit your whole body 
the verdict 
if you want to give oil pulling a try do this practice every day put a tablespoon of oil in your mouth preferably sesame or coconut and swish it around for up to twenty minutes as soon as you wake up spit out in the trash then brush and floss your teeth as normal easy 
the verdict is in oil pulling can help you get a beautiful and healthy smile but it should not replace regular brushing and flossing as your oral care routine practice oil pulling first thing in the morning before you eat or brush then enjoy the benefits of a healthy smile without giving up your brushing and flossing habits you might also like",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Woman-Free-Freedom-Happy.jpg,junksci,herbal teas highest antioxidants,fight inflammation vitamins minerals get httpblogsnaturalnewscomfightinflammationvitaminsmineralsget twain yobra posted monday october pm edt vitamins minerals play vital roles body one important role fighting inflammation reduce risk diseases like arthritis heart disease antiinflammatory vitamin minerals include diet vitamin e antioxidant fight inflammation get vitamin e natural sources seeds nuts like almonds peanuts avocado spinach also great sources magnesium research shows magnesium keep relaxed increases energy improves heart health much unfortunately people magnesium deficient good food sources magnesium include beans nuts leafy greens whole wheat bread carrots meat vitamin b low levels b vitamins increase risk inflammation natural sources include broccoli kale cauliflower bell pepper chicken tuna chickpeas glutathione antioxidant definitely fight inflammation get garlic apples tomatoes apples grapefruit avocado vitamin c vitamin c known strengthening immune system reducing toxicity even fights cancer lemon water tomatoes oranges great sources vitamin c vitamin vitamin deficiency plus poor nutrition lead chronic inflammation sunlight popular sources vitamin sources including avocado spinach seeds nuts vitamin k vitamin k prevents body heart disease osteoporosis get vitamin k eggs liver cabbage cauliflower spinach kale coenzyme q antioxidant antiinflammatory properties get natural sources like olive oil walnuts peanuts spinach mackerel beef liver sardines vitamin vitamin protects body free radicals increase levels vitamin eating carrots broccoli sweet potato kale collard greens cantaloupe dandelion spinach information eating healthy staying fit download free weeks flat stomach guide help improve health physique like facebook page might also like,1,

low cholesterol and its consequence 

previously we have seen that cholesterol is a critical element of our cells and tissues  in addition scientific evidence suggests that high cholesterol is not necessarily harmful but offers a protective effect against brain disorders such as alzheimers disease  at this point we should ask the opposite question what about if we have too little cholesterol what are the consequences 

without cholesterol we would die 
it is well known today that cholesterol performs several important functions in the body one of the best important is not the most important function of cholesterol is to assist the proper regulation of the immune system indeed people who have a low blood cholesterol have an anergic immune system ie a lack of reaction by the bodys defense mechanisms to foreign substances vredevoe et al  in other words your body cannot fight off pathogens such as bacteria viruses parasites and fungi without cholesterol the different cells involved in an immune response such as macrophages lymphocytes etc cannot recognize the invaders and destroy them interestingly it was shown that the ldl particles are the ones needed for an adequate immune response masterjohn  these particles neutralize microbes and toxins before they cause any damage to the tissuesorgans and we call these ldl particles bad cholesterol without them we would be dead another fact is that a low blood cholesterol increases our risks of developing tuberculosis 
more importantly a sufficient supply of cholesterol to the immune system is critical to eliminate cancer cells indeed cholesterol is needed to slow down the progression of cancer in addition to cholesterol saturated fats like palmitic and myristic acids are also necessary for an optimum immune system these fats are found in tropical oil such as coconut oil would this fact explain why asian people have a lower rate of cancer than north americans 

is cholesterol protective not causative of heart disease 
there is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest that microbial infections are one of the primary drive force of plaque accumulation in the arteries of the heart   in support of this a lack of buccal hygiene considerably increases your risk of heart disease  some researchers have noticed that people who suffered from a heart attack also had the flu a few days prior   it seems that those microorganisms change the structure of the blood vessels leading to inflammation and an accumulation of plaques at the sites of injury based on this evidence we can propose that cholesterol actually minimizes the risk of developing heart disease via the elimination of dangerous pathogens indeed it seems to be the case  
it is time to end this war on cholesterol science is very clear cholesterol does not cause heart disease on the contrary cholesterol is a vital element of a vibrant health by making sure the immune system is strong by being a critical component of vitamin d synthesis by helping the body make sex hormones among other functions",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Rooibos-Tea-Red-Drink-Cups-Pitcher.jpg,junksci,drink carrot juice daily make,keywords better tasting food gmos homestead homesteading clicked link got page cant pretend interested homesteading longer im sure afraid effort afraid wont know afraid time get get going homesteading years wouldnt change anything world husband made many mistakes along way never afraid put hard work get job done hard work become one rare profitable homesteads surviving reasons want try homesteading dont base mine hoping spark interest get feet make dream become reality provide healthy food family vegan vegetarian allergic gluten completely aware putting bodies dont like buy vegetables grocery store produced chemically also dont like buy meat fed sorts things dont know everything put kitchen table feed family grown produced someone know know corn ate last night grown using organic soil water little alpaca poop good measure pork also came farm know everything pig ate happy two years life im saying healthiest family world know arent eating chemicals matters husband food tastes much better food produce homestead much better food purchasing grocery store truth looking produce much perfect looking food fast dont want grow strands produce take little longer taste exponentially better meat also takes better arent rushing either mention fact feeding animals healthier better tasting food slaughter food taste better well animals stressed get slaughtered produce meat much tougher meat produce homestead freedom many people say complete freedom please day doesnt mean dont responsibilities take hour middle day attend elementary school winter concert also take doctor appointments middle day office isnt insane want get freedom life start homesteading today economic security economy crashes risk going without anything really need dont rely anyone basic necessities including source income everything need order survive right homestead isnt much go wrong government could put us risk apocalypse prepper say homesteaders prepared disaster occur knowledge experience tasks needed extreme survival situation people know kids understand meaning hard work im saying kids dont understand meaning hard work kids done nine year old wakes two hours school takes care chickens every day chickens completely responsibility know allow kids use electronics time know difference time chore time feel like part team doesnt feel like making chores every day might also like,1,

if you clicked a link that got you to this page you cant pretend that you are not interested in homesteading any longer im not sure if you are afraid of the effort afraid that you wont know what to do or what you are afraid of but its time to get up and get going 
i have been homesteading for over  years and wouldnt change it for anything in the world my husband and i have made many mistakes along the way but we have never been afraid to put in the hard work to get any job done for all our hard work we have become one of the rare profitable homesteads that are more than just surviving 
we all have our own reasons that we want to try homesteading so dont base yours off of mine i am just hoping to spark some interest to get you off your feet so you can make your dream become a reality i provide healthy food for my family 
we are not vegan vegetarian of allergic to gluten but we are completely aware of what we are putting into our bodies i just dont like to buy vegetables from the grocery store that have been produced chemically i also dont like to buy meat that was fed all sorts of things that i dont know about 
everything that i put on my kitchen table to feed my family has been grown or produced by me or someone i know i know that the corn we ate last night was grown using some organic soil water and a little alpaca poop for good measure the pork also came from our farm and i know about everything that pig ate in his very happy two years of life 
im not saying that we are the healthiest family in the world but i know we arent eating chemicals  that is what matters to me and my husband the food tastes so much better 
the food that we produce on our homestead is so much better that the food you are purchasing at the grocery store the truth is that they are looking to produce as much perfect looking food as they can as fast as they can they dont want to grow the strands of produce that take a little longer but taste exponentially better 
the meat also takes better because you arent rushing that either not to mention the fact that you are feeding the animals with healthier and better tasting food when you slaughter the food yourself it will taste better as well animals that are stressed when they get slaughtered produce meat that is much tougher that meat that we produce here on the homestead freedom 
not many people can say that they have complete freedom to do what they please during the day now that doesnt mean that we dont have responsibilities but we can take an hour off in the middle of the day to attend the elementary school winter concert we can also take those doctor appointments in the middle of the day when the office isnt insane 
if you want to get freedom over your own life start homesteading today  we have economic security 
if the economy crashes we are not in risk of going without anything that we really need we dont rely on anyone for any of the basic necessities including a source of income we have everything that we need in order to survive right here on the homestead there isnt much that can go wrong with the government that could put us at risk 
i am not an apocalypse prepper but i will say that homesteaders are more prepared should a disaster occur we have more knowledge and experience in all of the tasks needed in an extreme survival situation than most people i know our kids understand the meaning of hard work 
im not saying that your kids dont understand the meaning of hard work but my kids have been there and done that my nine year old wakes up two hours before school and takes care of the chickens every day those chickens are completely her responsibility and she know that 
i do allow my kids to use electronics during down time they just know the difference between down time and chore time they feel like they are part of the team so it doesnt feel like we are making them do chores every day you might also like",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cannabis-Drug-Marijuana-Plant.jpg,junksci,sugar industry funding research sugarcoat truth,back pain pain side important treat properly reduce risk severe conditions kidney abscess blood poisoning severe infection kidney failure causes kidney infection many reasons lead kidney infection like weakened immune systems anatomy urination toilet hygiene kidney stone sexually active females home remedies help treat effectively stay hydrated drink enough fluid best way keep body hydrated addition important prevent kidney stone water helps reduce risk salt minerals probably form stone try drink glass lemon juice refresh kidney look benefits lemon top natural benefits lemon diet eat drink affect kidney condition otherwise recommended foods researchers showed put daily diet apples onions cabbage cauliflower foods reduce inflammation ease kidney infection symptoms however caution amount phosphorus diet phosphorus cause serious situation calcification lifestyle large number bad habits might push condition severe prolong healing process drinking much alcohol smoking lacking sleep therefore try stop smoking alcohol sleep enough help body healthy apple cider vinegar apple cider vinegar great treat infection inside body kidney infection treated apple cider vinegar acids remedy reduce inflammation get effective apple cider vinegar combine honey mix teaspoon honey teaspoon apple cider vinegar drink several times per day know health benefits apple cider vinegar visit ways apple cider vinegar benefits herbal tea many types herbal teas good body chamomile tea marshmallow tea parsley tea herbal reduce infections prevent kidney stone whats eases symptoms shortens duration use least twice day get effectively baking soda probably first time heard baking soda may treat kidney infection true baking soda replenishes bicarbonate levels kidney put one teaspoon baking soda glass water drink several times per day garlic garlic related passing salt urine therefore good diuretic properties potentially garlic help body prevent heart disease skin problems garlic contains allicin avoid bacterial infection resources,1,
Sasha Brown,2016-10-27T23:08:00.000+03:00,why marijuana should be legalized across the globe,"keywords complimentary medicine  holistic health  homeopathy  nhs 
the department for health is currently reviewing whether or not homeopathy in the nhs should continue to be available through doctor referrals against a backdrop of funding cuts and increasing pressure to reduce costs the government and health managers are looking at whether to add homeopathy to the nhss schedule  blacklist a selection of products that nhs doctors are banned from prescribing 
however despite consistent claims that there is a lack of quality evidence into the positive health benefits of homeopathy the nhs has spent more than m on homeopathic treatments over the last  years and any proposed ban is likely to have its fair share of detractors 
almost six million brits seek the help complementary and alternative medicine of which homeopathy is a part with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the nhs 
the lead argument for the exclusion of homeopathic treatment is lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness with research often being labeled as inconclusive however proponents for the inclusion of homeopathy argue that this doesnt necessarily mean that there is no evidence 
dr helen beaumont a gp and the president of the faculty of homeopathy has recently stated that homeopathic treatment has a profound effect on patients 
its disappointing that at a time when the nhs is facing a funding crisis the department of health is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year if the department were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the nhs but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions 
george freeman the minister for life sciences has stated that in a time of rising demand the government has a duty to ensure nhs funds are spent only on the most effective treatments however an article in the british medical journal bmj that examined the scientific evidence behind nhs treatments found that  of  commonly used nhs treatments are of unknown effectiveness and only  are known to be beneficial the argument is being made that the principals being applied to homeopathy are consistent for all forms of treatments throughout the nhs 
collating research itself has also proved to be difficult with the positive effects of homeopathy often a challenge to fully quantify the nhs is driven by targets and trial evidence using hard data like death and disease to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment researching and recording a patients quality of life happiness and emotional satisfaction has always been much more difficult to quantify but a wealth of anecdotal evidence and studies from other european countries continue to support the use of homeopathic treatment 
for example in  over a hundred homeopathic gp practices in germany and switzerland took up the challenge  of demonstrating the health of chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment it concluded that homeopathy is clinically effective costeffective and safe  with the results playing an important role in the inclusion of homeopathy as part of their national healthcare scheme 
similarly the largest study at bristol homeopathic hospital  followed the effectiveness of homeopathy on  consecutive patients over a sixyear period  of followup patients reported improved health with  reporting major improvement 
the debate whether homeopathy in the nhs will no doubt continue the homeopathic profession has had to face increasing criticism and hostility over recent years but with an average annual spend of  on homeopathic treatment the equivalent of  of the total nhs drug budget it should be remembered that if these patients were not treated with homeopathic medicines they would have to be treated by other nhs departments with potentially more expensive conventional drugs   bmc public health bmc series    doi

there was a time when my sons eczema became so severe i was willing to try any natural healing method my baby was  months old when he developed eczema we tried the usual dose of steroids and overthecounter creams from our family doctor it got so bad that his scars were not healing he wasnt sleeping and i wasnt sleeping as a child my mother took me to an acupuncturist for migraines and the migraines stopped after a handful of visits i remember it being a pretty relaxing experience with the smell of incense and herbs and the quietness of the room so i took a leap of faith and booked us for an appointment with a traditional chinese doctor who specialized in skin disorders allergies and asthma why try acupuncture  traditional chinese medicine reason  acupuncture has been practiced for almost  years in china 
with that much history its worth a try it is a method of relieving pain or curing an illness by placing needles in the patients body at precise points along the  meridians in the body meridians are energy pathways that are associated with different organs within the body the world health organization lists  ailments that are treatable by chinese medicine  acupuncture reason  acupuncture has helped children with eczema 
in a study of  children who were treated with chinese medicinal herbs the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by  in  of the children see sources although it was a small study size the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks when my son was a baby even a  improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us reason  acupuncture does not hurt babies 
many people worry about the needles hurting but the needles that acupuncturists use are about  th of a syringe needle my son was a baby when we started the treatments and he never cried out when getting the needles in him reason  acupuncture relieved my babys eczema by  
acupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers our doctor stabilized the eczema best of all flareups only occurred when my baby was teething his skin was softer than it had been in months acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of  months in order to see an improvement this is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response which is a long process but sometimes babies will respond quicker than that we used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor and applied it to his skin this topical mix had a similar effect as hydrocortisone cream if i applied it  times per day with a cotton ball reason  acupuncture is affordable 
this is true especially if you go to a student clinic you can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors for child and baby treatments it is even more affordable it cost us about  per visit on average we tried a few different clinics some health plans will cover acupuncture so check with your health plan to see if yours covers it to keep it affordable i suggest trying to find a specialist in acupuncture  tcm traditional chinese medicine not a practitioner who does many different types of treatments tips for helping your child while getting acupuncture 
bring a favorite stuffed animal a book or some toys try nursing your baby while they are receiving acupuncture a baby only needs the needle in the acupressure point for a second and then they are pulled out adults typically have needles in for  minutes for each treatment because our bodies do not respond as quickly as babies bodies do check out my youtube video for more tips find an experienced  accredited acupuncturist 
make sure to look for an accredited acupuncturist or tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor be sure the acupuncturist has some experience in your condition chat with the people in the waiting room and see if theyve had success with your doctor i met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the chinese doctor we were going to see that made me feel more comfortable 
find a tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor who offers certified organic chinese herbs certified organic means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides as well there have been some reports of heavy metals residue in chinese herbs herbs are just as powerful as prescription medications and can have adverse effects if used improperly make sure to ask about the testing done on the herbs that you or your baby are prescribed every condition has different treatment needs

this is just a straight up fact especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated as you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches sometimes the votes appear to be flipped as in a voter intends to vote for candidate a but candidate bs name is selected on the screen 
when this happens it is known as vote flipping and is supposed to only happen rarely with millions of votes cast there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade these are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often im just saying im seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed remember voting machine malfunctions do happen 
there are reports of this happening already in north carolina texas and nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks 
you have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iphone or the ipad and most of them use technology from the late s lawrence norden a voting technology expert at the brennan center for justice in new york told time as these machines age you start to have hardware issues 
one problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right in other cases it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis

when most people think about their eye health  the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about for example there are a staggering  common disorders that can plague your eyes these issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines fortunately there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy 
nutrients your eyes need 
there are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes lutein zeaxanthin and mesozeaxanthin each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals as natural news has pointed out before free radicals are the main basis of all injuries illnesses and deaths 
antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals so its a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye but what happens when something interrupts this process sadly you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness 
instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen you can be proactive and start taking supplements the good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin although this isnt usually disclosed on the label in fact it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin 
of course this doesnt absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not mesozeaxanthin is present in their products however their negligence also doesnt reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients in addition to stocking up on these supplements it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants including vitamin e vitamin c and beta carotene 
food sources 
there are many foods that contain antioxidants  carrots are perhaps the most wellknown resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene it would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource though you can also turn to oranges tomatoes sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins these are some of the best foods for eye health even better you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs pistachios corn peppers and kale with enough of these food items in your diet you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy 
additional eye health tips 
if you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health now is a good time to carefully consider quitting unfortunately people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration optic nerve damage and cataracts if you begin abstaining from tobacco products now though your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline 
other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible if you use a computer for work take a  second vision break every  minutes 
ultimately combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life if youre currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises this is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses as usual the natural way is better

tuesday november   by j d heyes tags china  organ harvesting  political prisoners naturalnews in the us these days supporting gop presidential nominee donald j trump will earn you an assault from leftwing cowards and bullies who support democratic nominee hillary clinton  but in china being a political dissident and opposing the ruling communist government could earn you a trip to a hospital operating roomwhere youll have your organs removed for waiting transplant touristsas reported by the epoch times  chinese officials began persecuting the  million practitioners of falun gong in july  and have continued to do so ever since to the chinese communists there is no such thing as a religious deity or belief because communists insist that their form of government should be the only thing requiring loyalty and faithfulnessnot long ago this kind of treatment of chinese dissidents would draw loud rebukes from the us government the united nations and various human rights organizations around the world as well as major media coverage but since the chinese manufacturing economy has become such an integral part of the economies of most of the worlds advanced countries outrage has been mutedthe lack of outrage and subsequent media coverage and pressure by governments has essentially given the chinese communists a green light to treat falun gong  and anyone else deemed a political dissident  in any barbaric way they choose a new form of evil hence the creation of a cottage industry of sorts  transplant tourism as the epoch times noted this is essentially  murder on demand  for an organ that is purchased ahead of time by someone who then travels to china for a transplant operation it is a huge source of revenue both for the chinese military and for private hospitals around the country according to nobel prize nominees and investigators david matas an international human rights attorney and david kilgour a former canadian foreign secretary for asiapacificmatas and kilgour published their first investigative report in   and evidence about forced harvesting of organs in china from prisoners of conscience has only mounted in the years since the investigators found that the overwhelming majority of the pool of victims did not come from prisoners sentenced to death but rather from prisoners of conscience primarily followers of falun gong  the largest group in chinas prisonsin their  report matas described the systematic harvesting of organs from falun gong adherents by the chinese communist party as a new form of evil we have yet to see on this planetone of the founding board members of doctors against forced organ harvesting dafoh dr dana churchill spoke at rallies in los angeles and santa monica beach earlier this month she said that to this point the world had never witnessed a more horrific and barbaric crime as the chinese communist party has committed against falun gong crime against humanity she added that it wasnt just falun gong adherents who were being victimized however others include christians the uyghurs and tibetans all of whom have also had their organs harvested while they are alive unwilling and between  and  years old the prime of their life churchill  a naturopathic doctor from pasadena calif said epoch times noted that recently released findings on the number of chinese prisoners who have been murdered go way beyond original estimates collected from various investigators and organizationschurchill said with falun gong approximately  have been murdered and that is according to dafoh our organizationat a washington dc rally on july   following nine years of investigation the world organization to investigate the persecution of falun gong announced that it had concluded that since july   the chinese communist party ccp lead by its former head jiang zemin has utilized chinas entire state apparatus to harvest organs from living falun gong practitioners as a way to physically destroy the group as a

garbanzos to give your body an iron boost you can also try other iron and vitamin c pairings  like strawberries with oatmealwhile all of these foods are quite healthy on their own if you are looking

tuesday november   by vicki batts tags fda  adhd drugs  market withdrawal naturalnews adhd medications have been subject to public scrutiny for quite some time two years ago the fda said it had discovered problems with a generic version of a popular adhd drug known as concerta the generic produced by the pharmaceutical company mallinckrodt just wasnt up to snuff and now the fda seems to finally be making moves to pull this inferior product off the shelvesgeneric drugs are approved by the fda through their abbreviated new drug application anda process in the anda process the federal agency is primarily focused on data that shows the generic drug is a bioequivalent for the reference listed drug or what many people refer to as the brand name drugthe term bioequivalent means that there is no substantial differences in bioavailability between a generic drug and the brand name product specifically it suggests that the extent and rate of absorption of two drug equivalents over the same period of time at the same dose and under the same conditions should exhibit similar results as the fda explains on their website the generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patients bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drugunsurprisingly discrepancies in actual equivalence are often discovered after a generic has been approvedmallinckrodts concerta generic is not the only brand name knockoff under fire kremers urban pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of the lannett company also manufactures a generic form of the medication that the fdas center for drug evaluation and research cder has deemed insufficientas reported by the regulatory affairs professionals society cder tracked the issues from december  through june  ran a reanalysis of bioequivalence data and determined that the mallinckrodt product may deliver methylphenidate into the body at a slower rate than concerta during the time period of  to  hours postdosing following the cders findings mallinckrodt filed a lawsuit which was thrown out by a maryland federal judge the pharmaceutical company has since declined to voluntarily withdraw their product from the marketplace and according to the fda the drug manufacturer has yet to submit any new data or information that confirms the bioequivalence of their product to concertasimilarly the cder concluded in june of  that the data on the kremers product is insufficient to determine whether or not their generic product is therapeutically equivalent to concerta in november that year the fda announced that their product was not sufficiently equivalent to the name brandboth manufacturers may submit a request for a hearing to the fda within the next month so they can attempt to show why approval for their drugs shouldnt be withdrawnof course the fdas concerns about the apparent lack of efficacy seen in these generic drugs is rather ironic given the magnitude of other concerns surrounding these drugs in  a cbs news report revealed that  people died and  more suffered serious cardiovascular problems following the use of adhd medication in a period of just four yearsthat may not seem like a lot but is important to recall that the fda adverse event reporting system faers which is used to track such events is a voluntary system only drug manufacturers are required to report adverse events  if they know about them doctors patients and family members are under no such obligation psqh reports that drug safety experts estimate that only about  percent of all adverse events will even be reported  who is to say how many people have been harmed by adhd medications and other drugs and dont know it or havent reported itthe faers website itself states that because of its own limitations faers data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the us population and yet in spite of this very statement the fda itself used this information to form a safety reportover the years several adhd medications like adderall xr have been linked to sudden death  cardiovascular problems and psychosis according to consumer reports  the longterm safety of these drugs has not been evaluated or studied sufficiently and there is evidence to suggest that the benefit of such drugs wears off after about two years many kids take adhd medication for quite a bit longer than thatin spite of all of this the fda has yet to pull these drugs from the shelves and is instead concerned with drugs that arent strong enough medications that dont work obviously dont belong in the marketplace however drugs that are killing children dont belong there either

posted tuesday november   at pm edt 
joint pain prevents us from exercising or doing simple tasks like walking unfortunately it only gets worse as we age this happens because the fluid synovial fluid in the joints reduces as we age reduction of this fluid increases friction on the joints and leads to arthritis 
but research also shows that uric acid can cause arthritis buildup of uric acid in the joints can damage joint tissues and cause pain the buildup happens when the kidneys dont excrete enough uric acid it can also be triggered by the body converting purines to uric acid fast longterm buildup of uric acid can cause inflammation and reduce your mobility 
switch to an alkaline diet 
theres been a neverending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not in fact some experts have discredited them as useless but what does research say well this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine on the other hand researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid 
another study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body and they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints 
note that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal 
eat these alkaline foods 
you simply need to reduce intake of acidic foods and eat more alkaline foods alkaline foods are mostly vegetables and legumes red pepper",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Vitamin-B12-foods.jpg,junksci,alkaline water kills cancer make,ad hbs account httpblogsnaturalnewscombiblicalbeginnings hesh goldstein posted tuesday november pm edt beginning earth without form void darkness face deep satan said doesnt get better god said let light let earth bring forth grass herb fruit tree yielding fruit god saw good satan said goes neighborhood god created man woman saw lean fit god populated earth broccoli cauliflower spinach green yellow vegetables satan said know get back game created cheeseburger man said supersize fries gained pounds satan brought forth chocolate woman gained pounds satan brought forth fried chicken fried steak big needed platter mans cholesterol went roof god sent running shoes man resolved lose weight satan brought forth remote control espn espn man gained another pounds god said youre running score devil brought forth potato vegetable naturally low fat brimming nutrition satan peeled healthful skin sliced starchy center chips deepfat fried man clutched remote ate potato chips swaddled cholesterol went cardiac arrest satan said good god sighed created quadruple bypass surgery satan created hmos obamacare aloha learn hesh listen read hundreds health related radio shows articles learn stay healthy reverse degenerative diseases use organic sulfur crystals incredible bee pollen ever please visit wwwhealthtalkhawaiicom email heshgoldsteingmailcom call since going radio products began sell work oh yeah going wwwasanedietcom allow read various parts book sane diet insane world containing wonderful comment mike adams hawaii tv stations interview local authors books write newspapers book reviews one would touch sane diet insane world goes advertising dollars might also like,1,

George Zapo,2016-10-28T20:04:00.000+03:00,volunteers succeed at eliminating food waste and hunger,"keywords alzhemiers disease  anxiety  dementia  depression  food  health  ibd  ibs  immune system  mental health  nutrition  weight loss fermented foods  reasons to consume this food group every day 
im sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily what are fermented foods 
bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost the bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lactofermentation the yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation 
these yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food what it does to the food provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health provides beneficial enzymes increases the amount of b vitamins biotin and folate increases the bioavailability of minerals provides short chain fatty acids which helps to improve your immune function provides you with gaba your calming neurotransmitter how can eating fermented foods help me optimize your gut health 
why this may not seem like a big deal it is your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut your gut may be in bad shape from nsaids antibiotics unknown food allergies the standard american diet and more 
ideally you want more good bacteria populating your gut as opposed to bad bacteria fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the standard american crap food diet have a disrupted microbiome 
so you can take all the supplements in the world but if your gut is in bad shape are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money 
a healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system immune system digestive system and nervous system so as you can see a healthy gut is critical to your wellbeing support your immune system 
the more beneficial bacteria you have the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds flu allergies and more almost  of your immune system is found in your gut thus it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system one needs to support their gut health 
asthma and autoimmune conditions among numerous other health issues are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut the less diverse your microbiota is the greater association with many chronic health issues 
adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection aid in weight loss 
studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weightdifficulty losing weight obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals 
in a  study it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study in a  study obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for  weeks those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group digestivebowel issue improvement 
those with ibs or ibd may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet dr david williams states that to eliminate digestive issues you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods kefir in studies has shown to improve symptoms of ibs and ibd research has shown that anywhere from  to  of those who make this change adding in fermented foods will notice a significant difference in their ibs symptoms improved mental health mood control and behavior 
the gut is considered your second brain a healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies for this reason to get more variety of probiotic strains it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over mix it up for instance have kefir one day kombucha the next fermented vegetables the next day and so forth 
many of you know that gaba is your calming neurotransmitter but did you know that fermented foods can supply you with gaba too oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase gaba content significantly whereas gaba in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues 
another study looking at  college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety fear moodiness worry envy frustration and loneliness 
it is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed gaba even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders reduce the risk of brain diseases such as alzheimers 
some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that alzheimers disease is in fact an autoimmune disease and as many of you may know having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road for any autoimmune disease the immune system must be supported so it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for ad if you want to support your brain than i suggest that you add in fermented foods 
along with the benefits above fermented foods can also benefit those with autism and help prevent hpylori you dont need a whole lot of fermented foods daily start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say  tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day what to add in 

look for the product to say raw and fermented these foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables  eat these cold dont heat them up bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods kimchee  this is a korean version of fermented cabbage carrots onions and garlic kefir usually made from cows milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk it has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt i buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast if you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir if you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion avoid the kefir until issues resolve opt for the other fermented choices instead tempeh indonesian type of cake with a nutty taste and chewy texture a good vegan source of protein too kombucha  a fizzy fermented tea most stores carry a variety of flavors now dont go overboard on the kombucha however some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts ie several bottles per day report symptoms of gas and bloating miso a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces a miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make 
notice i did not sat yogurt while some yogurts may contain some probiotics many others are sugary processed foods in disguise yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the abovementioned foods

Ron Yahaloms,2016-10-28T19:59:00.000+03:00,natural remedies that will help you get rid of blackheads quickly,"what we all should be doing first thing in the morning a simple cheap and effective way to jump start your metabolism weight loss and improve your health 
what if i told you that by doing this every day making it part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth would help you to lose weight flush out toxins hydrate your body and skin improve brain function give you more energy and decrease your appetite would you do it 
drinking water upon rising in the morning can have huge health benefits some people call it water therapy and has its origination in ayurvedic medicine it is purported to help with numerous diseases such as cancer asthma high blood pressure arthritis diabetes and migraines 
to reap the benefits drink the water upon waking ideally  minutes before you eat and make it part of your morning routine most us are walking around in a dehydrated state so start your day off the right way 
ideally filtered water that is void of chemicals and fluoride is best i personally like the berkey filter system as this is affordable for many instead of a whole house system most water pitchers are ineffective for removing most of the chemicals in our water but there are a couple good ones out there such as the clearly filtered pitcher but even if you dont have a water filter system it does not mean you should not drink up 
for most people  oz of water in the morning is the right amount others say to drink double this amount this may be a lot of water to consume for most people first thing in the morning my suggestion would be to start out with  oz and slowly work your way up to the higher amount and see how you feel moderation is key as too little or too much water is never a good thing 
the  glasses filled with  oz of water is a myth and no science behind this reasoning another simple rule is to divide your body weight in half and drink this amount in ounces but if you are a large person this may feel like you are spending your day drinking water 
instead focus on getting that glass of water first thing in the day and then add in water herbal teas fruits and vegetables during the day if your urine is very pale yellow throughout the day then you are hydrated if it is a bright yellow to orange drink up riboflavin a b vitamin can make your urine a bright yellow benefits to drinking water first thing in the morning it can jump start your metabolism 
it can increase your metabolism by  for the first  minutes after consuming that glass of water another study showed that it can increase your metabolic rate by  for the next  minutes after the water is consumed hydration this is more important that you think when dehydrated we may experience brain fog lack of energy and metal clarity hydrating in the morning can increase the flow of oxygen which is energizing hydrating will also help the skin to look younger flushes out toxins 
support your kidneys by helping them to flush out toxins and give your body the water it needs first thing in the am speed up the detox process by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to your morning water this is best done prior to brushing your teeth in the morning as the film on your teeth will protect the enamel from the acidity in the lemon juice support brain health 
your brain tissue is  water not having enough water can make you feel tired drained and can cause mood swings prevent you from overeating just by drinking water you feel full studies show that those who consume water before every meal lost an average of  pounds over a threemonth period thats with no dieting not changing your eating habitsjust adding in water less colds and flu 
staying hydrated helps to maintain the health of your lymphatic system which also affects how your body fights off infection 
if you are looking for a simple cheap and effective way to improve your health and stimulate weight loss then this is it

Caleb Stephen,2016-10-28T19:54:00.000+03:00,how to survive a nuclear fallout,"keywords medical equipment  stethoscope facts  stethoscopes history 
when we hear the word doctor the first image comes in our mind is a person in a white coat with a stethoscope hanging around his neck the stethoscope has become a very common name amongst people thanks to its display in various tv shows movies and frequent use of it by doctors but still there are many fun facts which other people might not know about stethoscope so here they are  
 years old history  yes stethoscopes are one of the oldest inventions which are still being used across the world by millions of doctors rene laennec in  had invented the stethoscope it was a wooden instrument and looked quite different from what we see it as now 
i see your chest  stethoscope is a greek word which roughly translates into i see the chest stethos means chest and scope mean examination 
an interesting story behind its invention  when stethoscope was not invented doctors would put their ears around the chest of patients and gently tap the chest with fingers this technique would make female patients little uncomfortable rene laennec was a very shy person once he was examining an overweight woman he found it difficult to hear her hear sounds to hear heartbeats of that lady he rolled a quire paper into a tube and placed it on her chest this inspired him to make the device which we all are familiar with and called stethoscope 
google doodle for rene laennec  on february th  rene laennec would have celebrated his th birthday to commemorate this day google doodle marked his th birthday 
used to identify if a person is dead or not 
nowadays stethoscope is used to hear heart sounds and to determine symbols of other diseases but initially stethoscope was designed to find out if the person in the hospital is dead or alive 
it might be replaced very soon 
as mentioned stethoscopes were invented almost  years ago and being in use for such a long time shows that how useful and efficient stethoscopes are however as the technology is getting advanced every passing day stethoscopes might be replaced very soon by pocketsized ultrasonic devices which can perform multiple measurements on patients

jeery park,2016-10-28T19:52:00.000+03:00,what happens to our lungs brain  mood when we use a himalayan salt lamps,"keywords cranberries  cranberry  cranberry juice  kidney disease  urinary tract infections  uti  utis 
cranberry juice and tablets have been recommended as a way to either prevent recurring urinary tract infection uti or treat the symptoms but a new study finds theres no difference between people treated with cranberries or placebos 
a lack of evidence for cranberry juice or capsules as being an effective preventative measure or treatment has been a recurring argument in the scientific literature for years now cranberry juice  an unrealistic recommendation for utis 
a urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria gets into your urine and travels up to your bladder according to the urinary care foundation  utis cause more than  million visits to health care providers each year about  in  women and  in  men will have symptoms of at least one uti during their lifetime 
for years now cranberry juice has been recommended to aid in preventing or treating utis however theres no solid evidence that any amount is having a positive effect 
additionally based on the results of a recent study led by infectious disease specialist manisha juthanimehta from the yale school of medicine even if you switch to highly concentrated capsules you still dont see a noticeable positive effect 
in response to this recent study lindsay e nicolle an expert on utis from the university of manitoba advises the following 
the continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent uti in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings 
nicolle adds clinicians should not be promoting cranberry use by suggesting that there is proven or even possible benefit any continued promotion of the use of cranberry products seems to go beyond available scientific evidence and rational reasoning it is time to move on from cranberries myth versus facts 
theres a couple of reasons why the myth that cranberry juice is beneficial in preventing and treating utis has persisted for so long 
first the active ingredient in cranberries  atype proanthocyanidins pacs  has been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to the wall of the bladder so a vast majority of people have reasoned that if bacteria are causing utis something that blocks bacteria from accumulating in the bladder could be a potential preventive or treatment measure 
but according to timothy boone md phd vice dean of the texas am health science center college of medicine houston campus and chairperson of the department of urology for houston methodist hospital theres one problem  
cranberry juice especially the juice concentrates you find at the grocery store will not treat a uti or bladder infection it can offer more hydration and possibly wash bacteria from your body more effectively but the active ingredient in cranberry is longgone by the time it reaches your bladder 
dr boone adds it takes an extremely large concentration of cranberry to prevent bacterial adhesion this amount of concentration is not found in the juices we drink theres a possibility it was stronger back in our grandparents day but definitely not in modern times 
for example ocean sprays cranberry juice cocktail is only  percent juice something so watered down could not be so ineffective 
the second reason the myth continues is that its a tempting myth to believe if you experience recurring utis and want to prevent them  or you want to feel empowered while youre waiting for the antibiotics to take effect  drinking cranberry juice or taking capsules is a fairly easy and simple way to feel like youre helping resolve your problem 
unfortunately though youre paying a lot of money for something thats only really doing the same job as a glass of water and cranberry juice is full of sugar anyway golden rules for kidney health 
you can do a number of things to help keep your kidneys functioning properly at every stage of life 
heres a list of ways to reduce the risk of kidney disease  including urinary tract infections drink plenty of liquids especially water  drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that youll urinate more frequently  allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin stay active and keep fit  keeping fit helps to reduce your blood pressure staying active and keeping fit also reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease eat healthy and keep your weight in check  this can help prevent diabetes heart disease and other debilitating conditions associated with chronic kidney disease reduce your salt intake  the recommended sodium intake is  grams of salt per day  around a teaspoon try limiting the amount of processed and restaurant food and dont add salt to food its easier to control your salt intake if you prepare the food yourself with fresh ingredients dont take overthecounter pills on a regular basis  common nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  like ibuprofen  are known to cause kidney damage and disease if taken regularly this type of medication probably doesnt pose considerable danger if your kidneys are reasonably healthy and you use them for emergencies only however if you are dealing with chronic pain  like back pain or arthritis  work with your doctor to find natural ways to control your pain without putting your kidneys at risk wipe from front to back  doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra change your birth control method  diaphragms or unlubricated or spermicidetreated condoms can all contribute to bacterial growth avoid potentially irritating feminine products  using deodorant sprays or other feminine products such as douches and powders in the genital area can irritate the urethra empty your bladder soon after intercourse  also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria regularly control of your blood sugar level  about half of people who have diabetes develop kidney damage so it is important for people with diabetes to have regular tests to check their kidney functions

con artists who prey upon the weakminded ie democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that theyre voting for hillary  if we dont stop them now they threaten to turn america into a fourth reich  complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the clinton regimethese democrats like dirty donna brazile want to run america like haiti  complete with all the corruption bribery scandals and economic collapse that third world countries routinely sufferbut filthy scumbags like brazile are about to find out something rather shocking we the people wont tolerate your lies and corruption any longer we the people are going to arrest you indict you prosecute you and see you and your coconspirators behind bars where you belong the trump movement is awakening tens of millions of americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in washington theres an unstoppable movement rising up in america now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power if they steal the election we will take to the streets and declare a clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal  we will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the us armed forces depose you and remove you from office  to announce new elections without the festering cancerous stench of the dnc and the clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filthwe the people have had enough of you demons you creatures from hell you walking bags of antihuman reptilian snakes who pretend to be leaders in washington your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end and you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government racketsfrom breitbartcom  racketeering former prosecutor andrew mccarthy has recently observed that hillary clintons abuse of the state department looks an awful lot like a racketeering enterprise which could trigger the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of  more widely known as rico mccarthy explainedunder rico an enterprise can be any association of people informal or formal illegitimate or legitimate  it could be a mafia family an ostensibly charitable foundation or a department of government it is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity a pattern means merely two or more violations of federal or state law these violations constitute racketeering activity if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute its time to defeat clinton  followed by arresting all the clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these third world fraudsters thats how we take back america restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order note to the feds arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in america remember if federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the clintons and all their coconspirators they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority at that point the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes obey federal laws abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in washington at allafter all a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law at that point justice becomes a sad tragic joke against the citizens and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens revolt if the fbi wont seek criminal indictments against hillary clinton and her criminal cohorts sooner or later the military or the citizens will do it for them  health ranger approved aquatru water filter back in stock

tuesday november   by lj devon staff writer tags heart failure  pain management  antioxidants naturalnews when elderly patients with joint problems start taking common painkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen their risk of heart failure increases this is the finding of a uk study published in the british medical journal  the study investigated  million people with an average age of  from the uk the netherlands italy and germany those who took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids were rushed to the hospital with heart failure  percent more often than those who did not take the drugs the same awful correlation was not made for those under the age of  but the study does point out that serious health problems are being ignored and numbed by painkillers dealing with the root cause of inflammation is more important for longterm health regular use of nsaids is becoming a popular strategy to help manage pain later in life using these overthecounter painkillers may take the edge off the pain but continued use does not deal with the problems that are causing the inflammation in the first place and old age is not the reason for the painfor this reason elderly patients could benefit more from natural antiinflammatory substances that work with the bodys healing process over time giving the body phytonutrients such as astaxanthin curcumin and capsicum do much greater damage repair than nsaids these plant based medicines go after the free radicals that are causing damage at the cellular levelnumbing the pain is not enough and allows heart conditions to go unnoticed leading to heart failure  pain within the joints and tissues is a signal to the conscious self that there is indeed a breakdown an imbalance or a deficiency when nsaids are thrown at the problem regularly there can only be a numbing of the real problems that the elderly patient faces when the correct nutrients are absorbed and toxins are removed then the root problem sending the message of pain can be repaired better pain management essential for the elderly flu shots and other vaccines containing aluminum are pushed on the elderly as medicine the aluminum acts as an inflammatory adjuvant to trigger the immune system to respond to the virus material in the vaccine the inflammation and genetic damage that aluminum is known to cause may be exacerbating pain in elderly patients and causing damage to their nervous systemsnatural substances that repair the nervous and immune systems would be better advised for the elderly population however the medical system and the common patient do not understand how to use substances such as phenolic compounds that come from plants these real life medicines possess antioxidant properties that act as therapeutic agents to counteract oxidative stress something as simple as siberian ginseng  eleutherococcus senticosus  can be included in the diet to provide greater mental and physical stamina this root contains a powerful combination of sterols coumarins flavonoids and polysaccharides that lessen the effect of stress on the body allowing one to adapt to high stress situations and manage pain more effectively sources

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",2016-10-29T14:00:00.000+03:00,herbal tea can help with indigestion and insomnia,"the truth about zika its a grand medical hoax 
monday october   by j d heyes tags zika virus  medical hoax  infectious disease naturalnews one of the most interesting things about the zika virus is that it is not a new ailment it was first discovered in monkeys in  and in humans in  according to a fact sheet from the world health organization while researchers have admittedly probably learned more about the virus since it was first identified some of the health problems now being associated with zika  such as microcephaly in newborns  have never before been seen leaving many to wonder if there isnt some sort of conspiracy being devised by globalists to suit their political agendafor instance according to truthwiki  an investigative site that has recently delved into the history of the disease populations in the past that were heavily infected with zika never reported a single case of a newborn with a shrunken head the current outbreak is far from being the only one in the s outbreaks occurred in oceania and southeast asia and in  the socalled yap epidemic which occurred on the yap main island  part of the caroline island chain in the western pacific  infected threequarters of the population but no cases of newborn birth defects like microcephaly were reported so the current hysteria over microcephaly allegedly being tied to zika appears completely unwarranted will we see another swine flu fiasco with the zika vaccine the same year truthwiki reported using funding that was provided by the bill and melinda gates foundation a genetically altered version of the virus was developed by oxitec oxford insect technologies a british biotechnology company roughly two years later in the fall of  gates helped usher in the first outdoor trials of genetically modified transgenic aedes aegypti mosquitoes which are the species known to transmit the disease they were released ostensibly to fight the spread of mosquitoborne diseases including dengue yellow fever and zika  among others the plan was to get the gm mosquitoes to mate with females to produce offspring that would die soon after birth thereby halting the spread of the disease but truthwiki noted there was another agendain may  the who and the brazilian government colluded to spread propaganda that there were nearly  million suspected cases of zika in brazil and recommended that the deadly poison pyroproxyfen be spread to include areas of drinking water the propaganda disseminated was that since mosquitoes were breeding in those areas of standing water then they too had to be treated with the chemical which was then spread primarily over povertystricken areasthe next thing we know scores of cases involving microcephaly in brazil began cropping up and they were then blamed on zika coincidence many think not whats more there were really only about  children born malformed  not plus as originally reported truthwiki points outas truthwiki notes further zika is a mild viral infection  always has been  and resembles the typical cold or flu most of those afflicted with it suffer a lowgrade fever some pain in their joints a skin rash and conjunctivitis in other cases people have no idea theyve even been infected if symptoms appear at all they may last up to a week but like chicken pox a onetime zika infection can provide lifelong immunity while severe cases of zika may require hospitalization they are rare as are zikarelated deaths overkill and yet despite the virus relatively mild symptoms the us government is set to pay a japanese big pharma firm as much as  million to develop a vaccine  natural news reported recently if thats not overkill then nothing is  especially given the fact that most vaccines contain harmful substances and preservatives another disease outbreak emergency another vaccine with even more harmful chemicals and preservatives will go on the market in fact due to the gravity and dire nature of the zika emergency we may even see mandatory vaccination as we did with the swine flu fiasco in the mids then a mandatory program of vaccination for the illness which only killed one person led to a dramatic spike in guillainbarre syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves causing paralysis ironically today the centers for disease control and prevention is claiming that zika may be causing gbspropaganda anyoneread the entire truthwiki report on the zika hoax here

wednesday november   tags deep state  clinton cartel  damning evidence naturalnews my fellow americans we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime as of today i am now convinced that the deep state has turned on hillary clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the clintons reign of terror over america and collapse her bid for the presidencythe mainstream media of course will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal clinton cartel as such they will lie to the public to the bitter end even as the clinton titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep frigid waters no less with no more lifeboats to be foundthe socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided hillary clinton is too damaged to defend any longer  even if she were to win by stealing the election she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survivalit has now been decided i believe that hillary clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the nsa and fbi this will likely happen before the coming weekend once that is accomplished the next goal will be to wait for president trump to take office then destroy the us economy through a controlled global debt collapse so that trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies remember the deep state isnt protrump theyre still all about defending the establishment but hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomachinstead of allowing hillary clinton to take power and destroy america from the top in other words deep state power brokers have reverted to plan b which is to let trump take the white house then destroy america through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy this is simpler than it sounds bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly  trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science all they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates monetary gravity will do the restin the mean time hillary clinton and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice  lying under oath destruction of evidence conspiracy corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for manythe criminal racket of the clintons is about to implode the participants will be charged under the rico act for racketeering activities for which ample evidence already exists a new video from steve pieczenik describes some of this in this video intelligence insider steve pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the clinton coup thats attempting to take over america and destroy it from withineven if you dont believe pieczenik  and i fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing weve initiated a countercoup the clintons are going to go full murder in a last ditch desperate effort to save themselves beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days like a cornered wild animal the clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselvesi will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like james comey whod better have armed security personnel around him at all timeslook for desperate measures such as the clintons attempting to blackmail obama comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins we might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the clintons are now on their own they would need the assistance of obama to pull off another sandy hook you see a deal has already been struck with obama most likely deep state operatives have already struck a deal with obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as hillary clintons head is served up on a platter this likely explains why obama is now publicly saying he trusts comey and refuses to go to bat for hillary theres no love lost between obama and the clintons remember as all this is going down the propaganda ministry of the clinton regime  cnn nyt washington post etc  is going to explode into an allout batst crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the russians extraterrestrials bigfoot and the loch ness monster for everything thats imploding around the clintons mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke maybe crop circles were created by the russians as a secret code to wikileaks and donald trump ehmeanwhile conspiratorial operatives like george stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition  so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put hillary in the white house via any means at their disposal including totally faking negative news against donald trump which is of course the entire news mission of cnn at this point a disgraced propaganda network run by antiamerican traitors if the vote is stolen for hillary clinton all hell breaks loose should the globalist soros operators manage to steal the vote bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place hillary clinton in the white house all hell breaks loose across america  the fbi goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the clinton criminal regime donald trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud the rigging of voting machines the attempted bribery of electoral voters and so on the us military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose clinton and restore democracy this one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated and yes you will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose clinton and restore open fair and free elections armed us citizens prepare for a massive march on washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption fraud and murder expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds the nsa likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against hillary clinton this will likely be joined by cia assets who already have the goods on the clintons and their lolita express pedo joy rides wikileaks anonymous and every former nsa analyst goes into destroy the clintons mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the clintons and anyone close to them anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help i expect kim dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward hillary clinton as do we all come to think of it the establishment republicans in the us congress will as usual meekly surrender to the democrats pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough totally useless politicrats like john mccain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something these useless heaps

wednesday november   by j d heyes tags food poverty  hunger  obama administration naturalnews a democratic presidential nominee  hillary clinton who is by far the establishment candidate in this years presidential race  wants to take over from another democratic president barack obama she is promising to carry on his successful economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them and yet by any true measure the economy has been a disaster under obama real growth has nearly flatlined  real unemployment figures  when a proper count is taken  is far higher than what is being officially posted by the administration  and  million americans cannot get enough food without government assistancein fact on that last point and as reported by natural blaze  in the obama economy in americans are going to bed hungry on most nights if not every nightand clinton wants to double down on obamas economic policies how can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry americans for the past eight years americans have had to listen to lectures from obama and other democrats about how we as a firstworld nation should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens and increasingly to noncitizens  but shouldnt a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people tooof course but malnutrition during the great economic recovery of the obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the us thats because in real terms workers wages are falling and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tablesfor many particularly the low paid sic this means two things fuel and food poverty  natural blaze reportedlow salaries combined with stagnant wages jobs going to illegal immigrants and parttime work rising as obamacare forces fewer companies to retain fulltime employees mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury and of those who can still afford food many have to settle for cheap nutritionpoor junk foods and foods high in starches carbohydrates and calories now winter approaches and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil which traditionally produce higher pricesbut the establishment media is part of the problem for example in february bloomberg reported that in americans were on food stamps despite an economic recovery  no one should ever be hungry in america unless they choose to be what recovery obamas economy is growing at about  percent a quarter  far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide wellpaying jobs to the tens of millions needing themso the caveat is disingenuous a more accurate story would have reflected on the in figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among americans to find better employment opportunities in fact the story makes no sense when you analyze it either the economy is really good and a in ratio is no big deal or the ratio is a big deal because the socalled economic recovery isnt reaching enough people which is itits the latter of course and while america will always have a portion of the population that is too sick too old or too lazy to produce  and they will be a net drain on the treasury  the

wednesday november   by ethan a huff staff writer tags americans  life expectancy  plummeting health naturalnews for many years the assumption has been that the united states leads the world as an advanced civilization dominating in categories like education quality of life and life expectancy but a new study released this year by the society of actuaries soa paints a much different picture suggesting that americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generationsthe page report reveals that the average yearold american man today will most likely die just short of his th birthday while the average yearold american woman only has about two years longer until she dies on average around age  this might not sound like anything out of the ordinary except that these figures are actually down compared to last years report using the same criteriaover the past several years the report explains american health has taken a major downturn life expectancy amongst yearolds is down by about six months on average its also down for younger americans who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations in nearly every generational category including baby boomers generation x and millennials life expectancy is down and will likely continue to go downthis is especially the case among middleaged nonhispanic whites who a recent study by princeton university found are increasingly succumbing to the detrimental effects of bad habits like alcohol and drug abuse unhealthy diet and lack of exercise this report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our societymortality rates are

contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear if they arent the average american life will likely continue to decline into the future pension payers insurance companies see dollar

current data it appears that a decrease is on the waythe updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations says dale hall managing director of research at the soa however it is up to pension plan sponsors working with their plan actuaries to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuationswith the growing

wednesday november   by j d heyes tags mushrooms  monsanto  pesticides naturalnews is bioagriculture giant monsanto king of genetically modified foods and seeds about to suffer an irreversible decline while the planet earth gets a huge chemical reprievewell it may be a bit too early to declare the st louisbased corporation dead in the water but that day may soon be upon us thanks to a nifty new pesticide patent that would make bioag chemicals unnecessaryas reported by the website anonymous  one man who has dedicated his life to the study of mushrooms may have just stumbled upon the one invention that will dramatically change the way we protect food crops from voracious pestspaul stamets has unearthed medical cure after cure and he says the key to saving the planet can be found in the mushroomstamets one of the worlds leading mycologists  if not the top researcher of fungi  filed a patent in  that has since been all but ignored why because most of his research has been viewed as hostile to conventional industries including the pesticide industry anonymous notes that some executives of the pesticide industry have remarked that the patent he filed was the most disruptive they had ever seen kills pests naturally and with zero impact on the environment and indeed a read of the patent reveals a remarkable claimthe present invention relates to the use of fungal mycelium as a biopesticide more particularly the invention relates to the control and destruction of insects including carpenter ants fire ants termites flies beetles cockroaches and other pests using fungal mycelia as both attractant and infectious agent the patent saysin other words fungus that can be present on crops will both attract destructive pests and then infect and kill them after they have eaten it in his patent stamets claims that more than one fungus can be used in combination can be dried or freezedried then packaged and reactivated for use as an effective bioinsecticideno more chemicals no more spraying no more need for monsantos chemicalfirst approach to growing our foodin his patent stamets noted that the widespread use of chemical pesticides is a primary cause of a number of secondary environmental problems that occur besides the death of targeted pests they include soil poisoning the toxifying of underlying water tables and aquifers as well as the pollution of surface water due to runoffin addition they lead to increases in cancer allergies neurological diseases immune disorders even the deaths of some agricultural workers and consumers have been linked to the use of chemical pesticidesincreasingly regulated and even banned in some countries chemical pesticides like monsantos roundup with the cancercausing primary ingredient glyphosate  have become so dangerous that many communities are scrambling for natural solutions to pest problems who knew mushrooms could be so lethal to pests this guy did compounding these problems many pest type or vermin insects have developed a broad spectrum of resistance to chemical pesticides resulting in few commercially available pesticides that are effective without thorough and repeated applications the patent says in addition to being largely ineffective and difficult and costly to apply chemical pesticides present the further disadvantage of detrimental effects on nontarget species resulting in secondary pest outbreaksbut his invention he wrote offers the agriculture industry an environmentally benign alternative to insect control by working to attract insects that latent preconidial mycelium that is fresh dried or freezedried that later infects and kills the hostinfected insects will then carry the fungal hyphae back to the central colony then disperse the fungal pathogen even furtherin essence he wrote fungal mycelium is both a baitattractant as well as a food insecticide and all without harming one thing in the environmentits a harmless pesticide that works without genetically modifying our food poisoning our earth and filling humans with toxins using just mushroomsnow  who will step up and market it you can bet it wont be monsanto

the new world order might seem a bit farfetched for many a handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age the thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists there is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist that belief has been reiterated many times mostly from the mainstream media there are people who see the world for what they are told it is others see whats really going on behind the curtain the stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful they either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives 
global megacorporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis a select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat if humans stay busy working  weekly hours for very little income they wont have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand the top  percent doesnt want americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",2016-10-30T13:00:00.000+02:00,why hydrogen peroxide should be in every home,"doctors prescribe deadly opioid for painrelated issues that arent even legal share in big pharma  fda  harmful medicine  health  medical marijuana  pharmaceutical drug addiction 
corruption bribery death all three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called insys theraputics they are currently under legal fire for subsys a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl a very fast acting opioid that is  times more potent than morphine the under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream the federal drug administration fda has ruled that subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain 
sarah fuller was a  year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia  she didnt have cancer but that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing subsys for her aches and pains the fentanyl acted quickly with sarahs already prescribed xanax a benzodiazepine she died her family is suing the manufacturer but why did sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved thats easy to answer just follow the money 
as stat reports the sales of subsys grew to  million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer like sarah fuller doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner or lunch over  million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity 
take the example of nurse practitioner heather alfonso from illinois she was paid  to go to dinner with a few people and in response prescribed  million dollars of subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain she didnt contest the allegations against her 
getting paid to speak isnt automatically a bribe but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to susbys marketing methods alabama prosecutors built a case against nancy reed perhacs who used to be a sales representative for insys theraputics ms perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend provided he prescribed subsys her take was  other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in kansas rhode island new york oregon michigan florida and new hampshire 
the chief executive founder and chairman of insys theraputics is billionaire john kapoor hes been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups kapoor thinks doctors are all ethical his new fda approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol thc called syndros as states legalize the real medicine in cannabis  thc and cbd oil  this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott

the new york times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former united states house of representatives speaker gingrich a republican has asked the times whether they have any reporters editors or columnists that will say they voted for trump he elaborated to ask if they have since hired any trump supporters to work those positions for the times the paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any republican reporters at all 
gingrich has also asked if the new york times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering the fourth question asked by gingrich wondered if the times reporters would surrender any pulitzer prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions here are the final questions that the times struggled to address have its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions  such as the papers coverage of trumps tax returns has it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated news stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop trump has it retracted its shameful electioneve frontpage story reporting on trumps innermost thoughts and feelings virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters opinions and speculationsfeaturing claims like he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention

hillary clinton could probably spend  hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news some republicans may be coming back to trump 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up democrats are very close to generation defining win but victory is not sealed yet more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend but the polls may not matter 
if most of the ballots in states like north carolina and florida are cast before election day the polls may end up meaning very little

hopefully as a country well return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare but this year when the man at the top of the republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses isnt likely to be that time

this type of language from someone who used to be  and thankfully no longer is  a member of the united states congress is abhorrent but its also to be expected in the trump era of american politics 
after all not long ago trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate supreme court judges 
if she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks the republican nominee said although the second amendment people  maybe there is i dont know 
more recently trump said that hed like to see what happens if clintons bodyguards were disarmed 
i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons disarm immediately he said take their guns away lets see what happens to her 
not only does walshs rhetoric align perfectly with what trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign but its also a continuation of dangerous language that the former republican congressman seems to enjoy using 
earlier in the year when five police officers were gunned down in dallas walsh blamed president obama tweeting this is now war watch out obama watch out black lives matter punks real america is coming after you 
before trump hit the scene this type of rhetoric existed but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee

Natural News Editors,2016-10-31T08:22:49.479+02:00,dilbert creator scott adams endorses trump says hillary is a bully,"by sean colarossi on wed oct th  at  pm not even an overwhelming victory by hillary clinton is likely to convince republicans that they should do their job share on twitter print this post 
since republicans have essentially conceded that donald trump is going to lose the general election to hillary clinton theyre already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate supreme court justices 
according to a report from the huffington post on wednesday one conservative thinker says that john mccains recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by clinton isnt that farfetched 
the report 
some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to mccains controversial suggestion last week that senate republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all supreme court nominees put forth by a future president hillary clinton 
who needs a fully functioning supreme court after all 
as a matter of constitutional law the senate is fully within its powers to let the supreme court die out literally wrote the cato institutes ilya shapiro in a column wednesday on the federalist 
shapiro is wellversed in constitutional issues and his argument has a legal if contorted basis nothing in the constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nations highest court  if not an entire branch of the federal government  to stop clinton from selecting judges who share her views 
 
to shapiro theres nothing wrong with even more senate obstructionism because the constitution is completely silent on how the upper chamber provides its advice and consent on the presidents nominees 
 
so when you get past the gotcha headlines breathless reportage and inauguration day if hillary clinton is president it would be completely decent honorable and in keeping with the senates constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names he concluded 
the original argument from republicans was that they would block president obamas supreme court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the nov  election forget the fact that this isnt how the constitutional system is meant to operate but that was their reasoning 
now faced with the growing prospect that hillary clinton will be elected the th president of the united states they are beginning to change their tune

as hillary clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq from the beginning had he been president at the time the war still would have taken place because trump was in favor of it 
in fact trumps campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies this would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that america gets mired in more conflicts not less 
for their part the clinton campaign has continued to stand up to trumps attacks on the khan family in an emotional new ad released days ago capt khans father recounts how his son died protecting everyone in his unit khans father asked of trump would my son have a place in your america 
the answer to mr khans question is a resounding no as trump has promised to ban muslims  like the khans  from even entering the united states for those living here already a president trump would treat them like criminals

the democratic national committee has filed papers in federal court against the republican national committee accusing it of violating a  court order intended to prevent voter intimidation 
the motion filed in new jersey says the rnc has supported the efforts of presidential candidate donald trumps campaign to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the  presidential election trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on election day 
democrats arent going to stand by and let trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily democratic areas to intimidate voters 
trumps call for his supporters to go to polling places that arent their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree

Nick Huxsted,2016-10-31T21:47:49.087+02:00,homeopathy in the nhs the big debate,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on thu oct th  at  am trump used undocumented labor to build trump tower and workers told the washington post in  they were working on his hotel illegally   
so donald trump has responded to hillary clintons accusation that he used undocumented workers to build his new dc hotel a room luxury hotel just blocks from the white house trump claims he used no undocumented workers  and as we saw earlier  oh yeah hillary clinton sleeps three days at a time 
trumps decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows not just in the clinton camp republican strategist steve schmidt told msnbc 
he is not doing any of the normal activities that youd be doing  days out in a presidential race for somebody whos competitive you dont take a timeout to tend to your business interests 
as libby nelson wrote at vox  clinton is making her closing argument trump is making infomercials 
all this seems to have stung the thinskinned trump who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in scotland as cbs news sopan deb tweets  trumps defense was a little odd to say the least trumps riff on his hotel is worth your time to read denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says clinton sleeps for  days at a time pictwittercomrlsbebzky 
 sopan deb sopandeb october   
the republican nominee protested to cnns dana bash  for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps it is literally impossible for trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else 
trumps defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism he works all the time while clinton sleeps for three days he says he took an hour off it was a bit more than that to open his new hotel while she wants to sleep all the time 
he says clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days in fact clinton made two get out the vote stops in florida yesterday she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in north carolina and has two appearances scheduled in iowa for the day after 
and trumps heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing considering his track record in that regard 
it is a fact as hillary clinton said yesterday that donald trump once again used undocumented labor to build a hotel he used undocumented labor to build trump tower  and the washington post reports that trumps new downtown dc hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included hispanic construction workers including some workers who say they are undocumented  said one worker in  the majority of us are hispanics many who came illegally 
the old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind in reading trumps denial this is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves this remains true 
nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection and it wont work trump already has his clothing lines made in china mexico and elsewhere and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of american jobs

Jenny Heth,2016-10-31T21:47:50.861+02:00,treat kidney infection with these home remedies,"by rmuse on thu oct th  at  am to avoid climateending global temperature rise it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy sources share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse 
over the past few months there has been a dearth of good news and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical american election where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change even dismissing the horrible flooding wildfires droughts sea level rise melting ice caps hurricanes and worldwide food shortages there have only been dire reports on the level of co permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly recordsetting rise in global temperatures 
this week while most americans were living breathing and bleeding over donald trump and the tortuouslylong presidential campaign the international energy agency offered up some good news for the climate the earths population and even for america 
the good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on tuesday by the international energy agency iea that stated according to new data for the first time renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world 
it may not seem like such fantastic news but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climateending degree c rise in global temperatures it is critical for the world to transition off of carbonproducing fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy generating sources this is particularly true for getting off dirty coalfired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of americas c emissions carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming 
the iea report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly twothirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in and coming from developing and industrialized nations alike for a developing nation it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuelgenerated power sources whether they are dirty coalfired plants or notquiteasdirty natural gasburning generating plants 
the iea also revised its earlier projections for renewable energys continued expansion and growth and  significantly increased the amount of  green energy  it expects to  come on line  over the next five years renewable energy includes socalled green sources such as biomass biogas eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources according to the environmental protection agency epa both terms renewable and green energy include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable 
in addition to prorenewable policies such as the paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the americachina deal to roll back coalgenerated emissions there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables particularly in solar and the iea projected that the worldwide costs for solargenerated power will continue declining by an additional  percent over the next five years onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another  percent during that same fiveyear period 
although the iea report was incredibly good news for the entire planet there was some extra good news in the report about americas transition to renewable energy according to the ieas mediumterm renewable market report the united states is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing what that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the everincreasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity still america has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of americas electricity 
in time and if the koch brothers allow it america may catch up to stilldeveloping nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy 
although there appears to be no downside in this bit of good news the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications the dirty coal industry is facing some struggles?in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices financial mismanagement and new cleanair regulations but the amount of co driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity it is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs 
the iea couldnt pass up the chance to note one sticking point in their otherwise encouraging report  persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy  that renewables are not affecting however since the iea only monitored and tracked the worlds transistor from oil and gas to biofuels they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener significantly cheaper and one hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people 
it is a mystery how republicans beholden to the koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry particularly the dirty coal industry will absorb this good news in the past eight years republicans  the kochs their lobbyists at the heritage foundation americans for prosperity and the american legislative exchange council alec have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals it is likely that the ieas report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome but now that more americans are benefitting from renewable energy particularly solar republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the sun and saving the climate for their childrens future something the ieas report never mentions

to compensate for this trumps campaign has devised another strategy which not surprisingly is negative instead of expanding the electorate bannon and his team are trying to shrink it we have three major voter suppression operations under way says a senior official theyre aimed at three groups clinton needs to win overwhelmingly idealistic white liberals young women and african americans trumps invocation at the debate of clintons wikileaks emails and support for the transpacific partnership was designed to turn off sanders supporters the parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by bill clinton and harassed or threatened by hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women and her  suggestion that some african american males are super predators is the basis of a belowtheradar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the pollsparticularly in florida 
the effort was obvious and according to the polling it is failing 
voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest harvard iop young voters poll sanders started flocking towards clinton in august  and havent left and early voting statistics show that africanamerican turnout is solid in swing states 
the trump campaign has realized that they dont have enough supporters to win so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states 
however for voter suppression efforts like trumps to be effective the campaign must have a credible messenger donald trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message 
a voter suppression effort was expected from the trump campaign what is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it 
people on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by trumps public attack on democracy

rep paul ryan could be out of a job after the election as divided house republicans are already plotting to fire their speaker if trumps defeat triggers a big enough loss of house seats 
if democrats pick up  house seats or more speaker ryan is going to have a major problem because his job will be in jeopardy politico reported that ryans enemies in the house freedom caucus are divided over whether or not to support him 
conservative house republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for ryans ouster because he refuses to change the house rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed the hill is also reporting that conservativehouse republicans are deeply divided on keeping ryan but donald trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the speaker the businessman has repeatedly criticized ryans leadership and was stung after the speaker said he would not longer defend trump after a  tape emerged in which the gop nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women win or lose on nov  trump could put pressure on house republicans to oppose ryan in a speakership contest 
ryan is certain to be leading a smaller house majority in january the size of trumps defeat on election day will help decide how many seats republicans lose 
eight of the nine house republicans who cast votes against ryan for speaker initially will still be around to vote against him again in january 
those close to ryan say that he would step down as speaker before getting into a protracted fight with his own party but the walls are closing in on speaker ryan

watch a clip with glover at the wednesday rally here via nbc news  
glover said the noose was her way of making a point that hillary clinton should be incarcerated at the very least but when asked said she doesnt think clinton should be killed 
yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around for effect 
where is all of the trump rallies violent rhetoric and imagery going 
donald trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame 
the washington post did an incredible story on melanie austin a trump supporter who said trump sees the world like she does she realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to calm her after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against president obama 
the first time she had seen him at a rally in june she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did that she was one among millions at the time her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her she had gotten them in february during a difficult time in her life when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a rant a series of online postings that included one saying that obama should be hanged and the white house fumigated and burned to the ground on her discharge papers in a box labeled medical problem a doctor had typed homicidal ideation 
donald trump and the altright and indeed way too many elected republicans have already pointed these folks at hillary clinton and barack obama as evil people who must be harmed when you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone as trump and his advisers have done suggesting hillary clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad you are responsible for inciting violence 
things are not going well for trump supporters and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the altright media and fox news they smell defeat 
perhaps thats not connected to this specific woman who brought a hillary clinton doll in a noose to wave at a trump rally last night but it is a trend were seeing in general  angry trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric 
there will be more of this not less as trumps likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles 
this is political intimidation that mimics donald trumps despotic promises to jail clinton even though shes been cleared of wrongdoing in all of the relentless republican investigations into her activities as secretary of state 
of which there will be plenty more republicans promise us should she win  because just like the trump camp doesnt want you to vote republicans only want government to work when theyre not in power 
the potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among trump supporters

the th woman has come forward to accuse donald trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape 
in a story that sounds very familiar former miss finland ninni laaksonen told the tabloid iltasanomat that the now republican nominee grabbed her butt just before trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the late show with david letterman in  
before the show we were photographed outside the building laaksonen is quoted by haaretz  trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt he really grabbed my butt i dont think anybody saw it but i flinched and thought what is happening 
as to the veracity of these claims it should be noted that laaksonen didnt seek the tabloid out iltasanomat the second largest paper in the country according to wikipedia  reached out to finnish women who had encountered trump and thats how they discovered her story 
in case youre not already grimacing the former miss finland added somebody told me there that trump liked me because i looked like melania when she was younger 
trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of  melania trump is now  so she would have been expired when this alleged groping incident took place in  
new york magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against donald trump 
donald trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their pssy against their will so its not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the trump machine 
what should be alarming is that donald trump is the best of the best on the republican bench i mean that is supposed to be how this works right a group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it

despite trumps plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies  thankfully 
the remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which trump claimed the process is rigged against him and he will only accept the outcome of the election if its favorable for him 
but trump wasnt done at his buckeye state rally he also made sure to take a dig at minority communities

in a conference call with reporters gen john allen ret said trumps remarks are not only uninformedbut it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops and i took great exception to this however he feels personally about this operation he should be encouraging our efforts publicly rather than disparaging them 
 
while trump appears not to understand basic military activities its not clear to me that hes interested in learning them either because there are a number of experts who i thinkwould advise him otherwise but he seems to be confident in his knowledge and that knowledge i think reveals a lot about what he doesnt know 
 
this kind of rhetoric this kind of disrespect for our military leadership this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day  it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be commanderinchief 
military experts like gen allen feel compelled to criticize the republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief

from june  through september  the trump campaign meaning donald trump spent m on hats according to fec filings  they spent just m on polling unsurprisingly they are behind on polling leading in precisely zero  polls  you want to win an election you need sweet hats abraham lincoln 
trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling pictwittercomtofdqmq 
 jack minor jr jackminorjr october   
and now clinton has four times the cash 
and the washington post is reporting that in the first  days of october trump only raised half as much as clinton according to campaign finance reports his biggest day was the  million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released which tells you all you need to know about his base 
remember when trump claimed he would give m of his own money to his campaign yeah this is a guy who wont even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia he uses other peoples money for that with the election just  days away he has only donated m 
make what you will of this but he had been giving m a month to his campaign in the first  days of october just k in inkind contributions thats right even trump wont invest in his own campaign at this point 
trump pulled in m up to october  down from m in september meanwhile the clinton campaign has pulled in a cool m in that same period she spent less than normal m but that leaves her a war chest of m going into the final stretch 
donald trump says he is a great businessman yet he has spent twice as much on collateral including hats as he has on paying his staff he says he gets only the best people and he bought a lot of his maga hats his campaign site only sells  different styles of hat at  to  apiece 
and according to huffington post  the october  federal election commission filing for trump make america great again committee shows trump spent k of donors money to buy his own book  presumably the art of the deal he profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the  book at  each 
his campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters yet trump told a crowd in geneva ohio that hillary clinton has never earned an honest dollar well i think thats really you know 
trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the white house while turning a personal profit

it is a cruel reality of american electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse and that process has already begun for donald trump 
despite the fact that trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged stolen or unfair his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears the latest washington post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by  points from  the number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from  and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from  to  even trump supporters are split  on whether or not votes will be counted accurately 
part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that president obama did in addressing these concerns but it is most likely that voters are treating trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election 
one of the best indicators of a presidential elections outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win 
hillary clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election which is a hint of the way that people are voting 
the process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the us two party system losing candidates who refuse to go away like sarah palin are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up 
trumps fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end his words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level which is why he still needs to be discussed but as far as changing minds and winning an election it looks voters are in the process of banishing trump from the political island",english,naturalnews.com,http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sauerkraut-Bowl.jpg,junksci,simple daily tip improve health jumpstart weightloss,trump campaign desperate openly celebrating reopening fbis investigation hillary clintons emails trump campaign manager kellyanne conway tweeted great day campaign got even better fbi reviewing new emails clinton probe cnnpolitics httpstcowbltglak kellyanne conway kellyannepolls october problem idea emails save donald trump republican party clinton beating trump fbi first investigation emails clinton led trump congressional hearings emails led trump throughout fbi investigation emails clinton democratic nomination emails story point hillary clintons emails arent big issue majority voters people arent republicans election dont care emails compared trump sexually assaulting women paying federal income taxes sued two states fraud emails seem like quaint political scandal much simpler time also never shred proof hillary clinton anything wrong republicans cant get past basic hurdle needing actual evidence back email conspiracy hillary clinton facing donald trump election moron truly desperate campaign manager clinging last bit hope find would believe reopening email investigation make bit difference election day voters speaking dont care hillary clintons emails,1,

donald trump raised just  million for his presidential campaign committee in the first  days of october about half as much as his democratic rival putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house contest new campaign finance reports filed thursday night showed 
the gop presidential nominee had just  million left in his campaign coffers on oct  compared to hillary clintons  million when the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included clintons war chest grew to  million while trumps totaled  million 
trumps total fundraising dropped  in the first  days of october  million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican vote his presidential campaign is broke and in debt to the tune of  million there isnt going to be a lastminute ad blitz for trump or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day 
the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies which are good for trumps ego but not effective in getting voters to the polls trump promised to donate  million to his campaign but has only given  million  the billionaire who promised to selffinance has run his presidential campaign into the ground trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in october 
fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election hillary clinton is having no trouble raising money which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win

the point is that hillary clintons emails arent a big issue to the majority of voters the people who arent republicans in this election dont care about her emails

the clinton announced that the democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in arizona on wednesday november   hillary clinton will campaign in phoenix arizona days before election day clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election with more people voting in this election than any in history clinton will urge arizona voters to take advantage of inperson early voting voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvotecom

hillary clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue 
the trump campaign already deployed vp nominee mike pence to utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving arizona to prevent clinton from winning a state that has been a given for republicans in previous elections 
the trump campaign is broke the nominee had to give his campaign  million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads

candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in florida democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by four points  and democratic us senate candidate patrick murphy is tied with republican incumbent sen marco rubio  by an almost two toone margin  florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for us senate who supports strengthening gun laws suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month 
the poll was conducted by ppp the americans for responsible solutions pac and it illustrates the dilemma that the florida senate race has created for democrats democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive florida media but there are polls that suggest that sen marco rubios democratic challenger rep patrick murphy has a chance of winning the seat 
if rep murphy can beat sen rubio the defeat would likely put an end to rubios national political career or at least force the florida republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in  and instead focus on a run for governor 
democrats have a real chance to send marco rubio to the unemployment line rubio has been a disinterested senator who just like ted cruz seems only interest in his senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions rubio has provided poor service to his constituents  and doesnt deserve to return to the us senate 
sen rubio has refused to commit to serving his full senate term which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them

did pence read the story no but hes offended so offended because that kind of language is offensive not the actual suppression of the votes but the language because its not our operation 
watch here via msnbcs morning joe  
twice saying he hasnt read the article pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnt read thats offensive to me that kind of language its not our operation pence denied 
donald trump and i want every american who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election and thats our message is to tell the american people that this country really belongs to them that we can have government as good as our people again but its going to take all of us 
and you saw donald trump  say that people who havent traditionally voted republican weve got an agenda to bring our cities back 
pence is twice offended so super offended 
ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way frankly you know it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach donald trump has taken to this campaign its not the approach were taking were reaching out to every american 
pence then claimed independents and even democrats are breaking for trump in fact trump and pence are even losing groups that voted for mitt romney in  pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame republicans into voting for them by saying its time for republicans to come home because trump won the primary 
mike pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done because its just not what i see out there 
trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched 
this explains why mike pence and donald trump ended up together it turns out they are not that different after all in spite of the republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise both pence and trump dont care a whit about facts this is more than typical campaign spin its appalling in context 
the context is that mike pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts 
pence didnt even bother to read the article which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters but why would he 
pence didnt care about any of the groups donald trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand so why start now but he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign

the advance estimate of gdp for the third quarter of  showed that the obama economy grew at an annual rate of  the conservative wall street journal headlined this news with us economy roars back grew  in third quarter 
jason furman chairman of the council of economic advisers summarized the numbers real gdp grew  percent at an annual rate in the third quarter with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending 
this news flies in the face of donald trumps basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix the trump economic plan creates at least  million jobs boosts growth up to  percent and is revenue neutral trumps website claims 
before these numbers trumps previous problem was that trumps economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent isnt revenue neutral and would destroy  million jobs trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run 
the conservativeleaning tax foundation found that trumps plan would cost the us trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by  trumps tax plan could cost the us  million jobs 
according to a report released at the end of july by moodys analytics hillary clintons economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections the analysis shows that if implemented the democratic nominees agenda would create  million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of  percent 
under trumps plan moodys estimated that unemployment would spike to  percent and over  million americans would be put out of work the us economy will weaken significantly if mr trumps economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed the june report said the economy will suffer a recession that begins in early  and extends into even longer than the great recession 
yikes 
trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts trump earned a pants on fire from politifact for this claim made june th  in his presidential announcement speech the last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product  was below zero who ever heard of this its never below zero 
but also they note finally since trump was attacking obama for this bad quarter of growth well just throw this out of the  quarters of negative growth since world war ii  occurred under republican presidents and just  under democratic presidents 
todays new economic numbers help clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under president obama 
hillary for america senior policy advisor jacob leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say todays gdp release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years but hillary clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top independent experts agree her plan would create goodpaying jobs through investments in infrastructure innovation and education

we have a protester by the way were you paid  to be a thug republican nominee donald trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally wednesday evening in kinston north carolina 
trump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by hillary clinton to protest trump but it turns out as usual trumps paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter a man named cj cary who happened to be wearing a gop badge and holding a letter supporting trump but urging him to stop being so offensive 
watch here via raleighs news  observer 
the news and observer reported cary says he wanted to deliver a note to trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups black people women people with disabilities and college students cary an africanamerican says hes an exmarine who also worked in afghanistan as a civilian for the us army 
the irony is no doubt lost on the trump crowd that this man came to urge trump to be more inclusive of african americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out so the answer to his plea seems to be never gonna happen 
cary was wearing a gop badge and his letter slammed hillary clinton and president obama 
leave it to donald to shrink his own tent even more it wasnt enough that he tossed out a baby now hes going after his few minority supporters

thats why its incumbent on the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about clinton said 
clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay she said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice clinton said she had not been contacted by comey on this issue 
when asked what she would tell voters about her emails clinton responded i think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails 
this might be the right place to mention the  million emails the bush administration lost and the private rnc servers they used as context for how important this issue really is to republicans as a value

the republican fbi director james comey wrote the house on friday to inform hopeful republicans that they had found new emails relating to clintons private email that begged further investigation 
it turns out the emails didnt come from clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there except for giving republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote 
federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against comey  
hillary clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point how many years on is this republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its doa the press has followed republicans lead with the absurd email story a story as ridiculous as it is common and a story that was never a story until clinton did it

the reason why the clinton email scandal is getting pushed  days before the election has nothing to with trumps doa white house bid and everything to do with helping republicans keep control of congress 
on the surface the sudden revival of hillary clintons emails looks like an october surprise designed to help republican nominee donald trump the problem with this theory is that both democrats and republicans acknowledge that trump is toast 
unless hillary clintons emails say lol i was the shooter on the grassy knoll there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election in fact the emails fbi director was investigating did not come from clinton or her server they seem to have very little to do with hillary clinton or her presidential campaign 
the emails are like catnip to republican voters who have been promised for years that if they keep sending republicans to congress theyll bring down a democratic president and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival 
for the next ten days republican congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating hillary clinton the republican candidates can pretend like trump doesnt exist because their new pitch to voters is vote for me and ill bring down hillary 
donald trump is a lost cause millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states trump is being out organized and trounced by clinton on the ground

it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
outrage is growing over comeys actions as details about the fbi investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with clinton her emails or her server 
director comeys motives for sending the letter  days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats 
if comeys actions were politically motivated he would be in violation of the hatch act

former doj spokesman for eric holder matthew miller a self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election 
the department and the fbi have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and director comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case miller said on cnn but this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last  days let alone the last  days 
watch here 
miller also held school on twitter about comeys abuse of power which has led to hillary clinton having to defend against a negative i wrote a piece in july on why comeys public comments about clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power  httpstcogcrozqwz 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   he flagrantly violated doj rules with his press conference then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to congress 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   followed by quickly releasing fbi s something they rarely do and which i doubt they will do for future highprofile cases  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   each time he either violated or seriously stretched doj rule  precedent press conference was the original sin  it begat the rest  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   but todays disclosure might be worst abuse yet doj goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   not just public discussion either often wont send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   why because voters have no way to interpret fbidoj activity in a neutral way who is the target of an investigation what conduct  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   this might be totally benign  not even involve clinton but no way for press or voters to know that easy for opponent to make hay over  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   which takes us back to the original rule you dont comment on ongoing investigations then multiply that times ten close to an election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   for whatever reason  there are many theories comey continues to ignore that but only for clinton  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   fbi is undoubtedly investigating links between the russian hack manafort  the trump campaign but arent commenting on it good  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   
miller points out this just smells worse and worse the more we learn linking to this emails were not to or from clinton and appeared like info fbi already had wtf httpstcoysjwfwgzi 
 ken gude kengude october   
the problem with comeys actions isnt that he is investigating hillary clinton the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election it is an established rule that ongoing investigations arent commented on for obvious reasons 
this is quite simply not done comeys reasons for doing this are unclear and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense but its troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rulesagreements of law surrounding the trump campaign which seems to have lowered the bar all around

earlier this week friday fox follies  under the assumption the explosive  and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede  i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it  thats when he got personal  accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues  this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments  i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience 
then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly  watch 
as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof  rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news 
if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailesposttrump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until  ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said 
fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well 
from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that  by the daily beasts tim teeman  
imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be  percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british rupert murdochowned newspaper for over  years

Don Wrightman,2016-11-23T00:03:00.000+02:00,the rothschild family has corrupted global banks news media oil and government,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  am if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect   
president barack obama did not have to do anything wrong for republicans to want to throw him in jail or to impeach him hillary clinton doesnt have to have done anything wrong either apparently for congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected  because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her  
at least that and completely ignoring the facts was the theme on fox news last night though to be fair other mainstream media outlets werent much better yesterday 
megyn kelly fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a faceoff with newt gingrich suggested to chairman of the house judiciary committee bob goodlatte rwv that given the fbi revelations of a complete lack of evidence that hillary clinton has done anything wrong what needs to happen is a special prosecutor 
megyn kelly  let me ask you this if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen a special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect bob goodlatte  well first of all we have said from the outset that the house judiciary committee would follow the truth wherever it leads and we have done that throughout the summer asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the fbi was being conducted we will continue to do that we dont know whats going to happen now we dont know whats going to happen after the election so its pure speculation what will happen afterwards a special prosecutor remember is appointed by the attorney general of the united states so you have to decide whether thats going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the fbi under the direction of director comey right now and the judiciary committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation 
democracy is a fragile thing it is to goodlattes credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in  and that he cautioned megyn kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the house but by the attorney general however the gopled house has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy 
what holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works republicans have decided it only works if theyre in charge and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries appoint special prosecutors if they win or vote to impeach them outright as trumps pet snake at cnn jeffrey lord called for last night  
two points anderson one with  days left this makes donald trumps argument exactly to the point here you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment her paranoia and all of the rest the second thing anderson is and this is the really disturbing thing lets just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election this isnt going to stop there will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that bible this is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly i mean thats something the american people need to consider now 
it is not difficult to see where this will lead hillary clinton has committed no crimes far from being a miscarriage of justice though it is that as well this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity 
this sort of talk is just further evidence that donald trump comes from the same vile brew as paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the rest of the party during the mccarthy era the house took it upon itself to be both judge and jury last night it was fox news egging the house on for more of the same 
this sort of talk is deplorable it is reprehensible and it is dangerous  and strikes at the very heart of our democracy",english,newstarget.com,http://newstarget.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2016/10/Doctor-Money-Bribing.jpg,conspiracy,nyt credibility destroyed simple questions newt gingrich,share twitter print post conference call reporters hillary clintons campaign manager said fbi director comeys letter backfiring energizing clintons volunteers work harder supporters voting even bigger numbers clinton campaign chair john podesta called comeys letter long innuendo short facts podesta said information comes seems overblown podesta went rep jason chaffetz distorting facts undermining legitimacy claiming investigation reopened podesta said comey provided selective information allowed partisans distort facts podesta said theres evidence wrongdoing charge wrongdoing said media reports true investigation nothing hillary clinton hard see amounts anything hillary clintons campaign chair called comey provide answers public clinton campaign manager robbie mook said comey letter motivating clinton volunteers supporters based anecdotes hearing team ground situation created urgency intensity among volunteers activists already high close election volunteers rallying around hillary know fighter turning back rally supporters turn vote early voting goes full swing seeing offices ground also online online space well think already momentum wind behind back going yesterday think increased momentum feeling among activists ground later mook suggested comey letter helping clinton campaign adding fuel early voting fire likely comey letter backfire republicans motivate democrats get support nominee early report pollster two swing states saw impact letter voters hillary clinton may end benefiting comeys actions fbi director might gotten rid one thing could beaten one written paragraph james comey may destroyed democratic complacency,1,

Daniel Greenfield,2016-11-04T13:54:45.696+02:00,obama should just pardon hillary for every conceivable crime,"posted by madeline  oct      daily blog    thanks heru by lisa brown  i find it interesting to experienceobserve i can see their desire to exposehonor their hearts yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do i can see their beauty magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to be a man and feel all this stuff emerging within them i can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore fear of feeling hurt failure and losing control letting anyone in being let down abandoned judged which do not occur on new earth 
it is no different than when we woke up women and feminine energy men yet it is for theyve lived this life of strength of being powerful of being strong and surviving everything for the really really masculine energy man or women but we are talking about men right now their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability which is so totally the opposite for we must allow ourselves that rawnessthat vulnerability in order to truly feel again to bring the walls of protection down to not live in the fear of being alone 
when our soul awakens we desire connection deeply yet we seek it in others first experience after experience activates our unworthiness feeling of notgoodenough lack of intimate lasting connection rejected for not being enough in others minds where they are not intune with their own sacred soul 
we are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now more and more its important to support them show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time its important to open up and share to show them its safe to be seen its important to not impose not pressure not push just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do its important for the women to support the men now yet in very different ways than before 
those who have opened their hearts know that our relationships are very different here we do not hold attachments cords expectations or needs anymore all new earth relationships are powerful beautiful freeing supportive empowering inspiring and a cocreative experience of inservice to ourselves each other and all on earth they are to usher in the new era this one now through unity peace respect support contribution and divine love 
many men have been trying to wake up going through their distortions shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now the more human masculine energy the more safety protection and survival mechanisms there were judgment is huge and its scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you dont have a choice anymore 
women its your time to stepup to be the one that already understands to be the one who holds that space and the stability in place when the old starts to collapse crumble dissolve when emotions start to surface that you didnt know were there when nothing makes sense and you dont understand why you cant keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically we all know what this is like weve been there 
weve been through the collapse to move into creation of the new to rebirth ourselves our own realities and now the men do this too there are many who were not ready before yet those times vibrations are gone you will start to see more men awaken especially the strong ones and the fear of how to deal with this part of your job as an ascended being as a master being as a light tower and a keeper of new earth is to not just hold the space but show them how its all not only going to be okay its going to be awesome 
it doesnt matter what body we are in female or male men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one the providers the ones that dont break when we know better 
when the soul awakens the human aspect does breakdissolve and it doesnt matter what bodies we are in this process is genderless we all have human masculine human feminine and we have divine masculine and divine feminine too 
relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse end reshape or transform often all of these some go their separate ways while each evolves awakens diesrebirthsgrows up as spiritsoul in physical body form 
many womenspartnersfriends roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up just because they struggled before resisted before doesnt mean they still arewill when you show them wayshower that you can handle it you can be the support you can even be the provider if need be then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore 
as masculinefeminine are redefined according to energy and that each can fill all of these roles themselves then the balance can shift easily and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles can support others ready to do this too 
financial support is also a part of this which can be emasculating if viewed through human eyes when one realizes that money is just energy to support us all they let go of the misperceptions and definitions once held by who did what role in the old paradigm money was associated with power which was a masculine thing now money is an expression of gratitude love respect contribution and is to support those stepping intofulfilling their souls purposes and roles here when the focus is taken off of money and put on what is truly important the soul then each can flourish each can receive each can share each contributes the energy of what is important to create a whole new reality of unified existence here 
strength is through the purely open true warrior heart power is the knowledge and wisdom that comes through your own connection as pure source light within abundance is an existence divine sacred love is what makes the difference here union is when souls come together to work together to be together and to bring forth realities consciously together we all have tohad to do this ourselves so that we could createanchorhold the foundation of a whole newremembered existence here 
your soul can see the awakening soul of another you can expand the space or shut it downclose portals whats appropriate will be determined by how conscious present and open each is as a master you have the capability to see understand and do more than you did as a limited and lacking human your energy makes the difference they are going to need to pull away be alone sleep and have someone to talk to without being judged the human aspect doesnt believe its safe to open up without being attacked judged or imposed upon its up to you to show that it is masculine energy believes it when they see it you prove it by being your higher self all of the time their soul will emerge as you do 
higher consciousness existence i love you

issues surrounding a minimum wage bill education and services are being utilized in attempts to overthrow the african national congress 
south african president jacob zuma has come out publically to state that there are efforts underway by the west to undermine the african national congress anc government which has held power for over  years 
a myriad of challenges are facing the south african ruling party including an economic recession the bringing of several allegations about corruption within the office of the presidency a declining stock market and national currency along with increasingly worsening relations with the united states 
in africa there are numerous examples from the postcolonial period of the last five decades where the intelligence and military apparatuses of the imperialist states have sought to reverse the forward progress of the masses of workers farmers youth and their leadership in the recent period in the south american state of brazil the first woman president dilma rousseff of the workers party was forcefully removed from office in a political coup 
in addition to the decline in the south african economy largely due to the overall world crisis which has driven down commodity prices and systematically disinvested from the emerging states there has been a fracturing of the national democratic movement and the workers organizations over contentious debates surrounding a way forward in an october report delivered at the world federation of trade unions wftu  th congress in durban south africa dr blade nzimande the secretary general of the south african communist party sacp placed these contradictions inside the national democratic revolution and the largest trade union federation the congress of south african trade unions cosatu within a broader context of the desire by the imperialist states to reverse the advances of the liberation struggles 
in a recent article published by the agence france press afp president zuma emphasized that western powers want to remove the anc because they do not want the anc to develop relations with those countries which helped the party in the antiapartheid struggle this statement was made by president zuma on nov  laid the blame directly on certain western countries which do not wish the ruling african national congress success 
zuma spoke to anc supporters at a rally in bushbuckridge mpumalanga province that the imperialist states were utilizing some anc members to further their agenda adding that some party members had been won over to the views of western countries the president said that those anc members calling for his resignation were in fact serving the interests of the western states 
the political economy of destabilization 
since  there have been substantial reforms initiated under the anc government there has been the construction of housing for the poor and working class the expansion of healthcare the breaking down of racial barriers in public facilities along with access to household utilities and clean drinking water 
however the fundamental relations and ownership of production remains under the control of the capitalist class as a manifestation of modernday capitalism high unemployment rising costs of living including education fees as well as problems associated with service delivery have continued 
in all other countries the majority controls everything from politics economy and defense    its only in this country south africa where we dont have economic freedom its controlled by the minority and those who oppressed us zuma stressed afp nov  
the president went on to say that is why they are scared that we will take away this economy they want to take away the strength of the anc because they know the anc is the only organization trying to balance the scales 
zuma said that his government would not break ties with longtime friends internationally in order to win the approval of the imperialist governments the president had also spoke at the wftu  th congress noting that the capitalist system would not relinquish concessions to the working class without demands based upon mass struggle 
recounting the history of the national liberation movement in south africa zuma said socialist countries like russia and china helped the anc giving it military training and aid during the antiapartheid struggle the socialist countries came to our aid it was russia who trained us and helped us with the tools to fight china and other socialist countries helped us 
in addition zuma said the western states are retaliating against the anc government due its affiliation with the brazil russia india china and south africa brics summit the advent of such blocs among the emerging states was a threat to western hegemony of the world economy 
they are fighting us because we joined brics some are in anc gear but are in the company of the west we are at war we are going to protect the anc zuma emphasized 
in an article published by the south african mail  guardian in reference to the stock values of holdings traded on the local market it noted should south africa avoid having its credit rating cut to junk in the next two weeks it could just be staving off the inevitable more than half of  economists surveyed by bloomberg said sp global ratings will strip the nation of its investmentlevel rating the median probability of south africa retaining its current assessment in december is  falling to only  in  the survey shows the economy faces a cut to junk on its foreigncurrency credit rating as output is forecast to expand at the slowest pace this year since a  recession delaying the governments plans to narrow the shortfall on the budget and rein in debt nov  
debate surrounds a national minimum wage amid allegation of regime change agenda 
the anc government has proposed the adoption of a national monthly minimum wage of  rand which is approximately  us dollars  percent of the working population earns less than this proposed amount bbc nov  
despite the possible introduction of such legislation it falls far short of what is actually needed to maintain a basic household prof chris malikane of the university of witwatersrand in johannesburg suggested that  rand per month was essential in maintaining a decent home bbc nov  
this issue is controversial among the business interests which claim that any significant governmentmandated increase in the minimum wage would create further unemployment which stands officially at around  percent over the last few years there have been largescale job losses in the mining sector which is impacting economic recovery 
two years ago cosatu proposed a minimum wage of  rand per month with inflation since  the amount would be at least  today 
deputy president cyril ramaphosa said the  rand per month figure was decided by a panel of experts ramaphosa said we are now a step closer to finalizing discussions on the national minimum wage all social partners will now decide what their take is bbc nov  
the anc must address the issues of joblessness poverty and service delivery in order to win back its twothirds majority electoral base inside the country local governmental elections which were held in august saw a decline in support for the ruling party by approximately ten points although it remains by far the most popular party in south africa winning  percent of the votes in the august poll 
a commission report issued several weeks ago alleged that the government of president zuma has been involved in corruption zuma has denied the charges and attempts to pass motions of noconfidence in parliament failed on numerous occasions the current anc leadership seems solidly committed to keeping zuma in office until his term expires in  
the party maintains that washington through its embassy in pretoria is pursuing a regimechange agenda party spokesperson zize kodwa stated in march they have taken about  young people to america to train them as part of their leadership program what we got from those young people is not what they expected they were trained on how to destabilize the country and regime change xinhua news agency march ",english,galacticconnection.com,No Image URL,bs,benjamin fulford full update spanish english october video,austrian schools evacuated radioactive rock none schools realized danger image credits marcin wicharyflickr twelve schools evacuated lump uranium found science classroom sparking nuclear terror discovery made antinuclear campaigner thomas neff giving lecture pupils old wristwatch radium dial numerals watch contain material help glow dark created little known damage caused radiation,1,

vitamin d is one of the most important vitamins you can give your body 
this vitamin can affect nearly  genes in your body and the best part of it is that you dont even need a supplement to get your full recommended amount of vitamin d  you only need to get out in the sun for a few minutes a day 
vitamin d is beneficial for staving off depression without the required amount of vitamin d in your diet or the necessary amount of time spent in the sun you can experience and excessively low mood and other signs of depression 
and one of the most wellknown and important benefits of vitamin d is the effect it has an calcium absorption and building healthy bones 
this is especially important for children as the vitamin helps with bone growth as well as developing strong teeth those who do not have enough vitamin d may find themselves at risk for fractures or soft bones 
thus vitamin d is not only important for children but also women who can be susceptible to brittle bones as they age 
the vitamin may also play a crucial role in helping your body ward off disease studies suggest that getting in enough vitamin d can help ward off multiple sclerosis heart disease and help your body steer clear of the dreaded flu 
if you dont get enough vitamin d you may find yourself feeling tired or experiencing general aches and pains if the deficiency is severe enough you may also find yourself developing stress fractures 
so how do you get enough vitamin d in your diet 
you can always purchase supplements most of which contain enough or in some cases more than enough of your daily recommended allowance 
it is also naturally found in salmon sardines egg yolk and shrimp milk cereal yogurt and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin d to ensure that you get the recommended amount 
for those who live in a sunny climate spending  minutes outside per day can actually give you the required amount of vitamin d although it is not advisable to spend too long outside without protection from the sun in the form of sun block or extra layers of clothing it is recommended that you do get outside for at least a small part of the day to soak up those rays 
you can however get all of the benefits of vitamin d in your diet or by taking supplements during the winter months when the sun takes a rest or if you happen to live in a colder climate newsletter

Mirror.co.uk,2016-10-26T21:37:22.918+03:00,austrian schools evacuated over radioactive rock,"the war against payday lending apple uses similar tactics with iphone jonathan lee  misesorg  october   comments image credits flickr khrawlings  
in june of  the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb put forward a proposal to regulate the shortterm loan industry 
the small dollar lending rule seeks to alleviate and solve for the apparent weaknesses of the current rates and shortterm lenders by requiring lenders to assess and verify a borrowers income housing costs and credit and legal obligations 
the intention of the proposal is to protect lowincome families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are forced to take out another loan to make ends meet at first glance it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its dirtiness except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their airconditioned offices away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of shortterm loans just the fact that they see the shortterm loan industry as dirty supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative 
instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the shortterm lending industry they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water 
in understanding the cfpb proposal for payday and other small loans a paper released by the cfpb and pew charitable trusts the bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation 
the first of its arguments is that with payday and vehicle title loan markets lenders and borrowers interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers but doesnt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product 
for example are the interests of iphone sellers and buyers aligned in the manner acceptable to the cfpb each additional iphone  is said to cost  to produce and is sold for  dollars that is  times its cost to make to borrow a phrase from the left thats pricegouging to the tune of  percent yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call apple a company that cheats its customers 
so why should shortterm lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than apple shouldnt shortterm lenders be able to charge interest rates that makeup for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to lowincome borrowers 
studies show these lenders charge on average  percent or  for every  loaned  a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets 
the second of the cfpbs arguments is that to solve for balloon payments or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans the cfpb would require that most products become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
the problem with this statement is that the bureau completely ignores the reason why shortterm loans are so available to borrowers  its because shortterm loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow 
simply put the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow additionally making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model making shortterm lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency 
the third of the cfpbs arguments is that their proposal would solve the problems related to price gouge lending by requiring lenders to evaluate borrowers financial condition by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income housing expenses all outstanding debt and child support meanwhile the lender is required to obtain a national credit report and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies 
remember all of these governmentimposed requirements cost the shortterm lenders money the cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates the result would either lead shortterm loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans 
lastly the cfpb heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by the pew charitable trusts survey research that the vast majority of borrowers want  most products to become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
at first glance it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance due to the risk of shortterm loans many of those surveyed actually sent in raving reviews in support of shortterm loans 
in fact more than  percent of the  submissions to the bureaus  tell your story  program  where people sent in their experiences regarding shortterm loans  were positive and excessively thankful for these loans 
these responses ranged from there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like this to a simple thank you this study was personally conducted by the cfpb unsatisfied with the results they hid it from the publics view until a freedom of information act request forced them to release it 
this holding back of information demonstrates that the bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help rather they have a keen eye for policy symbolism and the flash of fighting for the underdog when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back 
policymakers continue the belief that shortterm loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college or they simply want to be perceived as someone who cares but we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals we cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt instead we need to look at the coldhard facts the numbers that the cfpb uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false 
the small dollar lending rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back  it will only hurt the people it claims it will help let americans make decisions for themselves  theyre smarter and more riskaverse than washington insiders give them credit for

Astronomy,2016-10-26T21:37:32.328+03:00,there may be another planet in our solar system,"levers of power flushing the vote down the memory hole electronic election fraud exposed david knight  infowarscom  october   comments 
establishment politicians and press are outraged that trump would question the integrity of their system 
they say it undermines public trust in political institutions 
yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections who are shutting down election audit procedures who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony 
one such person is texas director of elections keith ingram 
this story is specific to texas but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting 
i went to the texas secretary of state offices to ask mr ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his  year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in august that would have gone into effect this november 
with camera  mic in hand we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the director about the election 
we were told to wait in the lobby and mr ingram would be down 
you can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with infowars 
the man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions 
so much for transparency and candor 
this unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law 
what follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in texas 
but before we get to specifics about his actions  his connection to the rose law firm in arkansas there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide 
 why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard 
 why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers  officials 
burning the paper trail 
in august  ingram texas director of elections attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming november  election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting his office issued new rules that would 
eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers 
eliminate printing of early voting results tapes 
eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts 
fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed with a formal public hearing scheduled after the november election 
state senator don huffines said the states chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more realtime paper records and backups not fewerthe comfort  convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters confidence and election integrity 
but even though these procedures have been postponed ingrams previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the november election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated here are some of the problems 
 waiver of laws requiring a partial manual recount audit 
ingram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in  of the election precincts or  election precincts whichever is greater this was waived in all  counties the day after the march  primary the timing is significant because during the primary there were  move votes than voters in hill county in the republican primary the margin of victory was  in texas house district  that contains hill county in calling for a criminal investigation ingram noted that it appears  or  voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures 
 waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes 
ingrams waivers issued in   and  appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws      and the judges handbook these rules require   three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates  on completion of the vote count the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct with total number of voters total number of votes with the presiding judge signing each of the  copies to certify 
ingram also issued waivers for requirements that a zero tape be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a tally tape printed at the close of election his letter states that the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day 
so expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections and if a favored vendor cant perform to the law the law is waived 
if proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state instead of waived by ingram the hill county issue of  more voters than votes would not have happened the vendor in hill county ess eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying an audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning early voting or election day ballotsthere are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error 
but the director of elections is waiving those established election protocols ingrams waver of legal requirements  his improvised solution of printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day opens the door for error and fraud 
 ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts 
the secretary of state election division claims that cast vote records are equivalent to ballot images as you can see the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered 
the texas constitution article   suffrage section  says in all elections by the people the vote shall be by ballot and the legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box 
yet the machines by vendors hart intercivic and ess certified by ingram do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and dont provide other components of a legal texas ballot 
 ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion 
texas election code sec  says a watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving 
affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in dallas county with official poll watcher signed forms detail how they were repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the dallas county central counting station such as ballot scanning vote transfer ballot transfer computer activities ballot tabulation and viewing the elections computer line printer they state that they were repeatedly treated disrespectfully obstructed and blatantly ignored by the election officials and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the texas secretary of state elections office 
hostility to election monitors like ingrams refusal to answer our questions destroy the publics confidence in the honesty of the process  and rightfully so 
ingrams connections to arkansas kutak rock rose law firm  hillary clinton 
according to a public information request of ingrams secretary of state personnel file ingram left private practice and moved to little rock arkansas taking a job with the law firm kutak rock ll at kutak rock he worked under the managing partner gordon miller wilbourn who had been a partner with hillary clinton vince foster and webster hubbell at the rose law firm in arkansas in the s the wilbourn family is a large donor to the clinton foundation and the hillary clinton campaign 
ingram left kutak rock to return to texas when he was hired by gov rick perrys appointment office in  to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts boards  commissions 
ingramss career moves are interesting in just  months his journey from private practice in texas through arkansas clintoncronies and back to texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half in  ingram was promoted to director of the election division in the texas secretary of states office where his salary was still  less than private practice 
ingrams determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big clinton donors 
establishment of both parties dont appear to want election integrity 
in one lawsuit contesting election results for austin city council the county could not produce any ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount computer logs had multiple corruptioninvalid errors during discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in  of the  precincts forming the district one precinct had  voter turnout another was just  registered voters shy of  in spite of only  and  countywide turnout in the general and runoff elections 
the county democrat party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities 
there are some positive developments however the republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly republican county and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by governor abbotts office 
state senator bob hall said due to an increasing number of complaints it is time for the texas elections division office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that officeand instruct all texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws 
voters regardless of political affiliation should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest transparent elections for example chambers county in texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected its time to remove keith ingram as texas director of elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sunlight.jpg,conspiracy,war payday lending,police investigate fraud voter registration flips republican democrat pennsylvania state police investigating voter manipulation image credits flickr dokidoki pennsylvania state police investigating couples claim political party affiliation fraudulently changed republican democrat voter registration applications pennsylvania state police investigating case fraud authorities noted press release tuesday date unknown actors filed fraudulent pennsylvania voter registration applications behalf victims yearold male yearold female town new ringgold schuylkill county application changed political affiliation republican democrat victims made aware changes schuylkill county office voter registration sent new voter registration cards infowars reached pennsylvania state police new updates stated currently actively investigating incident newsletter sign,1,

David Knight,2016-10-26T21:54:53.756+03:00,levers of power flushing the vote down the memory hole,"kurds worried turkey will stab them in the back as they fight isis turkey publicly opposes isis while supporting them behind the scenes image credits kurdish ypg fighters kurdishstruggle  
two months after being purged from the border town of jarablus in northern syria by a turkishled force  and just days after being targeted by turkish airstrikes near albab  syrian kurds now fear a stab in the back from turkeys military as plans for a usled push to clear isis fighters from raqqa are carried out 
it is very important raqqa is liberated a chief political leader of the main syrian kurdish party the pyd told reuters  but one point which is bothering us is that if we go toward raqqa we will be stabbed from the back 
at the end of august turkish forces took part in a usled operation to eject isis from the northern border of syria once inside syria however turkish forces  leading free syrian army fsa rebels  took aim at kurdish fighters in the town of jarablus which sent them scurrying across the euphrates river in retreat 
the issue here is that the us claims to find the kurds useful in the fight against isis the kurds in fact make up a significant portion of one of the primary ussupplied rebel forces in the region as reuters explains  
kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the syrian democratic forces sdf a usbacked umbrella group as it has seized large areas of territory from islamic state laying the ground for an assault on raqqa 
however turkeys intervention in syria in august in support of rebel groups fighting under the free syrian army fsa banner has complicated that equation leading to clashes between them and kurdish groups allied to the sdf 
the problem is one of trust turkey believes the kurdish militants are aligned with the kurdish pyd party which the turks believe is allied with kurds within turkey whove been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades 
so regardless of whether the us finds the kurds useful turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future in fact its taking a much more proactive stance than that 
last thursday in a campaign of airstrikes that were the heaviest against the ypg since turkey launched a military incursion into syria turkey targeted three kurdishcontrolled villages along the northern syrian border the turkish military later confirmed it had carried out  strikes on areas recently taken by the kurdish ypg militia and had killed between  and  combatants 
turkeys major concern is that kurdishcontrolled enclaves will physically unite thereby creating a de facto kurdish ministate along the turkish border as such turkey has warned kurds to keep out of towns like manjib which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in aleppo 
this tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the usled operation to purge isis from raqqa draws nearer in any case turkish president erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence  and the days of him obediently  even if somewhat grudgingly  bending to the us will appear to be fading as well 
from now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us erdogan said from his palace last week let them go wherever until we find and destroy them i am saying this very clearly they will not have a single place to find peace abroad newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Okeefe.jpg,conspiracy,police investigate fraud voter registration flips republican democrat,justice department releases guidelines controversial antihacking law several unsuccessful attempts reform law recent years image credits flickr skippy many conduct work research related digital security legislation meant protect computer crimes morphed something harmful law us computer fraud abuse act repeatedly described vague ineffectual allowing overzealous prosecutors saddle hacktivists lowlevel criminals excessive sentences thanks legal challenge cfaa department justice first time releasing guidelines prosecutors charge computer crimes someone exceeds authorized access computer first look media publisher intercept plaintiff case department justice acknowledges laws addressing misuse computers kept pace uniformly developments technology criminal schemes though maintains law remains important prosecuting cybercrimes prosecutions cfaa proved controversial aaron swartz wellknown internet activist downloaded academic journals en masse faced years grueling legal trials cfaa committed suicide andrew auernheimer found guilty conspiracy violate cfaa uncovering att customer data exposed company website,1,

last week the us state department acknowledged that alqaedalinked terror group jabhat alnusra is not a priority for the united states efforts in syria 
one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is 
state department spokesman john kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma stating 
the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar alassad and his supporters  we recognize alnusra as a spoiler we have concerns about comingling ive talked about this ad nauseam 
largely missing from the american narrative of the syrian conflict is that alnusra is shelling residential areas in aleppo where the government holds control of the majority of aleppos citizens in other parts of the world these alqaedalinked extremists are seen as the enemy whereas in syria western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups 
the united states first officially used the term war on terror on september   to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of september  the stated aim at the time was to defeat islamiclinked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the us government accused of supporting terrorism 
in  obama stated  
 we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror but rather as a series of persistent targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten america 
the fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the united states on american soil  is not a priority of the united states state department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is

to many who conduct work or research related to digital security the legislation meant to protect against computer crimes has morphed into something harmful the  law the us computer fraud and abuse act has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual  allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and lowlevel criminals with excessive sentences 
now thanks to a legal challenge to the cfaa the department of justice is for the first time releasing its  guidelines on how prosecutors should charge computer crimes  when someone exceeds authorized access on a computer first look media the publisher of the intercept is a plaintiff in the case

daniel fernandez suggested this in his article  has china reached its debt limit  in mises wire  in response to the governments monetary expansion stimulus plan after the  financial crisis chinas corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector however in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective using the same data source as used by fernandez we find that chinas total debt as a percentage of gdp was  percent by the end of  debttogdp ratio of corporate government and household sectors stood at  percent  percent and  percent respectively 
for government and household sectors both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a fourtrillion yuan rmb stimulus plan in  government debttogdp ratio which was kept in the mid s in the first decade of this millennium now stood at  percent by the end of  households debttogdp ratio was at  percent in  and almost doubled to  percent in  and then doubled again to  percent by the end of  the leveraging up of households happened exactly as the chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its  stimulus 
apart from the demand for urban housing chinese households with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation furthermore as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending household debt increased dramatically however we must note that although the debt growth rate was high the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers 
the most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector with the debttogdp ratio increased from approximately  percent prior to  to  percent by the end of  first of all the level of corporate debt mostly in the form of bank loans was high to start with but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector whose funding source is mostly deposits two figures from jonathan andersons how to think about china series provide some insights  
an international comparison of assets of banking system vs domestic saving rate 
breakdown of assets of chinas financial system 
this point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures for example between the us and china obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in china whereas in the us the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily 
financial asset structure us vs china  
data source the world bank federal reserve bank shanghai stock exchange shenzhen stock exchange china central deposit and clearing co ltd ccdc sifma 
it is therefore not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to governments stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system chinas flat yield curve 
the large role of the banks can also be seen in chinas bond market yields and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve  the reason for this is simple deposits when banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields this investment strategy or assetliability management scheme bids up the bond prices on the long end hence pushing down the longterm yields 
in addition between allocating deposits to these two types of assets bonds vs loans banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds rather than lending due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand credit risks market liquidity and yields that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early  so the yield spread at current stage reflects more of the combination of chinas financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals as the government flooded the market with four trillion rmb from the stimulus plan in  bond yields faced downward pressure more so at the longterm end please see the yields of chinese government treasury bonds at maturity  years vs  year and the spread thereof in the below figure wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of bankingsector supervision in form of trusts for example but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner 
data source wind ccdc 
china didnt open up to the outside world until the very late s now china provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around  percent obviously a good part of chinas production structure has been configured to export mostly to the developed economies which are dominated by the service sector as the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum china faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers which stands at  times the number of us consumers this reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities but to me this is more of a textbook case of austrian economics at work capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market and this takes time moreover quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than  years ago so that chinese consumers dont have to go to japan to buy hitech toilet lids  a healthier skepticism of stimulus 
needless to say the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue ultimately whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post  stimulus phase is a function of how fast the chinese government runs the money printing press a recent article on the peoples daily  the mouthpiece of china communist party ccp  quoted the diagnosis from an authoritative figure on the chinese economy and its cure this authoritative figure suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate comparing with its own historical average of  percent anyone with an understanding of chinas political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of chinese leadership this can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years 
the xinhua news agency the mainstream media group recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world how chinas policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media in addition a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced and the central government is pushing hard for businessfriendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom 
china has its problems tons of them china may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises as many people say no matter whichever the case i am more convinced that china will be among the first ones to revive  because it has high savings to invest it has a welltrained labor force with one of the most vibrant if not the most complete manufacturing chain and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over  percent of its gdp it is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process it is not yet a welfare state chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises china has the biggest potential market of  billion people with a rising middleclass that is still increasing in numbers and share in population serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the st century

Mikael Thalen,2016-10-27T01:10:18.435+03:00,exstate dept employee sending sensitive info to private email norm under clinton,"get ready for civil unrest survey finds that most americans are concerned about election violence time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it michael snyder  economic collapse  october   comments 
could we see violence no matter who wins on november th lets hope that it doesnt happen but as you will see below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation 
if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton  if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country 
at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day 
a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that 
more than four in  of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square 
but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax 
donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first 
and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  
this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day 
we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika 
there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece 
on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement 
around oct  a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt 
on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope 
there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating 
of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge 
for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election 
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president 
walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for trump on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in 
and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today  
since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election 
today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another 
ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   
if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then 
and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  
as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be 
but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  
out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house 
perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it newsletter sign up",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChinaStock4.jpg,conspiracy,breaking google youtube caught censoring bill clintons son,store guardian front page yearold migrant cries image yearold migrant crying currently plastered front page guardian nothing short laughable chris menahan information liberation october comments wont take pity poor innocent little child image yearold migrant crying currently plastered front page guardian nothing short laughable yearold ethiopia cries awaits registration processing centre makeshift refugee camp near calais photos caption reads image placed headline reading councils resist pressure take children calais crying child supposed make brits feel guilty demand government allow children like nation image fake used satirically comes associated press emilio morenatti see four pictures man sale website child migrant clearly yet editors evidently believe readers incredibly stupid theyll actually believe theyre looking yearold boy look emilios twitter shows one person appears actually bought lie morenatti imposible hacernos mirar luego un nudo en la garganta pictwittercomazvzq luján artola paulos rowley_bel october impossible make us look lump throat tweet reads incidentally ethiopia even war zone im sure yearold man even considered refugee newsletter sign,1,

i say the following you have been covering me for the last  long time i did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches and ive been doing this for weeks straight trump responded 
for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps and yet youll ask me that question i think thats a very rude question to be honest with you trump exclaimed 
trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit 
while cnn has continuously run defense for hillary clinton amid a myriad of scandals and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates the network has been forced to admit that hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule

Kit Daniels,2016-10-27T18:25:45.168+03:00,podesta who told hillary she could use private email,"three quarters of americans oppose gun control record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban steve watson  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

china has experienced such a growth rate of hiv in the past several years that one university has taken steps to allow students to test themselves by placing an hiv testing kit in a vending machine next to regular fare like snacks 
china has seen a  yearoveryear increase in infection rates which likely prompted southwest petroleum university in nanchong city in sichuan province to install the test kits  
sichuan province is one of the top three provinces in china with a disproportionately high rate of hivaids together with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease the three account for over half of the cases of hivaids in the entire country 
 of new hiv cases occur due to homosexual activity 
the kits retail for  and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory and then access the results online this can all be done completely anonymously 
similar kits can be purchased online but they retail for around  the cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible 
reports state that the chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about hiv or aids many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality those who do have hiv are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with samesex encounters 
the disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men but as with anywhere else women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected 
doctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with hivaids in china lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention 
the joint united nations programme on hivaids unaids states that there are currently about half a million people in china living with hiv or aids however this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bushmaster-constitution-gun.jpg,conspiracy,wikileaks email clinton operative thinks black voters stupid,usled coalition killed civilians air strikes syria amnesty international report finds group calls authorities come clean full extent casualties damage image credits bbc least civilians killed air strikes usled coalition report found amid concern families trapped isis stronghold mosul amnesty international urged pentagon allies come clean full extent deaths operations socalled islamic state official inquiries far acknowledging dozens casualties assessing reports ground eyewitness interviews satellite imagery photos video footage investigators said us central command centcom may failed take necessary precautions spare civilians carried unlawful attacks syria coalition attacks reviewed amnesty include strikes operations drive isis manbij summer civilians including children reportedly killed villages altukhar alhadhadh alghandoura homes market,1,

The Alex Jones Show,2016-10-27T18:54:59.921+03:00,hillary is a real christian says michael moore,"public faith in elections falls as the state grows outofcontrol state power ryan mcmaken  misesorg  october   comments 
in the wake of the final presidential election debate last week the mainstream media was appalled that donald trump would not preemptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election  
trumps position reflects a growing faction of americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the american electoral system in response mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth  
while rarely stated explicitly the way american electoral politics is supposed to work is this the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes horrible ideas and gross incompetence each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers then once the votes are cast everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results ignore everything that was said during the campaign and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone including the sizable minority  or even the majority in many cases  who either voted against the winner or abstained if there appears to be any irregularities in the vote well those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election if half the country feels its been cheated well tough luck and better luck next time democracy breaks down as perceived interventionism increases 
this model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions it can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare it can also work in a small culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socioeconomic and ethnic groups 
in the case of the united states however it appears that neither of these conditions apply 
in the age of presidential executive orders militarized police uncountable federal laws and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch americans every move gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question the president says he can issue laws with  a pen and  a phone  without any need to consult congress the libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in congress meanwhile the untouchable supreme court hands down decisions that are equivalent to constitutional amendments some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens 
in other words the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant the fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing 
this situation is further complicated by the fact that the united states is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socioeconomic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography many of these different groups distrust each other and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses democracy can work when the stakes are low 
contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives the united states was never united into a single cultural linguistic or socioeconomic group those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century but they were far larger in the th century than they are today 
when you have a diverse population however the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in australia  ludwig von mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides could a laissezfaire regime be guaranteed to all residents of australia mises notes it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between englishdescended australians and asian newcomers however since laissezfaire liberalism has not been embraced a familiar problem presented itself 
the present inhabitants of australia fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which for instance the germans are today ie the early s exposed in czechoslovakia italy and poland 
it cannot be denied that these fears are justified because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality as long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying it is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution  masquerading under the guise of justice  by a ruling majority it is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority 
it is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity or to that of the socialist state only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration which today seems insoluble completely disappear in an australia governed according to liberal principles what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent japanese and in other parts englishmen were in the majority 
these same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well the existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group with the help of state power change the term nationality to political party or interest groups and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state 
in the presence of a relatively weak government however these concerns are often overstated at the turn of the th century in the us for example the fact that spanishspeakers were in the majority in new mexico and many areas of the american west was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of americans the fact that japanese immigrants and their descendant were outcompeting white businessmen in california was simply not a matter of national importance the fact that oregon attempted to outlaw catholic schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard 
voters have always feared losses in elections but now more than ever the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity when that is the case elections are not something to be taken lightly trumps remarks about rigged elections  and public fears over the outcome  are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of outofcontrol state power 
in response to all of this the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy and that elections  specifically federal ones are sacred rituals never to be questioned there will be a double standard of course a trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians but in that case it will be the fault of the russians  and not anything wrong with the system itself the solution for the feds of course will be a federal takeover of the election system if clinton wins then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all to question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege 
the true solution to the problem remains far more practical however to paraphrase mises it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state so long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side faith in the electoral system will erode and the potential for real violence will increase newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/syria-bombing.jpg,conspiracy,monopoly banks media voting machine companies,cancer agency fire withholding carcinogenic glyphosate documents iarc urged scientists publish research documents weedkiller glyphosate review rtcom october comments international agency research cancer iarc facing criticism classification carcinogens reportedly advising scientific experts publish internal research data report probably carcinogenic glyphosate iarc urged scientists publish research documents weedkiller glyphosate review according reuters agency told reuters tuesday tried protect study external interference well protect intellectual rights since sole owner materials scientists asked earlier release documentation report us freedom information laws groundbreaking review published march iarc semiautonomous agency world health organization labeled glyphosate herbicide probably carcinogenic humans glyphosate key ingredient monsantos flagship weedkiller wellknown trade name roundup one heavily used herbicides world designed go along geneticallymodified roundup ready crops also produced monsanto iarcs report caused problems notorious agrochemical giant agency report sparked heated debate around use roundup caused several eu countries including france sweden netherlands object renewal glyphosates eu license vote prolonging glyphosate license years failed several times june license temporarily extended months last hours expiration controversial report seemingly made iarc target attacks multiple directions raised scientific legal financial questions various critics including chemical industry said iarcs evaluations fuel unnecessary health scares since iarc allegedly studies potentially harmful substance typical human exposure remained unclear whether critics urged body test potentially carcinogenic chemical humans critics also brought controversial statements iarc whether things mobile phones coffee red meat processed meat could cause cancer agency defended methods scientifically sound widely respected scientific rigor standardized transparent process andfreedom conflicts interest numerous freedom information requests energy environment legal institute ee legal us conservative advocacy group since turned reasoning ee legal told reuters pushing legal challenge whether documents question belong iarc us federal state institutions experts work basically decided whether iarc part truly independent free conflicts interest according reuters officials us national institutes health nih questioned congressional committee american taxpayers fund cancer agency faces much criticism allegedly faulty classification carcinogens iarcs standards determinations classifying substances carcinogenic therefore cancercausing appear inconsistent scientific research generated much controversy alarm letter us oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz nih director francis collins states quoted reuters oversight committee demanded full disclosure nih funding iarc even money spent relation cancer agencys activities iarc opponents scientific circles vowed provide data matter european food safety authority efsa believes glyphosate unlikely pose carcinogenic hazard humans promised release raw data subject part commitment open risk assessment food safety watchdog made statement late september still deliver promised information newsletter sign get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles,1,

Kelen M,2016-10-28T00:15:48.279+03:00,monopoly banks then media now voting machine companies,"who cancer agency under fire for withholding carcinogenic glyphosate documents iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its  weedkiller glyphosate review rtcom  october   comments 
the international agency for research on cancer iarc facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its  report on probably carcinogenic glyphosate 
the iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its  weedkiller glyphosate review according to reuters the agency told reuters on tuesday that it tried to protect the study from external interference as well as protect its intellectual rights since it was the sole owner of such materials 
the scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the  report under us freedom of information laws 
the groundbreaking review published in march  by the iarc  a semiautonomous agency of the world health organization who  labeled the glyphosate herbicide as probably carcinogenic to humans glyphosate is a key ingredient of monsantos flagship weedkiller wellknown under the trade name roundup it is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with geneticallymodified roundup ready crops also produced by monsanto 
the iarcs report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself 
the report sparked a heated debate around the use of roundup and caused several eu countries  including france sweden and the netherlands  to object to the renewal of the glyphosates eu license the vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for  years failed several times in june  but the license was temporarily extended for  months during last hours before its expiration 
the controversial report has seemingly made the iarc a target for attacks from multiple directions and raised scientific legal and financial questions 
various critics including those in the chemical industry said the iarcs evaluations are fuel for unnecessary health scares since the iarc allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself and not a typical human exposure to it it remained unclear whether the critics urged a who body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans 
the critics also brought up other controversial statements from the iarc over whether such things as mobile phones coffee red meat and processed meat could cause cancer 
the agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and widely respected for their scientific rigor standardized and transparent process andfreedom from conflicts of interest numerous freedom of information requests by the energy  environment legal institute ee legal a us conservative advocacy group have since been turned down with this reasoning 
ee legal told reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the iarc or to the us federal and state institutions where some of the experts work basically its being decided whether the iarc as part of the who is truly independent and free from conflicts of interest 
according to reuters officials from the us national institutes of health nih will be questioned by a congressional committee about why american taxpayers fund the cancer agency which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens 
iarcs standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic and therefore cancercausing appear inconsistent with other scientific research and have generated much controversy and alarm a letter from us oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz to nih director francis collins states as quoted by reuters 
the oversight committee demanded a full disclosure of nih funding of the iarc and even money spent in relation to the cancer agencys activities 
iarc opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter the european food safety authority efsa which believes glyphosate is unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its commitment to open risk assessment the food safety watchdog made this statement in late september and still has to deliver the promised information newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",english,infowars.com,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/041116electioncancelled.jpg,conspiracy,ignoring law rig elections,illegal immigrants crossing border vote foreigners worried trump presidency alex jones show october comments even mainstream dinosaur media forced report flood immigrants crossing border influencing presidential election newsletter sign get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew related articles download mobile device free today show get latest breaking news specials alex jones infowars crew store featured videos expert trump already election see rest alex jones youtube channel democrats plan burn us trump elected see rest alex jones youtube channel illustration much healthcare premiums rise infowarscom free speech systems llc company rights reserved digital millennium copyright act notice flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce brain force flip switch supercharge state mind brain force next generation neural activation infowars life httpwwwinfowarscomwpcontentuploadsbrainforceejpg httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce httpwwwinfowarsstorecomhealthandwellnessinfowarslifebrainforcehtmlimstzrwuutm_campaigninfowarsplacementutm_sourceinfowarscomutm_mediumwidgetutm_contentbrainforce,1,

dementia is one of the most common and debilitating illnesses that older americans face today

by   in  americans will suffer from alzheimers alzheimers is the most potent form of dementia and often ends in the patient unable to remember how to do daily and necessary tasks like eating or using the restroom this will rival the current diabetes and obesity crises seen today 
recent studies have confirmed that a variety of environmental factors are at play when it comes to dementia 
doctors have noted that those who are deficient in vitamin d are  more likely to develop dementia than those who get in the necessary amount 
a vitamin d deficiency can also be associated with brittle or soft bones as well as depression it is recommended that everyone gets at least  minutes of sunlight per day in order to ensure they have enough vitamin d as well as eat fortified dairy products or salmon liver and red meat vitamin d can also be obtained through supplementation or fish oil 
however doctors have found that the biggest environmental risk for dementia lies in air pollution 
in fact the problem is so great that those who live in a city with high pollution can double their risk of develop dementia within  or  months living there 
recent studies have also shown that postmortem examinations of the brains of those who have lived in highly polluted areas contain traces of magnetite this chemical compound may be partially responsible for the memory impairments associated with dementia 
the risk of developing dementia if you are exposed to air pollution increases exponentially if you are obese 
researchers say that those concerned about the epidemic can combat it by living somewhere with as little pollution as possible maintaining a health intake of vitamin d and exercising 
according to research exercise is imperitive when it comes to staving off the illness dr laura baker who ran a study on dementia and exercise stated

julian assange has claimed the hillary clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by wikileaks 
despite the ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the us election is over the website will continue publishing according to assange 
everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday 
the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october 
assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
 they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added 
ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador 
he said he was sympathetic with ecuador insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month 
assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform 
he also attacked us tv networks many of whom he accused of being controlled by clinton supporters 
the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result according to assange i dont think theres any chance of donald trump winning the election even with the amazing material we are publishing because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton he said

infowars has exclusively learned that the email account of colorado democratic senator andy kerr has been hacked 
the emails shown to infowars by the website dcleaks include hundreds of discussions from march  to july   with one email concerning  marijuana legislation oddly claiming to be from december of  
taken from kerrs gmail account the emails which are currently password protected mostly surround requests and comments by kerrs constituents on a wide range of political topics 
speaking with infowars david pourshoushtari communications director for the colorado state senate democrats said kerr was unaware of the hack but that the senator declined to provide an official statement until the situation could be assessed 
while the exact reasoning behind the hack is currently unknown kerr may have been targeted as part of the same hacking campaign that compromised the emails of other political figures including clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
it is also unclear whether kerr like podesta fell victim to a phishing attack that would have resulted in the senator putting his email password into a fake google login page 
earlier this month the former chief of protocol of the united states capricia marshall who was one of clintons insiders at the state department similarly had her emails appear on dcleaks

in another example of poll rigging an abc presidential poll surveyed  more democrats than republicans and showed hillary clinton leading by   with a  sampling error 
abc claims its a point race with clinton ahead after polling a random national sample of  likely voters but the polls methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of hillary 
results have a margin of sampling error of  points including the design effect partisan divisions are  percent democratsrepublicansindependents abc said near the bottom of the poll 
of course hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by democrats but abc and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters wont bother to look at a polls methodology to find the bias 
even if theres more registered democrats than republicans nationally they dont outnumber them by nearly  because otherwise republicans wouldnt be winning national races 
these kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters wrote media analyst aaron rossiter they seem to want the big hillary lead probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress republican voter turnout 
and if the fact that mainstream polls are adjusted to manufacture a hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you just read this leaked email from democratic consultant tom matzzie

youtube has decided to reverse its ban on a channel registered by a man who claims to be bill clintons longlost son 
your youtube account was suspended due to repeated or severe violations of our terms and our community guidelines and as such cannot be restored the company wrote earlier this week to danney williams after he filed an appeal to restore his channel 
for decades williams has been on a mission to reunite with the person he believes to be his biological father the nd president of the united states william jefferson clinton 
the most popular video on the channel  a nineminute minidocumentary posted two weeks ago produced by filmmaker joel gilbert features the yearold williams recounting memories from his childhood which prompted the search for his father 
arguing the channel had absolutely zero violations of any kind gilbert places blame for the suspension squarely at google and the clinton campaigns feet 
its obvious to me that the fix is in gilbert wrote in a statement the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danny to run him off the plantation as danny said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  
youtube later restored williams channel early thursday morning claiming a review confirmed it was not in violation of its terms of service

why does everyone think that presidential campaigns are about issues when anyone over the age of consent knows they are all about sex but it says a lot about the lasting power of viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventyyearolds on the ballot  for an election lasting more than four years please call your doctor  
in last weeks newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman i have lost track to come forward to say that donald trump made suggestive and inappropriate advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago 
the woman in question is jessica drake who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament she was working in the the adult industry thats what people magazine calls porn for wicked pictures the th century fox of gang banging when the randy donald kissed and hugged her in his room 
trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door together with two friends normally in the adult business when three porn stars knock on your hotel door its considered foreplay 
when trumps effusive greeting of miss drake did not lead to more snuggling let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television he offered her  to satisfy his suite dreams 
drake again demurred saying that the next morning she needed to get back to los angeles for work by that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for extreme doggie and fornocopia i would mention other titles but as they say at the new york post  this is a family newspaper 
that rejection prompted donald to offer jessica an early morning ride of shame on his trump airliner back to la which still didnt turn the trick    
then last week in the presence of her lawyer gloria allred the perry mason of many cases against bill cosby miss drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that mr trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation which after all includes the  adult video news award for the best double penetration sex scene in her classic work fallen 
drake said she was coming forward now to stand in solidarity with the other women trump has manhandled although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of drakes new online store where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her guide to bdsm for beginners among other titles 
normally scenes such as the one i am describing would be consigned to john oliver monty python or saturday night live  but in the new normal of presidential politics even miss drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues 
for example the next day the huffington post reported woman says trump sexually assaulted her offered her  for sex 
the deadpan new york times wrote ms drake who appeared saturday with the womens rights lawyer gloria allred said mr trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission 
the headline in new york magazine read adult actress jessica drake details trump assault blasts him for uncontrollable misogyny 
look i have no doubt that trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the adult industry    
sadly the answer to this question dates to winter  when bill and hillary clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform 
during the  super bowl the clintons appeared on a halftime special of  minutes to deny jointly bill that allegation is false  that he had ever had an affair with gennifer flowers who lived in little rock arkansas when bill was governor and often out jogging 
in this vaudeville performance hillary played the straight man adding you know im not sitting heresome little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette at least she didnt reference the eagles 
only in  under oath in a sworn deposition did bill admit to having a year affair with ms flowers but neither her allegations in  nor his lying about it cost him the election that year 
just the opposite clintons wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters no strangers to sexual boredom who found they had more in common with a softshell baptist bill than an uptight protestant george hw bush 
nor did clintons impeachment in  for lying about his affair with monica lewinsky under oath in the paula jones case hurt his postpresidential career worth  million  or the electoral prospects of his wife in  
but it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue which is one of the reasons why this years race seems only to be about sex    
no doubt the clintons do find some delicious irony in trumps groping charges as payback for what they view as the republican use of sexuality to impeach bill in  and in  for the gop plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites cut to an online image of the white house and over it a fading picture of bill smoking a cigar with the caption here we go again 
without the pageantloving casino operating donald trump as the republican nominee in  hillary clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front with bills mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that hillary organized the slutshaming 
instead of the  election turning on hillarys marriage to hugh hefners doppelgänger the storyline that has played best in the media is donalds secret life as a groper 
the press actually has given trump a pass for his adultery which produced all those wonderful children but zeroed in on his groping in part because he confessed to it on an nbc videotape and also becausethink of ratingsgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways crowed elevators or near schoolyards 
best of all for the clintons politically anyway is that the charge of groping is impossible for trump to refute even denying it sounds sleazy 
and it colors all aspects of the campaign to wit the new york times headline when at gettysburg trump outlined his vision for america donald trump pledges to heal divisions and sue his accusers    
for its mudslinging i am sure the trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar hillary as a lesbian but even that innuendo has fallen flat despite the rumor mongering that shes in a boston marriage with her assistant huma abedin whose husband anthony weiner is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms 
several of bills former lovers sally miller dolly kyle and flowers have tried to play up bills pillow talk that hillary prefers the nighttime company of women but none of these allegations have gone further than infowars or the supermarket press  hillary hit man tells all  
nor have outofwedlock children a staple of the  campaign as was chanted to grover cleveland  ma ma where  s my pa  gotten much play in this years presidential race 
trump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that danney williams is bill clintons illegitimate son by a little rock prostitute named bobbie ann williams 
trump invited danney a sympathetic man to the third presidential debate as if to press on bill a scarlet letter despite williams looking very much like president bill the story got no more traction than did the news that malik obama the presidents shunned halfbrother is supporting trump he too got a debate invitation to sit in the box presumably marked shame 
also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that flowers aborted bills baby in  and the whispering campaign a great political standby when proof is elusive that chelsea is the product of an affair between hillary and her then law firm colleague webb hubbell 
the williams and hubbell stories come with some convincing internet similarities at least in the photographs although in both cases politically this rumor milling whiplashed against trump as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his birther past something that has stuck as campaign mud    
technically birtherism doest directly involve sex although it lingers on its fringes as it speaks to barack obamas illegitimacy his foreign allegiances and possibly disputed paternity including the claim that frank marshall davis was actually obamas biological father another subterranean creed of trumpism 
again the documentary proof is a series of lookalike photographs as close as the internet gets to dna that davis was an american communist works well in the campaign as it suggests the origins of obamas political genetic code 
ironically for all his efforts at smear trump came out the loser in the debates when hillary nailed him to birtherism which has become a convenient code word for trumps racism misogyny and intolerance of immigrants especially muslims 
nor in response did trump have any luck in linking the birther movement to clintons  campaign when according to donald consiglierejournalist sidney blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that barack was born in kenya 
instead the debate claim only made trump look disingenuous clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in  and at this point no one cares but voters do remember trump as the imperial wizard of birtherism    
republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in  along lines of sexual preference or deviance although this strategy was based on hillary being the democratic nominee and anyone other than trump standing for the republicans 
had the gop nominee been carly fiorina jeb bush or john kasich clinton inc might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity illegitimacy and rape cue up the paula jones description of bill during a business meeting exposing himself in a little rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for  
instead the republicans went with the polyamorous trump who in addition to three marriages has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since  has been leering at miss universe contestantsa bit like austin powers  shall we shag now or shall we shag later  
with trumps resumé of creepy perversion you might have thought that the republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook instead they doubled down to make the case that both clintons if elected would turn the white house into a strip club 
not only did the clintons shrug off such innuendo but in response they said in effect if they did it would be to cater to the likes of players such as donald j trump leisure suit and open collar optional    
for the momentand i cant see anything changing in the last days of the campaignthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that donald trump has groped as many women as tiger woods has watched pole dancing in vegas even the gallery of their women looks about the same 
conversely few voters seem to care that bill might have forced himself on several women or that hillary helped to cover up his brutality thats a narrative of the s which is perhaps the last time austin danger trump read the newspaper  ive been frozen for  years ive got to see if my bits and pieces are still working  
for most voters in  names such as kathleen willey or juanita broaddrick are as lost in time as nan britton who just before the  election bore a love child with then candidate senator warren harding 
britton and the child got republican hush money and a sad little house in asbury park new jersey after harding won she was invited to the white house but their affair so to speak was kept in the closet    
if you think about elections as political sitcoms in  the kennedys had to run as rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke show  complete with twin beds long flannel pajamas and prudent kisses on the cheek to say goodnight even if the jfk reality show would make trump bill clinton and tiger look like apprentices at adultery 
come  only something that resembles modern family and a desperatehousewives reality show can crack network primetime and who better to put on air than the clintons with their dallas like money communal sexuality and more illicit storylines than csi  
for more than twenty years bill and hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust affairs ididnothavesexwiththatwoman vince foster travelgate foundation slush funds basement servers commodity trading whitewater bosnian snipers paytoplay benghazi lost emails and the like and the ratings only continue to go up

this fall the us agreed to provide  billion in military aid to israel over the next ten years ensuring americas continued role in funding the occupation of palestine meanwhile my friends and colleagues here in gaza live in fear of another significant israeli attack in the near future 
they have every reason to fear another major escalation  violence is a daily reality in gaza in two recent incidents a rocket was fired from gaza into israel without causing damage or injuries and in both instances israel responded by bombing targets throughout gaza 
in august alone israel bombed more than  locations in the small territory  
the simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction palestinians attacked israel with a rocket and israel responded we hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort but its woefully incomplete 
in both instances the rockets fired werent fired by hamas but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with hamas which governs gaza these groups seek to incite israeli attacks on hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over gaza because they see hamas as too comfortable with the status quo 
since seizing power in  hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory outside of periods of defined military escalation  which tend to be precipitated by israeli attacks  they have effectively stopped attacks against israel from gaza 
this explains why as noted by the israeli press there were only  rockets fired from gaza towards israel between january and august this year none were fired by hamas so israels decision to target hamas as a response makes no sense 
of course  rockets fired from gaza is  too many for those of us committed to ending all violence and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by hamas 
but as the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in the occupied palestinian territories reports  there were also  israeli military incursions into gaza this year resulting in  palestinian deaths and on average injuring five palestinians in gaza every week 
this is the part of the story that isnt told 
gaza also remains under an israeliimposed blockade that severely limits travel trade and life for gazans despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the  hamasisrael ceasefire agreement the blockade remains in effect 
israel with support from the us government claims this decadeslong blockade is in place to pressure the people of gaza to rise up against hamas and provide security for israelis 
if those are israels raisons detre then its a complete failure it hasnt stopped violence it hasnt weakened hamas and it hasnt brought israelis or palestinians security 
while the blockade hasnt succeeded in achieving the changes israel claims to be seeking its impact on the civilian population of gaza has been immense 
over two years after the end of the last large military operation there much of gaza remains in ruins 
of the  palestinians in gaza who were displaced during the  israeli bombardment over  remain homeless as  percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed havent been rebuilt this is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering gaza 
this important context is too often missing as us pundits and politicians consider the situation in gaza 
given the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by israel the firing of less than  rockets per month by palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence 
if the us is serious about promoting peace between israelis and palestinians preventing future violence in gaza and guaranteeing security then it must recognize the violence inherent in the israeli occupation and end the blockade 
the next attack on gaza feared by my friends who live there is an inevitable reality if nothing changes

Admin,2016-10-27T21:15:44.654+03:00,swedish mp quits in disgust at jewish ownership of media  includes short video by red ice radio,"by m jaggers ld we discussed yesterday the various reasons why trump won the election mr jaggers thinks trump won because he promoted the interests of the vast underclass of disenfranchised whites who were sick to death of the neoconservative liberal elites as typified by the loathsome hillary clinton it is in trumps own interests jaggers believes not to betray the whites who voted for him by reneging on his promises there must be no uturns no cuddling up to the zionist enemy no wishywashy compromises or backslidings trump is now expected to make america great again  or else a tall order well see ld 
 in certain times there is a surreal feeling of being a part of history which is perhaps to say we are living in a time period of dynamic change however unthinkable for the left it may be trump has been elected we can add this to brexit and other unthinkable events to come to contemplate the details of what this may entail such as the selection of cabinet members and policy priorities  which do indeed include building that wall has something of a christmas morning feelingeveryday 
to paraphrase an from die welt  in western democracies the status quo seems stable and it is not generally considered possible for extremes to transpire but that is what we have seen however we may want to quibble about what exactly is extreme can donald trump or the altright for that matter be considered extreme after that electoral show of consent regardless when there is an endless back and forth between stultifying uncourageous republicans and the frankly antiwhite agenda of the democrats extreme does not carry such a negative connotation but instead implies a kind of deliverance 
we have been locked in a middleclass complaisance and that is precisely why societies such as ours are often surprised by the foreseeable and obvious and alas though it may be unspeakable to liberals and though he was the object of such ridicule in our media trump is now the most powerful man in the world as die welt puts it perhaps with some apprehension just let that sink in explanatory factors 
trumps appeal may have been equally a reaction to black lives matter protests as to immigration according to exit polls  percent of trump voters feel that blacks are treated fairly by the criminal justice system which by definition means that these voters are not sympathetic to black lives matter overall half of white voters democrats and republicans opined that blacks are treated fairly by police likely most of us will have anecdotal evidence that our nonaltright family members and acquaintances were not amused by black lives matter trump voters were especially unamused 
of trump supporters  percent favor building the wall on the southern border compared to less than half of all voters  percent oppose  percent favor so antipathy towards both black lives matter and immigration can be said to have catapulted trump to the presidency  in part by turning off mainstream middleclass white people who are normally content with the statusquo moderates may not want a wall per se  but they also may not complain too loudly when its being built and again trumps actual voters want it builtunequivocally 
while losing some steam amongst collegeeducated whites trump won the white working class by  points  an increase from romneys  point spread ultimately there is no simple narrative that emerges trump increased white support in different key swing states from different rural and suburban demographics in order to dominate the electoral college i wont pretend to be nate silver so lets just say he won because of white people 
among his supporters opines thomas friedman on real time with bill maher  this was  percent about race and the other  percent was about race 
good then lets accept the premise of liberals and draw the necessary conclusions if trump triumphed on the basis of race issues he now has a mandate on immigration law and order the wall etc 
for the nytimes david brooks holding forth on public broadcasting service pbs trump voters are just going with their gene pool  a rather bald statement that trump voters are voting their ethnic interests after the election brooks predicted that the country would be split into two factions with one faction advocating ethnic separatism what many on the alt right are already advocating would that it were so 
nixon became known to history as the law and order candidate which accurately characterized his proclivities visàvis crime trump on the other hand to leave no doubt selfidentified as the law and order candidate as liberals will complain and as the altright will readily admit law and order is understood to mean that we will not tolerate black violence and civil unrest trumps support therefore was premised on his intolerance for the very violence which his election has provoked once again from blacks and other malcontent minorities in the protests following his victory which continue as i write this 
it is ironic that blacks report feeling scared at the prospect of the trump presidency while they are in fact the progenitors of violence and so far as i know trump never made any negative statements explicitly about blacks their violence and disorder has indeed scared the rest of civil society contributing to trumps election perhaps blacks are expressing their fear by attacking innocent whites in this inverted reality how can we assuage these sensitive blacks sense of fear shall we become human punching bags you cant always get what you want 
if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory 
some journalists noted with amusement that trump often played the rolling stones you cant always get what you want at his campaign rallies i hypothesized that trump liked the song for its beautiful choral section which has a celestial quality that built anticipation for his arrival on stage surely he paid little heed to the message of the lyrics which discordantly seemed to suggest he was voters second choice but now it all makes sense i suggest that for our underprivileged people of color its time you learned you cant always get what you want 
not only is the people of color poc attitude of entitlement and aggrievement ridiculous it is also presumptuous 
while the msm claims that the onus is now on trump to reach out to those who didnt vote for him ie blacks and hispanics it would seem that he was given a mandate to serve the interests of those who did vote for him  it follows logically that he would now carry that project through and enact the policies which mobilized his base and put him in the oval office sourced from the occidental observer like this share it now  thoughts on  trump won because of white people  györgy says november   at  am 
you cant always get what you want 
if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory 
problem has been favouring certain ethnic groups beyond reasonability people are people for example employment should go to the best qualified candidate regardless of race or ethnic creed an assumption is made on the governments part that an employer will unfairly select anglo saxon over other races which is wrong therefore the employer must use race based quota agendas to effect equality

apparently it is too much to ask for 
both presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump and former president bill clinton have ties to convicted pedophile and democratic donor billionaire jeffery epstein and sex slave island 
note president bill clinton is not merely the husband of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton either bill is currently campaigning for his wife plus hillary recently unveiled that bill with be in charge of  revitalizing the economy  if she were to take office 
it has been uncovered that clinton known for his troublemaking libido has even stronger ties to epstein than previously reported as noted by the free beacon  clinton was aboard the infamous lolita express owned by a billionaire pedophile at least  times not the initially reported  times 
fox news reports  
clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girlsofficial flight logs filed with the federal aviation administration show clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as  us secret service agents however on a fiveleg asia trip between may  and may   not a single secret service agent is listed 
the republican presumptive nominee apparently got in on the action too trumps ties to epstein  a man trump once called a terrific guy  and sex slave island have been chronicled by the daily wire here  
per the political insider trump is accused of threatening and raping a yearold girl on the private island  epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct the lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the trump camp alleging that the filing is a hoax and that there is no evidence that the plaintiff in question actually exists 
sex slave island sometimes referred to as orgy island both lovely names is one deranged place allegedly rife with solicited sex often from minors  groomed  by epstein 
terrific guy epstein of course was convicted for soliciting sex from a minor in  the billionaire served  months in prison

more details are emerging about yesterdays police action on highway  about three miles from the cannonball river commencing shortly before noon a large contingent of heavily armed officers worked to clear a route for dakota access oil pipeline dapl trenches in a relentless push that resulted in numerous instances of violent confrontations culminating in the seizure of the newly established treaty camp and removal of a number of tents tipis and sweat lodges 
the morton county sheriffs department said that  people had been arrested and that at least one bullet had been fired from the frontlines 
officers met violence and resistance including a protester who fired a gun at officers in the police line protesters who threw molotov cocktails at them and set vehicles and debris on fire the sheriffs office said in a post on facebook  
an ap news story cites state spokesperson cecily wong describing a woman who drew a  caliber pistol and firing three times at officers an account disputed by activists and not recorded on any of the onthescene video or live feeds currently circulating 
however tribal law enforcement apprehended a heavilyarmed man crouched in a creek with apparent connections to a private security firm hired by dapls builders the standing rock sioux tribe posted a description of the incident on its facebook page  a man was apprehended carrying an assault rifle with papers indicating he was employed by a private security firm according to the standing rock sioux tribe 
as reported via video evidence from the front lines on  a man bearing an assault rifle broke thru a barricade and was speeding toward the oceti sakowin camp he was run off the road  mile north from the camp the man exited the vehicle where he appeared to be disguised as a water protector he than fired several shots from his assault rifle tribal law enforcement responded the man was then apprehended insurance documents from the vehicle reveal that it is owned by dakota access pipeline we commend the bia law enforcement to their commitment of public safety and for their quick response and apprehension of the suspect who was clearly meaning to do harm 
a statement by the camp of the sacred stones one of three prayer camps set up near the standing rock sioux reservation catalogued exactly how the unarmed protectors were met by lots of firepower over  police officers in riot gear  atvs  armored vehicles  helicopters and numerous militarygrade humvees showed up north of the newly formed frontline camp just east of highway  the  treaty camp was set up this past sunday directly in the path of the pipeline on land recently purchased by dapl today this camp a reclamation of unceded lakota territory affirmed as part of the standing rock reservation in the ft laramie treaty of  was violently cleared both blockades established this past weekend to enable that occupation were also cleared 
at least one sniper atop a humvee scanned the crowd of protectors people and horses were shot at with beanbag guns noise concussion devices were used and fireextinguishersized canisters of tear gas and mace were deployed police used pepper spray and mace liberally photo savannah joefacebook 
standing rock sioux chairman david archambault ii blasted the use of force the continued construction and the numerous violations of civil and human rights 
we have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights he said in a statement today we have witnessed people praying in peace yet attacked with pepper spray rubber bullets sound and concussion cannons we urge state and federal government agencies to give this tense situation their immediate and close attention 
he noted that dapl parent company energy transfer partners had completely ignored the request by the administration of president barack obama to voluntarily halt construction while the legal issues raised by the tribe were resolved 
by deploying law enforcement to support dapl construction the state of north dakota is collaborating with energy transfer partners and escalating tensions archambault said we need our state and federal governments to bring justice and peace to our lands not the force of armored vehicles 
archambault urged everyone who supports standing rocks efforts to divert or halt the pipeline to remain peaceful and prayerful and not resort to violence or lash out in anger 
any act of violence hurts our cause and is not welcome here he said we invite all supporters to join us in prayer that ultimately the right decisionthe moral decisionis made to protect our people our sacred places our land and our resources we wont step down from this fight as peoples of this earth we all need water this is about our water our rights and our dignity as human beings 
firsthand accounts bore stark witness to the events as they happened via facebook live feeds social media posts and other dispatches from the front lines 
dallas goldtooth organizer of the keep it in the ground movement with the indigenous environmental network posted updates throughout the day 
president obama had asked that work stop within  miles of river yet national guard were used to clear the way for yesterdays police sweep  dapl construction he wrote dapl security forces were part of the invasion they had armed men with ar and had malicious intent to sneak into the camp 
he said that men and women had been pulled out of a sweat lodge ceremony at gunpoint 
the similarities to wounded knee cannot be ignored there was potential last night to turn a peaceful protest into a major tragedy he wrote 
goldtooth also contrasted such treatment of unarmed water protectors with the acquittal on the same day of the armed militia who took over malheur wildlife refuge 
the racial undertones of yesterdays actions cannot be ignored goldtooth wrote armed white men stand off against police in oregon acquitted unarmed water protectors in north dakota concussion grenades rubber bullets and batons 
he said that north dakota polices characterization of them as armed vigilantes was patently false jesus wagner was shot in the face with a rubber bullet photo facebook 
the only weapons on site yesterday were in the hands of militarized police he wrote assault rifles snipers concussion grenades batons etc 
the harm was not limited to humans riders on horseback were also assaulted and one horse was killed 
horseback riders were attacked by police on atvs resulting in one horse being hurt so severely that it had to be put down goldtooth said there were national guard humvees on site with snipers stationed on top 
not even medical personnel were immune 
they sprayed me with my hands up and my back to them with all my medic markings clearly showing they sprayed me head to toe said one man in a facebook post by the standing rock medic  healer council they pointed shotguns at me they pointed shotguns at my back while i was treating patients 
jon eagle sr tribal historic preservation officer of the standing rock sioux tribe spoke of the heartbreak 
my heart hurts he said on facebook because of the actions of a few many people were hurt today people were shot with rubber bullets and beanbags they used pepper spray percussion grenades and sound cannons numerous arrests i cant believe what i witnessed today and its still going on prayers for the protectors tonight 
there were uplifting moments as well as the conflict escalated a woman yelled at everyone to look at the buffalo 
we all turned to the east to see a herd of buffalo come charging eagle said behind them were young warriors on horse back police in atvs charged after them there were shots fired the young men rode through the line of atvs and made their get away a war cry went up from the crowd im proud to say we are still the greatest light cavalry in the world 
many activists and protectors used social media to describe feelings of nausea lightheadedness and sickness after returning to the camps near standing rock and also this morning as a new uncertain day dawned on the plains

brooding and bearded face shadowed by an odd hat cutlass scars on his arms and a dark patch where his eye ought to be the pirate is a familiar stereotype countless movies have worn him down to a smooth and unremarkable cliche 
but what if that cliche has depths that have yet to be mined by the movie industry 
that is the question that israeliamerican director arnon z shorr blood and stone a legend of the golem a modest suggestion glimpse has chosen to tap into with the pirate captain toledano  beneath the pirates hat hides another sort of hat a jewish one for the pirate captain toledano is a jewish pirate what sort of jew becomes a pirate and why 
touching on true history that is one of the questions that shorrs film proposes to answer 
recent years have seen growing interest in the history of jewish pirates and what initially seems absurd quickly becomes a fascinating exploration of how much of history is lost when legend becomes cliche as a pioneering filmmaker arnon z shorr has chosen to tackle this ambitious project with the aid of two vessels at the ocean institute a dedicated cast and support from the public 
though the process of bringing the pirate captain toledano from vision to reality has only begun the journey has already been marked by fortuitous coincidences including the discovery that cast member stephen decordova captain toledano hailed from ancestors who were jewish pirates and a treasured kiddush cup in his possession which likely dates back from those days will play a key role in the story

Infowars.com,2016-10-28T05:09:26.974+03:00,shocking michele obama  hillary caught glamorizing date rape promoters,"most top retailers sell food produced with beekilling pesticides only aldi costco and whole foods got passing grades julie fidler  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new scorecard report gives a failing grade to  out of  major food retailers in the united states based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection organic options and pesticide reduction  source friends of the earth 
tiffany finckhaynes food futures campaigner with friends of the earth said 
us food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis 
the majority of the food sold at top us food retailers is produced with pollinatortoxic pesticides we urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinatortoxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators people and the planet  organic offerings and transparency are lacking 
the report swarming the aisles rating top retailers on beefriendly and organic food is the work of a coalition led by friends of the earth and more than  farmer beekeeper farmworker environmental and public interest organizations  
the coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators  and increase us department of agriculture usda certified organic food and beverages to  of overall offerings by  the group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic regional and local producers 
friends of the earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than  garden retailers including lowes and home depot to commit to eliminate pollinatortoxic neonicotinoid neonic pesticides 
according to haynes the demand for organic foods has grown by doubledigits  but grocers arent keeping up she said 
a lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future  
as evidenced by the groups research its difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food eleven of the  retailers websites examined by friends of the earth dont provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food pollinators andor pesticides  haynes said adding 
theres a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings and then be able to sell that in their stores americans are ready for change 
a yougov poll released  october  by friends of the earth and sumofus reveals that  of americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture  and  of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids  
additionally the poll shows that  of respondents believe its important for supermarkets to sell organic food another  said theyd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent 
said angus wong lead campaign strategist at sumofus a consumer watchdog with ten million members 
over  sumofus members have spoken out advocating that us hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators and after years of pressure home depot and lowes have finally enacted more beefriendly policies 
and the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too this is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately 
only four of the nations top food retailers  albertsons costco target and whole foods  have adopted and made public a companywide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food  they are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer or organic sales 
aldi food lion part of the delhaize group and kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales 
none of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from american farmers  retailer apathy is killing pollinators 
of the top  food retailers surveyed by friends of the earth a shocking  were predominantly unresponsive to friends of the earths requests for information via surveys calls and letters the group was forced to turn to publicly available information including company websites company annual reports us securities and exchange commission filings corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports press coverage and industry analyses for their data 
we have bees to thank for every  in  bites of food we take  and without bees stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds source bee cause 
science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline glyphosate the main ingredient in monsantos blockbuster herbicide roundup has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines  
several us cities have banned neonics including boulder city colorado  and portland oregon  this past spring maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides

conservatives claim that voter id is necessary to catch illegal voters but it turns out theyre the only ones creating fake ids to use on election day 
trump supporters are taking trumps call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake id badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them confusing them and filming them  all of which are illegal 
but trumps deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a rightwing group known as vote protectors 
the group which is affiliated with top trump ally roger stone is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on election day they are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes 
according to the huffington post  
stones group created an officiallooking id badge for its volunteers to wear and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake exit polls efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters or at least thats what the group was planning to do before the huffington post asked stone about it on tuesday the controversial trump ally long known for his bareknuckled political tactics said that key proposals on his groups websites were there without his knowledge and assured huffpost that he would operate within the confines of election law 
in fact after huffpo confronted stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website he acknowledged that vote protectors had a bad idea and ordered them taken down 
campaign legal center deputy director danielle lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme 
its inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy she told huffpo in reference to the videotaping when thats being live streamed to the internet it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls objectively intimidating voters is unlawful no matter where you do it 
indeed but thats exactly what donald trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him 
as it turns out hes right about the election being rigged only its conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of trump 
earlier this week a wisconsin city clerk in green bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the wisconsin ethics commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the university of wisconsingreen bay because she has merely heard that students lean democrat 
i was reading the statutes and read no site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party republican appointed clerk kris teske wrote 
uwgb is a polling location for students and residents on election day but i feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole i have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat i have spoken with our chief of staff and others at city hall and they agree that budget wise this isnt going to happen i would like to know your thoughts on this do i have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats 
so not only are trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods they are using voter suppression tactics as well 
and that is likely going to cause a lot of election day chaos voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what trumps deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it

one thing that has continuously dogged the donald trump for president campaign is the fact that racists antisemites xenophobes misogynists and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign no matter how much trumps people try to say he doesnt want the support of such folks the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously so naturally when trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway sat down with an interview with cnns jake tapper on sunday  that particular issue came up again of course conway was not happy tapper began 
there are a lot of antisemites and racists and misogynists who support the trump candidacy 
conway immediately went on defense saying wow tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting jewsa at the press pen at a recent trump rally and directly asked conway if she would refer to such people as deplorable she responded 
yes i would wow i have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe  i hope youve been to trump rallies and i hope that youve seen the tens of thousands i mean hes had over half a million people easily i think in excess of that these are usaloving americans 
tapper went on to say that no he isnt putting all trump supporters into that camp but went on to force conways hand on this one 
but without question people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are antisemitic that has been offered to people who are antisemitic and racists and on and on and these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting mr trump 
mr trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and antisemitic fans tapper continued he just has he says things like oh sure i disavow i disavow but he has never serious said i dont want the support of those people they are reprehensible they have nothing to do with me he has never seriously done it 
conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the trump campaign is winning saying 
i think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence i have that were actually going to win in nine days because the idea that were going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that hillary clinton would bring to the oval office in such an important week 
no kellyanne its not a sign that trump is winning its pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began that donald trump is a raging bigot and he has been so openly dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle and its all because of donald trump he embraces these bigots because hes one of them the quicker you learn that the better
